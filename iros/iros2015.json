        "abstract": "This paper presents a mechanism for the robot moving inside of pipelines. The mechanism is composed of the 2-2D differential gear mechanism, the active adhesion mechanism, and the rescue mechanism. The 2-2D differential gear mechanism is designed to be driven with single actuator at any elbow type pipelines without any additional control efforts. The active adhesion mechanism is for providing sufficient adhesion forces of the robot on climbing over the pipelines against the gravity. In addition the rescue mechanism is designed for retrieving the robot safely in emergency situation. In this paper, three proposed mechanisms are explained in details and their effectiveness is experimentally demonstrated.",

        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "We introduce a novel approach to simultaneous localization and mapping for robots equipped with a 2D laser scanner. In particular, we propose a fast scan registration algorithm that operates on 2D maps represented as a signed distance function (SDF). Using SDFs as a map representation has several advantages over existing approaches: while classical 2D scan matchers employ brute-force matching to track the position of the robot, signed distance functions are differentiable on large parts of the map. Consequently, efficient minimization techniques such as Gauss-Newton can be applied to find the minimum. In contrast to occupancy grid maps, the environment can be captured with sub-grid cell size precision, which leads to a higher localization accuracy. Furthermore, SDF maps can be triangulated to polygon maps for efficient storage and transfer. In a series of experiments, conducted both in simulation and on a real physical platform, we demonstrate that SDF tracking is more accurate and efficient than previous approaches. We outperform scan matching on occupancy maps in simulation by ~270% in terms of root mean squared deviation (RMSD) with a ~63% lower standard deviation. In the real robot experiments, we obtain a performance advantage of ~14% RMSD with a ~25% lower standard deviation.",

        "abstract": "Exploration of unknown environments is an important aspect to fielding teams of robots. Without the ability to determine on their own where to go in the environment, the full potential of robotic teams is limited to the abilities of human operators to deploy them for search and rescue, mapping, or other tasks that are predicated on gaining knowledge from the environment. This is of particular importance in real-world 3-Dimensional (3-D) environments where simple planar assumptions can lead to incomplete exploration, for example, real-world environments have areas underneath overhangs or inside caves. As an additional challenge, when the teams of robots have vastly different capabilities, the planning system must take those into account to efficiently utilize the available assets. In this paper, we present a combined air-ground system for conducting 3-D exploration in cluttered environments. We first describe the hardware and software components of the system. We then present our algorithm for planning 3-D goal locations for a heterogeneous team of robots to efficiently explore a previously unknown environment and demonstrate its applicability in real-world experiments.",

        "abstract": "In this paper, we present an efficient 3-DOF registration method to align two overlapping point clouds captured by a range sensor that experiences locally planar motion such as in many robotics applications. The algorithm follows the RANSAC framework and is based on finding a pair of congruent triangles in the source and target clouds. With the assumption of planar sensor motion, corresponding vertices of the congruent triangles must have similar elevation values, allowing our algorithm to identify them efficiently. Specifically, given a triangle in the source cloud, our algorithm first finds two vertices of a candidate congruent triangle in the target cloud and then uses the third vertex to verify, minimizing the complexity of the geometric base as well as the expected time of sampling successfully a matching congruent triangle. To improve the performance of our algorithm further, our verification of a hypothetical alignment transformation proceeds first locally by using only the points near the vertices of the congruent triangles before involving the entire cloud. Our experimental results show that the proposed algorithm outperforms state-of-the-art registration algorithms in the case of 3-DOF planar sensor motion.",

Our method requires no learning, has no limitation of object properties such as compactness or symmetry, and therefore produces object candidates using a completely general approach. This method is a simple combination of Selective Search, which is a non-learning-based objectness detector working in 2D images, and a supervoxel segmentation method, which works with 3D point clouds. We made a small but non-trivial modification to supervoxel segmentation; it brings better \u201cseeding\u201d for supervoxels, which produces more proper object candidates as a result. Our experiments using a couple of publicly available RGB-D datasets demonstrated that our method outperformed state-of-the-art methods of generating object proposals in 2D images.",

This article proposes a new method for actively exploring a 3D region of space with the aim of localizing special areas of interest for manipulation tasks over plants. In our method, exploration is guided by a multi-layer occupancy grid map. This map, together with a multiple-view estimator and a maximum-information-gain gathering approach, incrementally provides a better understanding of the scene until a task termination criterion is reached. This approach is designed to be applicable for any task entailing 3D object exploration where some previous knowledge of its general shape is available.

We also focus on the generation of paths with reduced length, allowing energy savings and minimizing the time for the task fulfillments. The proposed methodology provides, in a fast and iterative way, near-optimal paths in some scenarios, but with the advantage of continuous curvature and pitch rate profiles, a fundamental issue regarding the dynamics of real-world robots.

        "abstract": "In indoor spaces, plane features are general geometric primitives that are robust to noise. To estimate the relative displacement and orientation between two consecutive 3D poses, at least three-pair correspondences of planes with different normals are needed at both poses. Otherwise, the estimated state falls into degeneracy, which is usually caused by the narrow field-of-view (FoV) of sensors as well as environmental structures. In the case where there are changes in degeneracy, with the exception of rotation, the state can be resolved using existing methods. To compensate for rotation in degeneracy for one-pair correspondences, the main approach is to project the initial prediction of an inertial measurement unit's (IMU) orientation to the normal of the corresponding plane such that it satisfies the shortest arc length. We also propose an algorithm that detects various degeneracy cases through which a seamless implementation becomes feasible, regardless of the number of plane pairs. We show the usefulness of the proposed method by performing a 3D mapping experiment where several degenerate cases arise due to limited FoV.",

        "abstract": "This paper presents a highly compact fibre-optic system based on light intensity modulation for multi-segment flex sensing in pliable robot arms, e.g., articulated surgical instruments. This fibre-optic arrangement is 7.5 mm in diameter and is comprised of a two-segment flexible and stretchable Steiner chain arm section with twelve housings at the distal side which accommodates passive cables. The displacement of each cable will be used to determine the bending. This Steiner chain section is followed by a basal rigid fibre-optic sensing unit integrated with a low-friction retractable distance modulation array which couples the motion of the passive cables with light-emitting optical fibres. The low-friction retractable distance modulation array uses steel spring-needle double sliders to reduce the hysteresis and to recover reference sensor values when the arm returns to its original straight configuration. The U-shape loopback design of the optical fibres allows integration of all electronics away from the sensing site. The experimental results indicate a maximum bending angle error of 6\u00b0 in one individual segment of the two-segment arm with respect to reference angle values calculated from camera images.",

        "abstract": "This paper introduces a novel Balance Feedback Interface (BFI) that addresses the problem of bilateral feedback for teleoperation of humanoid robots. With this new device we expect to enhance robot's high force manipulation performance to a level comparable to humans by dynamically synchronizing master and slave. Through this Human-Machine Interface (HMI) we aim to achieve two goals: (i) have the human pilot learn from the robot's dynamic behavior; and (ii) have the humanoid robotic platform learn from human's motor skills. The eventual goal is to fuse the teleoperator's commands and an autonomous controller for optimal performance. Initial results evaluate the stability of the robot while being teleoperated by a human pilot for a simple upright balancing task. During the experiment the user has no visual information about the robot's state and is expected to compensate for unpredicted instabilities. The bilateral feedback system shows robustness to inertial variations and to external disturbances with the proposed human-in-the-loop control strategy offering valuable insight for future work.",

        "abstract": "Seagoing vessels have to undergo regular visual inspections in order to detect the typical defective situations affecting metallic structures, such as cracks and corrosion. These inspections are currently performed by ship surveyors manually at a great cost. To make ship inspections safer and more cost-efficient, this paper presents a Micro-Aerial Vehicle (MAV) intended for visual inspection and based on supervised autonomy. On the one hand, the vehicle is equipped with a vision system that effectively teleports the surveyor from the base station to the areas of the hull that need inspection. On the other hand, the MAV is the result of a complete redesign of a visual inspection-oriented aerial platform that we proposed some years ago, with the aim of introducing the surveyor in the control loop and, in this way, enlarge the range of inspection operations that can robustly be carried out. Another goal is to make the platform as usable as possible for a non-expert. All this has been accomplished by means of the definition of different autonomous functions, including obstacle detection and collision prevention, and extensive use of behavior-based high-level control. The results of some experiments conducted to assess both the performance and usability of the platform are discussed at the end of the paper.",

Because of the uncertainty and vibration induced by high-speed navigation and rugged terrain, the problem of mapping for high-speed off-road autonomous navigation has not been completely solved yet. A relative probabilistic mapping (RPM) algorithm is introduced to address the problem. Firstly, the relative probabilistic map is updated by Kalman filter and Gaussian Mixture algorithm based on the probabilistic exteroceptive measurements model. Then, terrain traversability is evaluated to identify obstacles in the map. Experiments on off-road high-speed autonomous vehicle, which suffers from severe vibration, with different sensor configurations are carried out to demonstrate the capability of the RPM algorithm.",

The algorithm adapts the relative importance of the sensor measurements, compared to the model predictions, in real time; yielding a filter that is robust to noisy observations and sensor blackouts. The filter is constructed using a Variational Bayes Approximation of the conditional probability distribution of the system's state; i.e., the probability distribution of the state, given the measurements from the sensors. The algorithm is evaluated both in simulation and experimentally on a robotic platform. In the experiments, the sensor measurements from an Autonomous Underwater Vehicle (AUV) are altered artificially. The sensor output is either corrupted with outliers or manually stuck to a constant value; simulating in this fashion a sensor defect. In both cases, the filter reconstructs the robot's state accurately, thus enabling the vehicle to resume with mission execution.",

        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "Application domains of robotic systems are growing in complexity. It seems therefore plausible that robotic software will continue to be designed to be executed on distributed computer architectures interconnected through a network. It is a common practice today to rely on best-effort performance and assume that the latter are adequate given enough computational and networking resources. This approach however does not make best use of the available resources and, maybe more importantly, does not guarantee that performance remain constant over time. Real-time and Quality of Service become therefore important aspects in the software architecture of a robot. This article describes an approach for introducing these concepts in a publish-subscribe software middleware. The key contribution of our approach is that it leverages on the services provided by the operating system (scheduling priority and packet QoS) and abstracts them in a set of levels of priority that can be assigned dynamically, and with the granularity of individual communication channels. We implemented our approach on the YARP middleware and performed an experimental evaluation that demonstrates its benefit for increasing determinism and reducing latency in data communication. We further demonstrate this in a real-robot experiment that shows increased performance in a closed-loop scenario.",

The flight phase is controlled by a novel nonlinear control concept that accounts for state and input contraints on the hip and tail while pursuing a linear error dynamics for the desired landing angle of the leg. An additional nonlinear model predictive control (MPC) scheme is superposed to coordinate the hopping cycles and to maximize the hopping speed. The MPC can be designed with a simple nonlinear optimization algorithm, as the constraints are already accounted for by the cascaded controller. Simulation results for a nonlinear dynamical model of the Festo BionicKangaroo show the working principle of the bi-level predictive control scheme.",

The simulation results are encouraging since they indicate the materialization potential of the topology, both in terms of control and of low power, two essential factors in making the presence of an implant in the human body feasible.

The planner takes segments spatial configuration into account and solves a problem similar to the Multiple Travelling Salesman Problem (MTSP) in order to assign a sequence of segments to each vehicle. The contribution of this paper is in implementation details of the planner based on a specific mission mathematical model, its field test results and analysis for a group composed from an Autonomous Surface Vehicle (ASV) and an Autonomous Underwater Vehicle (AUV).",

        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "Computing time optimal motions along specified paths forms an integral part of the solution methodology for many motion planning problems. Conventionally, this optimal control problem is solved considering piece-wise constant parametrization for the control input which leads to convexity and sparsity in the optimization structure. However, it also results in discontinuous control trajectory which is difficult to track. Thus, in this paper we revisit this time optimal control problem with the primary motivation of ensuring a high degree of smoothness in the resulting motion profile. In particular, we solve it with continuity constraints in control and higher order motion derivatives like jerk, snap etc. It is clear that such constraints would necessitate the use of time varying control inputs over the commonly used piece-wise constant form. The primary contribution of the current work lies in the introduction of a C\u221e class of time scaling functions represented as parametric exponentials. This in turn allows us to represent time varying control inputs as products of parametric exponential and a polynomial functions. We present the motivation behind adopting such representation of time scaling function over more common polynomial forms, both from mathematical as well as implementation standpoint. We also show that the proposed representation of time scaling function and control input leads to a very simple optimization structure where most of the constraints are linear. The non-linearity has a quasi-convex structure which can be reformulated into a simple difference of convex form. Thus, the resulting optimization can be efficiently solved through sequential convex programming where, at each iteration, the constraints in difference of convex form are further simplified to more conservative linear constraints.",

        "abstract": "We study the contact-aware state estimation (CASE) problem, i.e., the problem of estimating the state of an object while it is being actively manipulated by a robot. Several researchers have developed particle filters for this problem. They estimate the state (pose and velocity) of manipulated objects, some physical properties (such as mass and shape), and contact information (such as, gain or loss of contact and transitions between sliding and sticking). However, the effects of various contact and noise models, which can have a huge impact on the estimation results, are obfuscated by implementation details. In this paper, we study the CASE problem arising from a simple pushing task with the goal of shedding light on the fundamental contact modeling choices. Specifically, we evaluate four particle filters based upon four probabilistic state transition models generated from a deterministic multibody dynamics models with rigid or compliant contacts, each of which is augmented by one of two different noise models. Comparisons of these state transition models are carried out through the analysis of real and simulated experiments, the results of which, provide guidance to filter designers.",

Herein we present an EKF-SLAM algorithm which allows using radio frequency (RF) beacons without any prior knowledge of their location. As RF beacons provide only range information, recovering their positions is not an easy task. For this range-only SLAM case, a new procedure to instantiate the beacons in the filter is proposed. The method uses two range measurements from different robot's positions to initialize two hypotheses for the beacon's location, which are then integrated in the filter as a Gaussian mixture. This approach is evaluated and compared to other initialization techniques in simulation and with a real dataset. The results show that our approach performs as well as the other existing methods for both trajectory and map errors with a low computational cost.",

The model does not rely on numeric functions nor does it impose any restrictions upon the geometry of personal space. The approach is applied to human-aware robot activity placement planning: Given an activity type and a robot that is to perform an activity of this type, principles of personal space use determine the reasons pros and cons to place that particular activity at a particular affordance space. The symbolic representations of personal spaces enable robots to make choices and to communicate the reasons for their choices to humans.",

We propose a cross-helical tendons actuated DCM that can realize S shapes just using one segment. With two pairs of cross-helical tendons, it can realize omin-directional S shapes, where two types of planar S shapes are investigated in this paper. A prototype with 8mm diameter and 80mm length is built and the kinematics characteristics are investigated. The results show it can well realize the desired S shapes. The tip directional capability and obstacles avoidance capability are compared with C shape DCM.",

Using multi-robot systems for event exploration brings major challenges such as finding and communicating relevant information. This paper presents a solution to these challenges in the form of a distributed decision-theoretic model called MAPING (Multi-Agent Planning for INformation Gathering), in which each agent computes a communication and an exploration strategy by assessing the relevance of an observation for another agent. The agents use an extended belief state that contains not only their own beliefs but also approximations of other agents' beliefs. MAPING includes a forgetting mechanism to ensure that the event-exploration remains open-ended. To overcome the resolution complexity due to the extended belief state we use a method based on the well-known adopted assumption of variables independence. We evaluate our approach on different event exploration problems with varying complexity. The experimental results on simulation show the effectiveness of MAPING, its ability to scale up and its ability to face real-word applications.",

        "abstract": "In this paper, we present a novel approach to 2D street map-based localization for mobile robots that navigate mainly in urban sidewalk environments. Recently, localization based on the map built by Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) has been widely used with great success. However, such methods limit robot navigation to environments whose maps are prebuilt. In other words, robots cannot navigate in environments that they have not previously visited. We aim to relax the restriction by employing existing 2D street maps for localization. Finding an exact match between sensor data and a street map is challenging because, unlike maps built by robots, street maps lack detailed information about the environment (such as height and color). Our approach to coping with this difficulty is to maximize statistical dependence between sensor data and the map, and localization is achieved through maximization of a Mutual Information-based criterion. Our method employs a computationally efficient estimator of Squared-loss Mutual Information through which we achieved near real-time performance. The effectiveness of our method is evaluated through localization experiments using real-world data sets.",

We consider the case in which each robot is an autonomous decision maker that is anonymous (i.e., robots are indistinguishable to one another), memoryless (i.e., each robot makes decisions based upon only its current information), and dimensionless (i.e., collision checking is not considered). Each robot has a limited sensing range, and is able to directly estimate the state of only those robots within that sensing range, which induces a network topology for the multi-robot systems. We assume that it is not possible for the fault-free robots to identify the faulty robots (e.g., due to the anonymous property of the robots). Our main result is a practical algorithm that achieves approximate rendezvous in the face of faulty robots under a few assumptions on the network topology. In simulation results, we show that our algorithm performs better in the face of faulty robots than other contemporary convergence algorithms, e.g., the circumcenter law, and local coordinate averaging.",

        "abstract": "We develop a stochastic framework for modeling and analysis of robot navigation in the presence of obstacles. We show that, with appropriate assumptions, the probability of a robot avoiding a given obstacle can be reduced to a function of a single dimensionless parameter which captures all relevant quantities of the problem. This parameter is analogous to the P\u00e9clet number considered in the literature on mass transport in advection-diffusion fluid flows. Using the framework we also compute statistics of the time required to escape an obstacle in an informative case. The results of the computation show that adding noise to the navigation strategy can improve performance. Finally, we present experimental results that illustrate these performance improvements on a robotic platform.",

        "abstract": "This work addresses the task-space design problem of a linear-quadratic optimal tracking controller for robotic manipulators using the unit dual quaternion formalism. The efficiency, compactness, and lack of singularity of the representation render the unit dual quaternion a suitable framework for simultaneously describing the attitude and the position of the end-effector. Motivated by the advantages of this kinematic description, we propose a new task-space linear-quadratic optimal tracking controller in order to find an optimal trajectory for the end-effector, providing a tool to balance more conveniently the end-effector error and its task-space velocity. This is possible because the kinematic control problem using the dual quaternion transformation invariant error can be reduced to an affine time-varying system. The proposed optimal tracking controller allows the compensation of trajectory induced disturbances, as well as other modeled additive disturbances and known bias. Simulation results with different design parameters provide a performance overview, in comparison with standard kinematic controllers with and without a feed-forward term, for tracking a desired reference.",

The results show that the majority of the cost-to-go map values, computed from every terrain location with respect to the goal location, are near-optimal.

Despite a continuous technological advancement, many challenges are to be faced before establishing the use of these devices as part of the rehabilitation process. A main concern is how to actively engage the users and monitor how they are affected by the exoskeleton. Basic analyses, such as measuring walking speed, must be extended to include analysis on balance, brain activity, and evaluation of neuromechanical effects. This scenario requires the use of different distributed sensor devices that must be carefully synchronized. This work describes the architecture we implemented to extend the capabilities of the H2 exoskeleton. As a proof of the architecture validity, we show the online estimation of users' muscle forces through the acquisition of electromyographic signals, that drive neuromusculoskeletal models. The proposed framework, built upon the Robot Operating System (ROS), aims to be reusable for a wide range of setups, including different exoskeletons and sensors.",

The method is verified by a robotic assembly workcell which includes dual robots and a simple machine vision unit. The basic algorithms for image processing, task planning, dual robot cooperative motion and path planning are developed for assembling a simple structure which predominantly formed by T-joint sections.

Every year a forced closure of the canals in the Indus basin is inevitable for canal cleaning, entailing a very large scale and costly operation. Silt removal precision is prone to inefficiencies due to subjective decision making in the cleaning process. In this paper, we lay out a theoretical framework to map the semi-structured (emptied) canal bed terrains with an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) system for quantitative inspection of deposited silt. The study employs Gaussian process regression on sampled points to determine a continuous distribution of silt surface, thereby, predicting the volume of silt on canal bed. Our theoretical analysis builds upon certain mathematical bounds on the variance of estimated volume, while explicitly considering localization error and sensor noise. Essentially, we setup a framework for studying how tolerable are the process and measurement uncertainties, while achieving a desired accuracy in silt profile and corresponding volume. We demonstrate the regression results in simulations as well as lab-scaled-model (LMS151 laser scanner) with different sets of parameters. Volume estimation is verified practically and mathematical performance limits are proposed in established aerial canal inspection system.",

Several supervised learning methods have been proposed for this purpose, but we seek a method that can build models on-the-fly and adapt to new people and new motion styles as they emerge. Thus, unlike previous work, we propose an unsupervised online learning approach to the problem, which requires no offline training or manual categorization of trajectories. Our approach consists of a two-layer library of Gaussian Mixture Models that can be used both for recognition and prediction. We do not assume that the number of motion classes is known a priori, and thus the library grows if it cannot explain a new observed trajectory. Given an observed portion of a trajectory, the framework can predict the remainder of the trajectory by first determining what GMM it belongs to, and then using Gaussian Mixture Regression to predict the remainder of the trajectory. We tested our method on motion-capture data recorded during assembly tasks. Our results suggest that the proposed framework outperforms supervised methods in terms of both recognition and prediction. We also show the benefit of using our two-layer framework over simpler approaches.",

        "abstract": "The identification of the dynamic model of a robotic manipulator represents a fundamental step for designing high performance model-based controllers. Despite the huge number of works presented on this topic, the symbolic dynamic model reduction (i.e., the identification of the set of parameters observable through the measure of joint torques and positions) still remain a challenging task, characterized from tailored solutions, adapted from time to time to specific families of mechanisms. The work here presented, introduces an automatic and analytical reduction of the dynamic model, based on a multi-dimensional Fourier series decomposition of the dynamic equations. The procedure enables to obtain symbolically the base dynamic parameters (BP) starting from a given kinematic structure. The Fourier based model reduction can be applied indifferently both to open- and closed-chain kinematics. A simulated example shows the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.",

        "abstract": "In this paper we present a novel whole-body compliance framework. It is based on the Multi Spring Model, a set of virtual springs interconnecting the limb extremities and the trunk as well. More specifically, six virtual springs connect the trunk of the robot to the feet and the hands and other six springs interconnect the limb extremities. By selecting the stiffness values of each individual spring, complex behaviors can be generated, opening the way for more challenging tasks. The framework is implemented in a multi-layer architecture that distributes the computation on the different control units available on the robot. The proposed method was tested in two different tasks using the COmpliant huMANoid (COMAN), a full-body torque-controlled humanoid robot. For the first task, the robot was able to grasp a box, lift it up and firmly hold it. In the second task, the robot balanced itself while having the hands in contact with two walls. COMAN was able to successfully perform both tasks while perturbed by external disturbances and environmental uncertainties.",

        "abstract": "Consider a mobile robot exploring an initially unknown school building and assume that it has already discovered some classrooms, offices, and bathrooms. What can the robot infer about the presence and the locations of other classrooms and offices in the school building? This paper makes a step toward providing an answer to the above question by proposing a system based on a generative model that is able to represent the topological structures and the semantic labeling schemas of buildings and to predict the structure and the schema for unexplored portions of these environments. We represent the buildings as undirected graphs, whose nodes are rooms and edges are physical connections between them. Given an initial knowledge base of graphs, our approach, relying on a spectral analysis of these graphs, segments each graph for finding significant subgraphs and clusters them according to their similarity. A graph representing a new building or an unvisited part of a building is eventually generated by sampling subgraphs from clusters and connecting them.",

Firstly, in order to optimize the repair path in a distributed manner, a gradient generation and diffusion mechanism is proposed to generate a specific gradient distribution in the formation. Then, utilizing several predefined path selection rules, a path selection algorithm is presented to guarantee the optimality of the selected repair path. Furthermore, several optimization indices are presented to quantitatively characterize the performance of self-healing algorithms. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm is validated by numerical simulations and the simulation results show that the proposed algorithm can restore the topology of the formation with the fewer repair robots and lower energy consumptions.",

Through the admittance and impedance models, the haptic shared controller smoothly puts together human operator inputs with robot autonomy. Further, the level of autonomy is fully determined by the operator with the grasp motion. A decomposed design has been taken for the autonomous controller of the mobile robot. The algorithm was implemented on the haptic interface omega.7 together with a QBot mobile robot, and its feasibility and efficacy have been validated by experiments.",

One fundamental task for a social robot is to move to the person of interest in order to start interacting or perform a service. In this paper we address the task of a robot having to navigate to a possibly occluded person, which needs assistance, based only on audio and range information. Our approach is based on forming a heuristic cost function which is based on combining two audio features, and then moving to the optimum position indicated by this cost function after every interaction with the person. The method is compared to a greedy approach in 20 different tasks using a loud speaker playing at approximately 60dB sound pressure level (SPL) to mimic a human speaker, and the proposed method shows superior performance. A second experiment with an increase of 13dB SPL of the loud speaker is conducted and the proposed method is able to handle this.",

Many machine learning approaches for activity recognition systems have been proposed recently. Most of these methods are built upon a strong assumption that the labels in the training data are noise-free, which is often not realistic. In this paper, we incorporate the uncertainty of labels into a max-margin learning algorithm, and the algorithm allows the labels to deviate over iterations in order to find a better solution. This is incorporated with a hierarchical approach where we jointly estimate activities at two different levels of granularity. The model is tested on two datasets, i.e., the CAD-120 dataset and the Accompany dataset, and the proposed model shows outperforming results over the state-of-the-art methods.",

        "abstract": "This study proposes a high-speed locomotion mechanism for a pipe-inspection robot. As a result of the narrow and complex structures of pipeline networks, it is difficult for robots to move quickly within the pipes. The new pneumatic mechanism proposed here realizes high-speed locomotion along with advantageous features for pipe inspection including a small diameter, flexibility, and low weight. First, we present the design concept of the novel locomotion mechanism using pneumatic flexible hollow-shaft actuators, which was previously developed by the authors. The prototype constructed to realize this concept and the associated mathematical model are then introduced. Second, the basic characteristics of the proposed mechanism are evaluated in terms of the holding force (generated by an expansion mechanism against the pipe wall) and the impellent force that induces forward motion in the robot. Finally, the in-pipe movement performance is confirmed. The experimental results show that the designed robot can be propelled inside a 53-mm-diameter pipe at a maximum speed of 250 mm/s, which is exceedingly faster than conventional designs.",

        "track": "main",
        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "It has long been assumed that for effective human-robot teaming, it is desirable for assistive robots to infer the goals and intents of the humans, and take proactive actions to help them achieve their goals. However, there has not been any systematic evaluation of the accuracy of this claim. On the face of it, there are several ways a proactive robot assistant can in fact reduce the effectiveness of teaming. For example, it can increase the cognitive load of the human teammate by performing actions that are unanticipated by the human. In such cases, even though the teaming performance could be improved, it is unclear whether humans are willing to adapt to robot actions or are able to adapt in a timely manner. Furthermore, misinterpretations and delays in goal and intent recognition due to partial observations and limited communication can also reduce the performance. In this paper, our aim is to perform an analysis of human factors on the effectiveness of such proactive support in human-robot teaming. We perform our evaluation in a simulated Urban Search and Rescue (USAR) task, in which the efficacy of teaming is not only dependent on individual performance but also on teammates' interactions with each other. In this task, the human teammate is remotely controlling a robot while working with an intelligent robot teammate `Mary'. Our main result shows that the subjects generally preferred Mary with the ability to provide proactive support (compared to Mary without this ability). Our results also show that human cognitive load was increased with a proactive assistant (albeit not significantly) even though the subjects appeared to interact with it less.",

The muscle motion formulas are established based on the finger physiological structure and Hill model. The equilibrium equations between exoskeleton and finger are connected by static analysis. In order to solve the redundancy problem of the system, a method based on the physiological cross-sectional area (PCSA) is adopted to get the optimized solution of muscle force, and an optimization method based on the total minimum error (TME) is presented to obtain the parameters of Hill model. The experimental setup is established to receive the finger data of motion and force for optimization. The approach proposed can get the quantifiable muscle parameters to study the statistical analysis of muscle motion and rehabilitation state. And it will be possible for the exoskeleton and the finger to be combined as a controlled plant so as to introduce muscle parameters into the controller design.",

The proposed algorithm does not rely on rendezvous and calculates the unknown relative poses from the local maps of the robots. As another contribution, the uncertainty of the relative poses is taken into account by propagating the uncertainty to the past and future information using a novel algorithm. Moreover, once the relative poses are known, the integration of the information from all robots is performed using a novel batch-mode algorithm, which is a fast and efficient approach to deal with the time complexity problem. The experimental results show the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms.",

Therefore, we designed a joystick mechanism that enables not only the generation of control commands for the equipment but also the adjustment of the reaction force during its operation. The adjustment of the reaction force enables the user to know if there is any interference between the equipment and the environment and to improve task performance. In our proposed mechanism, the elastic pins surround the tip of the joystick and restrict its movement by this contact. The reaction force is controlled easily by adjusting the support length of the elastic pins. This paper describes the detailed mechanism and its basic performance through several experiments.",

It puts more samples in regions where sensor data is able to achieve higher uncertainty reduction while maintaining adequate samples in regions where uncertainty reduction is poor. This leads to a less dense roadmap and hence results in significant time savings in the path search phase. We provide simulation results that show stochastic planners with our sampling strategy place less samples and find a well-localized path in shorter time with little compromise on the quality of path as compared to existing sampling techniques.

The controller uses interaction forces to estimate the desired walking speed. Instead of allowing each joint to move around a nominal trajectory, which could lead to infeasible gait patterns, the control algorithm proposed in this paper chooses joint trajectories for desired walking speed, which generates feasible gait patterns. With the interaction forces measured during walking, the walking speed intended by the patient is estimated. Then, based on the estimated walking speed, a reference trajectory stored in a database, which is checked if kinematic constraints required for walking are met, is chosen. Since checking feasibility is performed off-line before the training sessions, it is possible to ensure stability of walking without causing any computational time on-line.",

Its unique size makes is easily portable and enables the robot to enter and maneuver around in tight spaces such as air ducts. The design centers around a micro-quadcopter encased in a lightweight spherical exoskeleton that can rotate about the quadcopter. The spherical exoskeleton offers agile ground locomotion while maintaining characteristics of a basic aerial robot in flying mode. Details of the system modeling, design and fabrication are discussed, including the robot's turning capabilities over ground and the lightweight spring-steel exoskeleton. The prototype ATR is experimentally validated in aerial and terrestrial mode, and results show that the ATR traveling over the same distance in rolling mode is 260 percent more efficient than a traditional flying-only robot and in flying mode the system is only 39 percent less efficient. Experimental results also demonstrate transition between modes of locomotion and curved, rolling trajectories.",

        "abstract": "Robots are often equipped with 2D laser-rangefinders (LRFs) and cameras since they complement well to each other. In order to correctly combine the measurements from both sensors, it is required to know their relative pose, that is, to solve their extrinsic calibration. In this paper we present a simple, quick and effective minimal solution for the extrinsic calibration problem. Our approach does not require any onpurpose calibration pattern: it bases on the observation of an orthogonal trihedron, which is profusely found as corners in human-made scenarios. The proposal is validated with synthetic and real experiments, showing better performance than existing alternatives. An implementation of our approach is made available as open-source software.",

        "abstract": "Artefacts that are present in images taken from a moving rolling shutter camera degrade the accuracy of absolute pose estimation. To alleviate this problem, we introduce an addition linear velocity in the camera projection matrix to approximate the motion of the rolling shutter camera. In particular, we derive a minimal solution using the Gr\u00f6bner Basis that solves for the absolute pose as well as the motion of a rolling shutter camera. We show that the minimal problem requires 5-point correspondences and gives up to 8 real solutions. We also show that our formulation can be extended to use more than 5-point correspondences. We use RANSAC to robustly get all the inliers. In the final step, we relax the linear velocity assumption and do a non-linear refinement on the fuli motion, i.e. linear and angular velocities, and pose of the rolling shutter camera with all the inliers. We verify the feasibility and accuracy of our algorithm with both simulated and real-world datasets.",

        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "Vessel maintenance entails periodic visual inspections of internal and external parts of the hull in order to detect the typical defective situations affecting metallic structures. Nowadays, robots are becoming more and more important regarding these inspection tasks, since they can collect the requested information and, thus, prevent humans from performing tedious, and even dangerous tasks because of places hard to reach for humans. A Micro Aerial Vehicle (MAV) fitted with vision cameras can be used as part of an automated or semi-automated inspection strategy. The resulting collection of individual images, however, does not permit the surveyor to get a global overview of the state of the surface under inspection, apart from the fact that the defects can be separated into different consecutive images. Image mosaicing can certainly help in this case. To this end, in this paper, we propose a novel image mosaicing approach able to deal with this kind of scenarios. Our solution employs a graph-based registration method from which relevant topological relationships between (overlapping) images are found. This graph is built according to a visual index based on a Bag-of-Words (BoW) scheme making use of binary descriptors for speeding up the image description process. At the end of the paper, we report about the results of a number of experiments that validate our approach, including the outcome of defect detectors working directly over the mosaic.",

        "abstract": "Tactile sensing is of fundamental importance for object manipulation and perception. Several sensors for hands have been proposed in the literature, however, only a few of them can be fully integrated with robotic hands. Typical problems preventing integration include the need for deformable sensors that can be deployed on curved surfaces, and wiring complexity. In this paper we describe a fingertip for the hands of the iCub robot, each fingertip consists of 12 sensors. Our approach builds on previous work on the iCub tactile system. The sensing elements of the fingertip are capacitive sensors made from a flexible PCB, and a multi-layer fabric that includes the dielectric material and the conductive layer. The novelty the proposed sensor lies in incorporating the multi-layer fabric technology into a small fingertip sensor that can be attached to the hands of a humanoid robot. The new sensors are more robust. The manufacturing is easier and relies on industrial techniques for the fabrication of the components, which results in higher repeatability. We performed experimental characterization of the sensor. We show that the sensor is able to detect forces as low as 0.05 N with no cross-talk between the taxels. We identified some hysteresis in the response of the sensor which must be taken into account if the robot exerts large forces for a long period of time. The taxels have spatially overlapping receptive fields, this has been demonstrated to be a useful property that allows hyperacuity.",

The paper describes the principle of the foot sole and provides details of its design and implementation. Experimental trials were performed with the child size humanoid robot, COMAN, wearing the proposed feet to validate their performance during landing and walking. The results demonstrate that the proposed new passive damping mechanism can reduce effectively the ground reaction impact forces and oscillations while maintaining the foot/body posture.",

        "abstract": "In this paper, a new passivity-based technique is proposed to analyze and guarantee the stability of haptics-enabled telerobotic rehabilitation systems where there is a possibility of having more sources of non-passivity than communication delays. In practice, the difficulty of therapeutic exercises should be tuned taking into account the stage of physical disability. However, tuning the difficulty and intensity should not violate the stability of patient-robot interaction. This usually puts conservative prefixed limits on the allowable exercise intensity. In this paper, patient-robot interaction safety is studied in the context of Strong Passivity Theory (SPT). Our goal is to ultimately relax the limitation on the allowable robotic therapies while preserving system stability. The proposed stabilizing scheme does not try to make the entire non-passive component passive. This allows the therapist to have freedom in injecting energy into the system for assistive therapies while ensuring safe patient-robot interaction. In this paper, the case of telerobotic rehabilitation is considered. Experimental implementation and evaluation are presented to support the proposed theory.",

The robot is designed to actively position the patient's uterus during surgery, a lengthy and tedious task that is traditionally performed by a human assistant. Safety is simply the most important concern when developing robots for surgical purposes; we address this concern in the design of our robot from a mechanical perspective. To this end, we develop a 3-DOF robotic uterine positioner with an in-body remote center of motion (RCM); this key feature allows to prevent injuries to the patient when large motions occur at the cervix. A linearly-actuated arc-guided RCM mechanism is introduced to guarantee the rigidity and stability of the robot; The system's design allows to manipulate the uterus in a decoupled manner, thus control complexity can be reduced. Passive safety mechanisms are also implemented in all DOF of the robot in order to limit the interaction forces with the patient. Experiments, including an ex-vivo test conducted with cadaver, are conducted to verify the robot's performance.",

In contrast to most state of the art systems the two intracorporeal manipulator arms are set up using a parallel kinematic structure with 5DOF, which are integrated into a shaft of 38mm in diameter. The parallel kinematic structure and its workspace are discussed in detail. As a unique feature, the kinematics uses the translation and rotation of three rods per manipulation arm. Using a parallel kinematic approach enables dynamic, stiff and precise movements which are needed to generate a realistic haptic feedback. The results of several performed circle tests are presented showing the ability of performing precise and dynamic movements with speeds of up to 327 mm/s and under load condition of 4 N.",

        "track": "main",
        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "One of the challenging problems in human-robot shared control is the algorithms for force rendering due to uncertain human behavior. Common adaptive and optimal control techniques may not be readily applied to a number of popular haptic devices, since the required state space models are not available. In addition, the invoked control algorithms should meet the requirements of a human-in-the-loop control problem and be fast enough for such haptic applications. Thus, this paper proposes a novel combination of model predictive control (MPC) and neural networks to overcome the aforementioned problems. First, the robot is modeled by a multilayer perceptron (MLP) network. The model has been trained with a set of data created with reasonably considered all possible robot variations in a virtual environment (VE). Afterwards, an MPC is developed with the aid of artificial neural networks and genetic algorithm (GA) to find the optimized force required for a typical task model. Such optimal force calculation with the MPC approach has been carried out for a variety of reference points of a task. Then another MLP network is trained to find the optimal required forces for a reasonably fast and smooth performance. The results show the effectiveness of this approach compared to classical impedance controllers in increasing user performance.",

To provide, anywhere and anytime, smart assistance services to people, these agents need to be endowed with advanced knowledge representation, reasoning and communication capabilities. In this paper, we propose a distributed cognitive architecture allowing to integrate seamlessly the actors of the ambient system and an expressive model for commonsense knowledge representation and reasoning on events. This model allows a common description of the actors in an open world and a management of interactions with humans using natural language. A scenario dedicated to the cognitive assistance of frail people is implemented and analyzed for validation purposes of the proposed approach.",

It comprises of a flexible backbone, a set of controlling tendons and a constraint. In the CTSM not only the curvature of the bending section can be controlled but also the length. Specifically, the curvature is controlled by the tendons, and the length is controlled by a constraint tube, which is translational and is concentric with the flexible backbone. The kinematic model of the CTSM is developed based on the piecewise constant curvature assumption. Analysis shows that by introducing the translational constraint both the workspace and dexterity of the manipulator are improved. The stiffer the constraint the larger the workspace expansion and the smaller the dexterity enhancement. A prototype is developed and the experimental results validate the design idea and analysis.",

The improvement boosts performance by integrating the architecture with additional action selection methods that increase the exploratory properties of the algorithm (either soft max or e-greedy task selection). It is demonstrated empirically that the average time taken to perform rescue tasks can reduce by up to 8% and solution of some problems that baseline PI cannot handle is enabled. Comparison with the consensus-based bundle algorithm (CBBA) also shows that both the baseline PI algorithm and the enhanced versions are superior. All test problems center around a team of heterogeneous, autonomous vehicles conducting rescue missions in a 3-dimensional environment, where a number of different tasks must be carried out in order to rescue a known number of victims that is always more than the number of available vehicles.",

        "abstract": "For a robot serving in a complex environment such as in a restaurant, it is difficult to perform a task like tabletop object manipulation completely by itself, in that some information may be missing. An approach to deal with this is to use a tele-control system and method to control the robot or demonstrate. In this paper, a LeapMotion sensor based non-contact tele-control method is developed for a robot to perform tabletop object manipulation tasks. A coordinate system for mapping from the operation space of the LeapMotion sensor to the workspace of the robot is established. A gesture recognition and action generating algorithm is proposed for control or to demonstrate the motion to the robot. To evaluate the performance of the LeapMotion sensor and proposed method for tele-control of a robot, a comprehensive assessment index based on entropy weighting is proposed. Three common tele-control modes, including demonstration mode, teleoperation mode and semi-teleoperation mode, are developed on a PR2 robot. The experimental results show that the proposed tele-control system is more appropriate for use in task demonstration.",

The features of both parallel and serial kinematic mechanisms have been exploited to the aim of obtaining a device as much as possible independent from the frame to whom it is connected. Formal aspects about position and velocity kinematics are addressed and a specifically built prototype is then used for experimental tests on the new limb.",

        "abstract": "Modern robotic applications involve close contact to the human and consequently, require apart from performance a high degree of safety from their actuators. Further, the dexterous manipulation abilities of a human are not yet inherently realized by technical media. In this work a novel piezohydraulic actuator is presented aiming at a) high power density, b) human-like force/velocity characteristic, c) intrinsic passive safety and low reflected inertia, and d) high robustness. It is shown why the piezohydraulic actuation principle is appropriate to mimic the behavior of a human muscle and, as a consequence, desirable for robotic applications. A model of the actuator is also presented together with simulation and experimental results.",

        "abstract": "This paper presents a novel design for the soft continuum manipulator based on beehive structure. Our design inspiration derives from the beehive hexagon structure, which has some characteristics of compact layout, low material consumption, thinner thickness of wall, and higher structure strength. The manipulator includes several same modules which composed of many hexagon cell units, the deformation of these cell units synthesize the module macroscopic movement. By installing several modules in series, we can form the manipulator arm. For module fabrication, we adopt 3D printing technology and use the silicone rubber as the flexible material; these measures ensure that the complex shape of the module can be achieved and make the module easier to deform elastically. Based on pneumatic technology, we build the control system and verify its operation via some experiments. In the gravity environment, three-section (about 180mm long at uninflated state) manipulator's maximum bending angle reaches about 90\u00b0, its elongation is close to 2:1. We also do a five-section experiment to acquire the manipulator's motion under different section combinations. The experiments verified that the manipulator has both good flexibility and operational capabilities.",

        "abstract": "We have previously developed a five-wheeled wheelchair with an active-caster drive system. To improve motion performance of the wheelchair, we have proposed the function which two types of motions, such as rear-like drive and front-like drive mode, can be selected by using the linear actuator. In this paper, we propose a step climbing strategy and develop a mechanism. The proposed five-wheeled wheelchair has five points of contact to the ground in the stand condition. To make the front casters of the wheelchair to be hovered from the ground, a \u201cstatic wheelie\u201d configuration in which large wheels and a drive wheel touch to the ground is taken by maintaining the static stability of a wheelchair. We propose a novel and unique strategy by utilizing the statically stable wheelie configuration. Additionally, the drive wheel is lifted onto the step by cooperative control between the linear actuator and the drive wheel. We confirm that the proposed method is applicable by comparing it with a step climbing method that uses only the traction force of the drive wheel. To achieve the proposed step climbing method, we develop a novel link mechanism that can perform not only the step climbing method but also the functions mentioned above and confirm the design conditions. After the prototype is built, we confirm that a user can climb over a step by the proposed method and mechanism.",

        "abstract": "This paper presents a novel variable transmission system that is based on the concept of digital hydraulics. In the proposed system, sets of rolling-diaphragm cylinders are mounted via different effective lever arms to an input and output joint. A variable subset of these cylinders is connected via three-way two-position on/off valves to a common hydraulic manifold. This introduces a controllable constraint on the hydraulic flow and creates a programmable hydraulic transmission. With three single-acting cylinders, we could realize 37 different transmission ratios. We investigated the nonholonomic flow constraint analytically, in simulation, and with an experimental prototype. Using water as fluid, we show that a very stiff transmission (124.2 Nm/rad) can be achieved within the range of \u00b16\u00b0. Theoretical transmission ratios are tracked with R-squared values of more than 0.996 and backlash is smaller than 1.4%. Furthermore, we show the applicability of the proposed transmission in the simulation of a body-powered knee-ankle exoskeleton.",

        "abstract": "Automation of repetitive tasks can improve laparoscopic surgical procedures by unloading surgeons and reducing duration, trauma, and expense. However, surgical procedures involve delicate manipulation of deformable tissues in a very dynamic environment, suggesting that automated execution of surgical tasks should be carried out under the supervision of the surgeon. We propose a teleoperated architecture that allows a surgeon to employ and supervise agents that can autonomously perform or assist with surgical tasks. The architecture is independent of the automation method. It includes a dominance factor that allows the surgeon to take control over the slave robot at any time, and an aggressiveness factor that sets the performance pace of the autonomous agent. We tested the architecture during execution of a multilateral tension-and-cut task, where a human operator and an autonomous agent are responsible for tensioning or cutting of a tissue. The architecture allowed for supervised and paced automation of the task. We found that collaboration of the human operator and autonomous agent can lead to shorter completion time compared to performance of only a human.",

        "abstract": "We consider the problem of organizing a scattered group of n robots in two-dimensional space. The communication graph of the swarm is connected, but there is no central authority for organizing it. We want to arrange them into a sorted and equally-spaced array between the robots with lowest and highest label, while maintaining a connected communication network. In this paper, we describe a distributed method to accomplish these goals, without using central control, while also keeping time, travel distance and communication cost at a minimum. We proceed in a number of stages (leader election, initial path construction, subtree contraction, geometric straightening, and distributed sorting), none of which requires a central authority, but still accomplishes best possible parallelization. The overall arraying is performed in O(n) time, O(n2) individual messages, and O(n) travel distance per robot. Implementation of the sorting and navigation use communication messages of fixed size, and are a practical solution for large populations of low-cost robots.",

        "abstract": "This paper propose a practical and effective method for identifying the complete inertia parameters of a space robotic system. The key is the following steps: equivalent single-body identification, and equivalent two-body identification. For the former, all joints are locked into a normal configuration, and the thrusters are used for orbital maneuvering. The object function is defined from the view of acceleration and velocity. For the latter, only one joint is unlocked and driven to move along the exciting trajectory under the free-floating mode. The linear and angular momentum equations are used to define the object function. Hence, the parameter identification problem is transformed into a non-linear optimization problem, and the PSO algorithm is used to determine the optimal parameters. By sequentially unlocking the 1st to nth joint, the mass properties of body 0 to n are completely identified. The proposed method is general and can be easily extended for many cases.",

        "abstract": "Enabling human-robot collaboration raises new challenges in safety-oriented robot design and control. Indices that quantitatively describe human injury due to a human-robot collision are needed to propose suitable pre-collision control strategies. This paper presents a novel model-based injury index built on the concept of dissipated kinetic energy in a potential inelastic impact. This quantity represents the fracture energy lost when a human-robot collision occurs, modeling both clamped and unclamped cases. It depends on the robot reflected mass and velocity in the impact direction. The proposed index is expressed in analytical form suitable to be integrated in a constraint-based pre-collision control strategy. The exploited control architecture allows to perform a given robot task while simultaneously bounding our injury assessment and minimizing the reflected mass in the direction of the impact. Experiments have been performed on a lightweight robot ABB FRIDA to validate the proposed injury index as well as the pre-collision control strategy.",

        "abstract": "The state-of-the-art object pose estimation approaches represent the set of detected poses together with corresponding uncertainty. The inaccurate noisy poses may result in a configuration of overlapping objects especially in cluttered environments. Under a rigid body assumption the inter-penetrations between pairs of objects are geometrically inconsistent. In this paper, we propose the principle of minimum translation search, PROMTS, to find an inter-penetration-free configuration of the initially detected objects. The target application is to automate the task of unloading shipping containers, where a geometrically consistent configuration of objects is required for high level reasoning and manipulation. We find that the proposed approach to resolve geometrical inconsistencies improves the overall pose estimation accuracy. We examine the utility of two selected search methods: A-star and Depth-Limited search. The performance of the search algorithms are tested on data sets generated in simulation and from real-world scenarios. The results show overall improvement of the estimated poses and suggest that depth-limited search presents the best overall performance.",

        "abstract": "This paper presents a realtime locomotion mode recognition method for an active pelvis orthosis. Five locomotion modes, including sitting, standing still, level-ground walking, ascending stairs, and descending stairs, are taken into consideration. The recognition is performed with locomotion information measured by the onboard hip angle sensors and the pressure insoles. These five modes are firstly divided into static modes and dynamic modes, and the two kinds are classified by monitoring the variation of the relative hip angles of the two legs within a pre-defined period. Static states are further classified into sitting and standing still based on the absolute hip angle. As for dynamic modes, a fuzzy-logic based method is proposed for the recognition. Two event-based locomotion features, including the hip joint angle at the first foot-strike and the center of foot pressure at the first foot-strike are used to calculate the membership of different modes based on the membership function, and the mode with the maximal membership is selected as the target mode. Experimental results with three subjects achieve an average recognition accuracy of 99.87% and average recognition delay of 18.12% of one gait cycle.",

The solution algorithm is a generalized version of the standard Newton-Euler approach, running still with linear complexity O(N) but requiring to set up recursions that involve higher order derivatives of motion and force variables. Mimicking the case of rigid robots, we use this algorithm and a numerical factorization of the link inertia matrix (which needs to be inverted in the elastic joint case) for implementing on-line a feedback linearization control law for trajectory tracking purposes. The complete method has a complexity that grows as O(N3). The developed tools are generic, easy to use, and do not require symbolic Lagrangian modeling and customization, thus being of particular interest when the number N of elastic joints becomes large.",

        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "Effective and stable execution of a remote manipulation task in an uncertain environment requires that the task force and position trajectories of the slave robot be appropriately commanded. To achieve this goal, in teleimpedance control, a reference command which consists of the stiffness and position profiles of the master is computed and realized by the compliant slave robot in real-time. This highlights the need for a suitable and computationally efficient tracking of the human limb stiffness profile in real-time. In this direction, based on the observations in human neuromotor control which give evidence on the predominant use of the arm configuration in directional adjustments of the endpoint stiffness profile, and the role of muscular co-activations which contribute to a coordinated regulation of the task stiffness in all directions, we propose a novel and computationally efficient model of the arm endpoint stiffness behaviour. Real-time tracking of the human arm kinematics is achieved using an arm triangle monitored by three markers placed at the shoulder, elbow and wrist level. In addition, a co-contraction index is defined using muscular activities of a dominant antagonistic muscle pair. Calibration and identification of the model parameters are carried out experimentally, using perturbation-based arm endpoint stiffness measurements in different arm configurations and co-contraction levels of the chosen muscles. Results of this study suggest that the proposed model enables the master to naturally execute a remote task by modulating the direction of the major axes of the endpoint stiffness and its volume using arm configuration and the co-activation of the involved muscles, respectively.",

        "abstract": "In this paper, a novel repetitive control scheme is presented and discussed. The general framework is the control of repetitive tasks of robotic systems or, more in general, of automatic machines. The key idea of the proposed scheme consists in modifying the reference trajectory provided to the plant in order to compensate for external loads or unmodelled dynamics that cyclically affect it. By exploiting the dynamic filters for the B-spline trajectory planning, it has been possible to integrate the trajectory generation within a repetitive control scheme able to modify in real-time the reference signal with the aims of nullify interpolation errors. Experimental results obtained controlling two joints of a standard industrial manipulator are reported, showing the effectiveness of the proposed method.",

In this paper, we present a novel eye gaze tracker that can be integrated as a simple retrofit to the da Vinci console. In particular, the eye tracker can be used with the da Vinci Research Kit (dVRK) to control the patient side manipulators. We present the eye-tracker design and calibration. First, a 2D calibration is carried out to estimate the gaze on the da Vinci's stereoscopic display, followed by a 3D \u201chand-eye\u201d calibration to estimate the gaze in the surgical scene. Using the dVRK, we demonstrated the use of the eye-tracker to perform a gaze-assisted task, in which the estimated gaze is used as a set point for the robot and the user is guided towards the point of gaze through haptic feedback. The task performed was peg placement and was evaluated in a preliminary user study with five users.",

Communication from the fixed-position modules is one-way, allowing the system to scale to multiple robots. Furthermore, the system's high position update rate makes it suitable to be used in a feedback control system, and enables the robot to track and perform high-speed, dynamic motions. This paper describes the algorithmic underpinnings of the system, discusses design decisions and their impact on the performance of the resulting localization, and highlights challenges faced during implementation. Performance of the localization system is experimentally verified through comparison with data from a motion-capture system. Finally, the system's application to robot self-localization is demonstrated through integration with a quadrocopter.",

        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "A system for actively changing the stiffness of a long, thin, flexible robotic manipulator has been designed for cardiologists to use in a range of diagnosis and treatment procedures. Low-stiffness manipulators, such as catheters, are ideal for steering through vasculature with low risk of tissue injury. However, such instruments are not well-suited for applying force to tissue. The proposed system solves this problem by using a series of bead-shaped vertebrae containing pull wires to actively change the stiffness of the catheter, similar to gooseneck surgical retractors. Individual wires steer the catheter to a desired location. All wires are then tensioned to create friction between each vertebra and prevent sliding, therefore resisting motion. While this design concept has been implemented manually in various settings for decades, fine robotic control of the friction and stiffness of the system relies on a thorough understanding of the friction properties between vertebral segments. We have developed an analytical model to understand the interactions between vertebrae and determine the relationships between system parameters and the overall stiffness of the catheter. Experiments validated the calculations from the model and the functionality of the system by applying known loads to the tip of the catheter and measuring the catheter displacement. The catheter stiffness was measured to range from 100 N/m to 800 N/m, which is sufficient for performing many surgical tasks on tissue. This system can be useful in minimally invasive procedures involving direct instrument contact with tissue by improving accuracy, safety, and work flow.",

        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "Lack of dexterous control over the position of a catheter's distal tip and not having any feedback from the quality of tip - tissue contact are among the factors that make the conventional catheter-based method of performing cardiac ablation very challenging. To resolve these issues, in this paper, we present a robotic catheter manipulation system that accommodates a conventional ablation catheter, places the ablation tip at the desired target and reports the forces that the tip exerts on the environment in real-time. In this system, the manual proximal handle is replaced with a mechanism that is capable of measuring the tension force along the pull-wire while actuating it to flex the distal shaft of the catheter. The placement of force/pressure sensors at the distal end of the catheter is avoided by developing a model-based force estimation technique using the measured tension force and information on the position and orientation of the distal tip. The developed system is further enhanced with an interface to assist the user in placing the catheter tip at the desired location while providing him/her with a real-time measure of the contact force. Extensive experiments show that using the proposed robotic system, the catheter tip is positioned within \u00b11 mm of the designated target and contact forces are reported in real-time with an accuracy of 3 gf.",

It is difficult to calculate the accurate direction of human motion intention during manipulating an object due to discrepancy between the calculated force from F/T sensor and the real human intention. Only using an sEMG is not an adequate method of power assistance for unknown external perturbation in the anatomical multi-axis joint, because the sEMG signal cannot figure out where the intention vector exists during interactions. This paper proposes a robust control method of power-assistant robots for unknown external perturbation during manipulating an object by using both the F/T sensor and sEMG. The specific purpose of this study to control the exoskeleton robot for the wrist motion during manipulating an object, although the accurate intention vector of the wrist joint is unknown. It was verified that the proposed method generates the assisted power to follow the human motion intention even in the case of unknown external forces through experiments.",

Since possible combinations and roles of modules in the multi-robot system are defined before a mission, a gender-principle approach with one active and one passive face to be mated was chosen. The experiments in this paper are conducted to compare the improved mechanical design with the previous design. With the new design, docking is successfully tested under loads up to 800 N. The experiments presented include attaching and detaching in different EMI orientations with various loads, exceeding those expected for the application scenario.

        "track": "main",
        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "It is well known that a real-time visual servoing task which employs a Visual Tracking Algorithm (VTA) imposes high computational cost to robotic system, which consequently results in higher energy consumption and lower autonomy. Motivated by this fact, this paper presents a novel Image Based Visual Servoing-Model Predictive Control (IBVS-MPC) scheme which is combined with a mechanism that decides when the VTA needs to be triggered and new control inputs must be calculated. Between two consecutive triggering instants, the control input trajectory is applied to the robot in an openloop fashion, i.e, no visual measurements and calculation of the control inputs are required during that period. This results in the reduction of the computational effort, energy consumption and increases the autonomy of the system. These factors are of utmost importance in the case of small autonomous robotic systems which perform vision based tasks, such as surveillance and inspection of indoors and outdoors environments. The visibility and inputs constraints, optimality rate of the MPC, as well as the external disturbances, are being considered during the control design. The efficiency of the proposed scheme is demonstrated through a set of real-time experiments using an eye-in-hand mobile robotic system.",

        "abstract": "Two leading qualities of skeletal muscle that produce good performance in uncertain environments are damage tolerance and the ability to modulate impedance. For this reason, robotics researchers are greatly interested in discovering the key characteristics of muscles that give them these properties and replicating them in actuators for robotic devices. This paper describes a method to harness the redundancy present in muscle-like actuation systems composed of multiple motor units and shows that they have these same two qualities. By carefully choosing which motor units are recruited, the impedance viewed from the environment can be modulated while maintaining the same overall activation level. The degree to which the impedance can be controlled varies with total activation level and actuator length. Discretizing the actuation effort into multiple parts that work together, inspired by the way muscle fibers work in the human body, produces damage-tolerant behavior. This paper shows that this not only produces reasonably good resolutions without inordinate numbers of units, but gives the control system the ability to set the impedance along with the drive effort to the load.",

        "abstract": "This paper presents a sensorimotor contingencies (SMC) based method to fully autonomously learn to perform hand-eye coordination. We divide the task into two visuomotor subtasks, visual fixation and reaching, and implement these on a PR2 robot assuming no prior information on its kinematic model. Our contributions are three-fold: i) grounding a robot in the environment by exploiting SMCs in the action planning system, which eliminates the need for prior knowledge of the kinematic or dynamic models of the robot; ii) using a forward model to search for proper actions to solve the task by minimizing a cost function, instead of training a separate inverse model, to speed up training; iii) encoding 3D spatial positions of a target object based on the robot's joint positions, thus avoiding calibration with respect to an external coordinate system. The method is capable of learning the task of hand-eye coordination from scratch by less than 20 sensory-motor pairs that are iteratively generated at real-time speed. In order to examine the robustness of the method while dealing with nonlinear image distortions, we apply a so-called retinal mapping image deformation to the input images. Experimental results show the successfulness of the method even under considerable image deformations.",

In this paper, we present a soft-bodied jumping robot, which leverages its body's elasticity to achieve a highly dynamic passive bouncing motion after an active jumping motion. This robot has a cubic shape. It is covered by silicone foam, and each of its six faces has an opening to allow for jumping actuation. By winding up and releasing an elastic strip, the robot can jump in two directions at any orientation. We present the design, and fabrication process, and experimental results. By comparing this robot with a rigid version of the robot, we show that this soft-bodied robot can use a single jump to travel longer forward than its rigid counterpart.",

We demonstrate that combining these sensors into the same actuator enables proprioception of both actuator curvature and environmental contact forces. We describe the manufacture and integration of a simple liquid metal strain sensor, a pressure sensor, and electrical circuits used for the sensors. We derive a constant curvature model for the actuator which predicts actuator curvature from the air pressure, and other constants of manufacture. The utility of the sensor integration is demonstrated by using the actuator to distinguish successful grasps amongst a set of common cylindrical objects with varying diameter. The grasp radius is estimated from the relationship between the sensor pair. Contact forces with the environment (touch) may be inferred from sensor readings which deviate from unconstrained motion.",

This work presents a new model based control approach, the stable Extended CTC, that uses extra data from additional sensors introduced in the passive joints of parallel robot in the controller. The proposed controller guarantees asymptotic stability, which is an important contribution over the previously presented approaches. The use of redundant information increases controller robustness and performance, allowing to reduce tracking error with respect to traditional CTC approaches. The effectiveness of the proposed control law is demonstrated by implementing it in a Delta robot which has been modeled in ADAMS multibody software.",

In this paper, we propose an approach to high speed cell transfer for sorting rare cells from a small population of samples accurately using a robotic manipulation system equipped with optical tweezers. A novel switching geometrical model is established first for modeling high speed cell transfer, optical laser trapping, and obstacle avoidance based on the dynamics analysis. A normalized constraint function is designed to formulate how the trapped cell is maintained within the optical trap while avoiding obstacles. Then, a potential field based switching controller is developed, which can achieve automated cell trapping, high speed cell transfer, optical trap maintenance, and obstacle avoidance simultaneously. Finally, experiments of transferring cancer cells are performed to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.",

        "abstract": "This paper presents a systematic approach for experimental identification and assessment of mechanical effects on the dynamics of elastic actuators. The variable torsion stiffness (VTS) actuator is used as an example. As a basis for parameter identification, a flexible joint robot model considering friction and damping is used. To identify and assess occurring effects, a component-wise experimental investigation of the VTS drive train is performed. In this, influences of friction and inertia are examined using numerical least-squares regression to identify link inertia, friction in bearings, stiffness and damping in the elastic element, and the friction of gear box and actuator based on measured data. Comparing simulations to measured data, allows an evaluation of the obtained particular parameters and an assessment of their impact on overall system dynamics. Hence, the component-wise procedure enables to decide if those should be considered. This approach can be generalized to other elastic actuators by adapting model structure and/or performed experiments.",

        "abstract": "Tendon-driven continuum robots offer increased dexterity and manipulability in comparison to conventional rigid link serial manipulators. Being able to conform to complex curves in 3D space, continuum robots are in particular useful for applications in restricted and hardly accessible environments. The workspace of a tendon-driven continuum robot depends on the number of sections, as well as the length of each section and its range of bending radii. Common tendon-driven robot designs have fixed section lengths such that deployment along a tortuous paths requires additional linear translation of the whole robot. In this paper, we propose a novel tendon-driven continuum robot with extensible sections. A telescoping backbone allows control of the section length during operation in addition to bending through tendon actuation. Thus, the arc length of a section can vary and the range of bending radii is enlarged. As a result, the novel robot design inherently allows for deployment along tortuous paths in a follow-the-leader fashion. We suggest the use of spacer disks equipped with permanent magnets with alternating pole orientation. The magnetic repulsion forces enable equidistant spacing of the disks at any lengths of a robot section. We prove the concepts of our novel design with experiments using a first prototype.",

Wheeled mobile robots are able to quickly and efficiently move on flat surfaces. However they may sink into a terrain with dynamic surface such as snow, sand, dirt, moss, and small gravel. The transformable wheel robot presented in this paper is able to overcome obstacles and navigate these dynamics surfaces, yet can still move quickly over flat ground. The wheel is comprised of five spokes or legs, four of which are actively driven by a motor via four slider-crank linkages. The last one is designed be passive in order to significantly decrease the actuation force of the transformer mechanism. Analysis shows that the maximum driving force required to actuate the passive leg design is 1/187.5 times that of the active leg design. Experiments demonstrate that the passive leg design allows the mobile robot to open the transformation mechanism with a maximum external loading of 1.809 times the original robot weight. The diameter of the legged configuration wheel is 1.576 times that of the circled configuration.",

This leads to conflicting requirements for their actuators. Multiple gear ratios, like in a powertrain, address this issue by allowing an effective use of power over a wide range of output speed. However in robotics, as opposed to powertrains, the controlled load is not always inertial and acting as a low-pass filter; hence gear shifting is a more challenging issue in a robotics context. In this paper, it is proposed to address this problem using a dual-speed dual-motor architecture to maintain full control of the output during gear shifting. A dynamic model is developed and a controller using the redundancy of motors is proposed to enable fast seamless gear shifting even when interacting with unknown dynamic environments. Results are demonstrated with a proof-of-concept linear actuator.",

        "abstract": "Safety is one of the most important issues in walking support robots. We have proposed a walking support robot equipped with velocity and torque-based mechanical safety devices. The velocity-based safety device and the torque-based safety device are attached to each drive-shaft of the robot. If the velocity-based safety device detects an unexpected high angular velocity of the drive-shaft, it stops the robot. If the torque-based safety device detects an unexpected high torque of the drive-shaft, it cuts off the torque transmission and switches off all of the robot's motors. This paper proposes a new walking support robot equipped with not only the velocity-based and torque-based safety devices but also contact force-based safety devices. The contact force-based safety device stops the robot if it detects an unexpected large contact force between the robot and the environment (e.g. humans). These safety devices will work even when the computer breaks down, because they consist of only passive mechanical components without actuators, controllers, or batteries. Firstly, we describe the walking support robot with the safety devices. Secondly, we show the prototype walking support robot which we developed. Finally, we verify the effectiveness of the safety devices by experiments.",

        "abstract": "Exploiting interaction with the environment is a promising and powerful way to enhance stability of humanoid robots and robustness while executing locomotion and manipulation tasks. Recently some works have started to show advances in this direction considering humanoid locomotion with multi-contacts, but to be able to fully develop such abilities in a more autonomous way, we need to first understand and classify the variety of possible poses a humanoid robot can achieve to balance. To this end, we propose the adaptation of a successful idea widely used in the field of robot grasping to the field of humanoid balance with multi-contacts: a whole-body pose taxonomy classifying the set of whole-body robot configurations that use the environment to enhance stability. We have revised criteria of classification used to develop grasping taxonomies, focusing on structuring and simplifying the large number of possible poses the human body can adopt. We propose a taxonomy with 46 poses, containing three main categories, considering number and type of supports as well as possible transitions between poses. The taxonomy induces a classification of motion primitives based on the pose used for support, and a set of rules to store and generate new motions. We present preliminary results that apply known segmentation techniques to motion data from the KIT whole-body motion database. Using motion capture data with multi-contacts, we can identify support poses providing a segmentation that can distinguish between locomotion and manipulation parts of an action.",

        "abstract": "Modular robots are composed of many independent connected modules which are able to achieve common goals through communications. Many distributed algorithms have better performance if the modules that have to communicate with all the others, are placed at the center of the system. In this paper, we propose ABC-Center, an iterative algorithm for electing an approximate-center module in modular robots. ABC-Center uses O(1) space per module and O(kd) time, where k is the number of iterations required to terminate and d the diameter of the system. We evaluated our algorithm both on hardware modular robots and in a simulator for large ensemble of robots. The average expected eccentricity of the module elected by ABC-Center is less than 1.25 blocks off for random systems composed of up to 1000 modules. Furthermore, experiments show that our algorithm terminates after a few iterations. Hence, ABC-Center is scalable and adapted to modular robots with low memory resources.",

        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "Human-demonstrated motion transferred to a robotic platform often needs to be adapted to the current state of the environment or to modified task requirements. Adaptation, i. e. learning of a modified behavior, needs to be fast to enable quick utilization of the robot either in industry or in future household-assistant tasks. In this paper we show how to accelerate trajectory adaptation based on learning of coupling terms in the framework of dynamic movement primitives (DMPs). Our method applies ideas from feedback error learning to iterative learning control (ILC). By taking into account the actual physical constraints of the synchronous motion - through synchronization of both positions (or forces) and velocities - it is not only a more faithful representation of actual real-world processes, but it also accelerates the speed of convergence. To show the applicability of the approach in the framework of DMPs, we tested it on a formulation which encodes an initial discrete motion, followed by a periodic behavior, all in a single system. Modifications of the original discrete-periodic formulation now also allow for the use of DMP temporal scaling property. In the paper we also show how the DMP coupling can be implemented in joint space, whereas the measured forces and previous approaches always remained in the task space. We applied our approach to an example dual-arm synchronization task on Sarcos humanoid robot CB-i.",

Despite tremendous advancements in the development of innovative sensor concepts, the most effective and accurate solutions to this problem make use of a map computed from sensory data. In this paper, we present an efficient approach to localize an RGB-D smartphone or tablet that only makes use of a two-dimensional outline of the environment as a map as it is typically available from architectural drawings. Our technique employs a particle filter to estimate the 6DoF pose. We propose a sensor model that robustly estimates the likelihood of measurements and accommodates the disagreements between floor plans and real world data. In extensive experiments, we demonstrate that our approach is able to globally localize a user in a given 2D floor plan using a Google Tango device and to accurately track the user in such an environment.",

These tasks include autonomous docking and positioning as well as pick and place or logistics tasks. State-of-the-art approaches to the problem commonly assume that the environment is static and localize the robot with respect to predetermined locations. In this paper, we present an approach that relaxes the static assumption and enables a robot to accurately localize with respect to a reference object that could be moved in the environment. The core of the paper is an extension of the generalized ICP method to handle multiple rigid bodies that move independently to each others. Experiments in both simulated and real world scenarios show that our approach is able to localize the robot with respect to a moved object with an accuracy of less than one centimeter.",

This is achieved by introducing virtual constraints defining a region, in which the robot is allowed to move safely. These safety regions may change over time during human-robot interaction, which may be either due to human motion or changed environmental conditions. In consequence it is important for the applied control scheme to handle dynamic boundaries. This work proposes an invariance-based control approach, which enforces adherence to boundaries with dynamic parameters. We extend the invariance control approach, which provides a computationally efficient and systematic method for defining constraints on system states and outputs, such that it handles the constraint dynamics. Stability and invariance properties are analyzed and validated in an experimental evaluation on a 7-DoF anthropomorphic manipulator.",

Two measures of adaptability are proposed from two aspects respectively: the impact on the grasped object and the enforcement cost of the underactuated mechanism. Based on the measures, the trend of the adaptive grasping process is predicted in enveloping grasp with a simple gripper, and a corresponding experimental prototype is set up to verify the calculated results. As an application, we apply the two measures to analyze and compare the adaptability of three typical underactuated mechanisms.",

        "abstract": "In this paper, we address the positioning problem of remote centre of motion (RCM) mechanisms with uncalibrated image feedback from a monocular camera. Nowadays, RCM mechanisms are widely used in minimally invasive robotic surgery due to their ability to distally rotate a tool around a fixed entry port; note that in most surgical applications, the tools are typically controlled by manual/teleoperated motion commands given by a human user. In this paper, we depart from the traditional manual control scheme and derive sensor-based methods to automatically position the manipulated tool using real-time image feedback. To this end, we first characterise the mechanism's 3-DOF configuration with the angle of the image projected tool and scalar distances between feature points. To cope with uncertainty in the camera's calibration parameters, we propose two gradient descent estimators that adaptively compute the unknown Jacobian matrix; the stability of these algorithms is proved with Lyapunov theory. Finally, we derive a kinematic image-based controller and evaluate its performance with several positioning experiments.",

In this paper, we investigate the viability of various integration approaches (semi implicit and fully explicit first-order, fourth order Runge Kutta, and variable step first order) for maximizing computational efficiency (accuracy and stability vs. running time) on typical robotics manipulation and locomotion applications. After arguing that first-order accuracy to the dynamics models is sufficient for most manipulator and locomotion robotics applications, we focus our investigation on methods for efficient, stable dynamic simulations. We describe a novel algorithm that attempts to provide smooth convergence to the true dynamics solution, which allows us to estimate the error in kinetic energy around an integration step size (as a proxy for the simulation stability). We use this algorithm to evaluate multiple hypotheses using simulation-based experiments with two virtual robot models toward developing methods for faster dynamic simulations.",

        "abstract": "A pixel-by-pixel scanning that is usually performed by a single point-like sensor or probe is being widely used in the applications such as scanning probe microscopy techniques. Typically, their scanning time is several seconds to minutes long due to a raster scanning that needs to be conducted for capturing every single point on the surface of the sample area. To improve the scanning efficiency, recent research has been focused on investigating effective scanning patterns and methods. This work presents an adaptive local scanning method for efficiently sampling indiscrete objects like string-like one-piece connected objects under the microscopy. An initial scanning pattern is firstly investigated. Once the initial scanning reaches the object, an adaptive sinusoidal scanning method that can on-line adjust its scanning frequency and amplitude by predicting both the curvatures and the shape of the object is employed. The method also addresses scanning intersections and bifurcations associated with objects. Based on extensive implementations, it is validated that our method has high performance as it has high scanning efficiency and the scanned results match objects with high precision and high accuracy.",

Kinematics and dynamics analysis of the multi-body mechanical system are performed. Using the method of virtual decomposition, adaptive motion control laws are proposed based on rigid-body inverse dynamics with feedback compensation. Underactuation imposes second-order nonholonomic constraints on the system dynamics, which are taken into account in the control algorithm. System stability and convergence of the tracking errors are proven using a Lyapunov analysis.

To optimize the performance of motor patterns and reflexes in terms of stable locomotion on both even and uneven terrains, we present a learning scheme embedded in the B4LC system. By combining the Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) method and the Expectation-maximization based Reinforcement Learning (EM-RL) method, a learning unit is comprised of an optimization module and a learning module embedded in the hierarchical control structure. The optimization module optimizes the motor patterns at hip and ankle joints with respect to energy consumption, stability and velocity control. The learning module generates compensating torques against disturbances at the ankle joints by combining the basis function derived from state information and the policy parameters. The optimization and learning procedures are conducted on a simulated robot with 21 DoFs. The simulation results show that the robot with optimized motor patterns and learned reflexes performs a more robust and stable locomotion on even and uneven terrains.",

A set of pre-recorded images are used to express the desired trajectory, and the robot is regulated to track the desired trajectory using visual feedback. Trifocal tensor is exploited to obtain the orientation and scaled position information, which is used in the control system. Conventional methods require that there exist enough corresponding feature points in the start, current and final images, while this requirement can be easily violated in large workspace, especially for perspective cameras with limited field of view. In this paper, key frame strategy is proposed to loosen this requirement, extending the workspace of the system. Considering the unknown depth and extrinsic parameters, an adaptive controller is developed based on Lyapunov methods. Simulation results are provided to show the effectiveness of the proposed approach.",

The control strategy monitors the human-orthosis interaction torques and modifies the orthosis operation mode depending on its evolution with respect to a normal gait pattern. The control algorithm relies on the adaptation of the joints stiffness in function of these interaction torques and to the deviation from the desired trajectory. A walking pattern, an average of recorded gaits, is used as reference input. The human-orthosis interaction torques are used to define the time instant when robot assistance is needed and its degree. The objective of this work is to demonstrate the feasibility of ensuring a dynamic stability by means of an efficient real-time stiffness adaptation for multiple joints and simultaneously maintaining their synchronization. The algorithm has been tested with five healthy subjects showing its efficient behavior in maintaining the equilibrium while walking in presence of external forces. The work is performed as a preliminary study to assist patients suffering from Spinal cord injury and Stroke.",

        "abstract": "In this paper, we consider the problem of guarding a valuable naval asset from a highly maneuverable threat via the use of autonomous unmanned surface vehicles (USVs) as dynamic obstacles. The objective of the defending agent is to maximize the amount of time it takes an intruder boat to enter the restricted area. Here we introduce a set of active blocking strategies which allow the defender to influence the intruder's actions through exploitation of its obstacle avoidance. By applying a mirror transformation to the intruder's current state, a pursuit policy can be formed that always places the defender between the intruder and the asset. To apply these strategies to delayed or imperfect information environments, we present a model-predictive method of calculating defender motion goals and estimating future intruder motions. This predictive estimator is capable of generating a meta-model for the intruder's behavior and returning a probability distribution of intruder control actions based on a reduced set of observable spatial features.",

The aerial robot in this study consists of a small quadrotor platform, a robotic hand module including a gripper and slider mechanism, and an embedded vision system. Positioning of the hand is autonomously performed through a vision-based control system. In this system, position and orientation of a bar-like object is measured and detected through a monocular camera image and FPGA-based on-board processing. Through experiments, the grasping of a bar located above the robot, keeping the grasp with shut off propellers and succeeding take off by releasing a bar was achieved.",

To this purpose, a 3D-representation of the visible scenery is examined, and the subject is spatially identified by its externally viewed hull via a mesh-connection algorithm aided by visual cues, and visually identified by distinct feature tracking based on an incrementally built list of key-aspects. These two processes operate in closed-loop, and employing a set of assumptions regarding the subject's structural/temporal invariance the tracking health state can be determined. This work additionally presents the framework for the deployment of this scheme for autonomous aerial robotic subject tracking, employing the dynamic subject/environment distinction to obtain knowledge of the environment structure, and collision-free trajectory generation algorithms to achieve mobile tracking.",

We model the system and show that the attitude dynamics of each quadrotor is decoupled from the tool dynamics, so that we can consider the quadrotors as thrusters and control the tool by adjusting the orientation and magnitude of these thrusters. We also show that the 6-DOF tool dynamics could be under-actuated or fullyactuated, depending on the number of quadrotors attached to the tool and the geometric configuration of their attachments. We then design control laws for the tool-tip position/orientation tracking of the (under-actuated) tool system with two quadrotors and the (fully-actuated) tool system with three quadrotors. We use Lyapunov approach to find the desired thrust command for each quadrotor while also taking into account the spherical joint limits in a form of constrained optimization. Simulation and implementation results are performed to support the theory.",

The neuro-controller moves the robot by setting the speed of the wheels and adjusts the robot visual systems by setting the value of three parameters that determine how much of the red, green and blue components of the RGB camera images contribute in generating the network input vector. Results show that the best evolved controller can successfully drive a real robot in environments with color characteristics never encountered during evolution. Moreover, we show that the dynamic color perception abilities are based on complex patterns of activation of the three color parameters. These patterns are generated by evolved neural mechanisms that successfully adapt the robot perceptual system to the color characteristics of the different visual scenes.",

The proposed scheme consists of two control loops, one for position control and an inner one for velocity control. The gains of the controller are determined on-line, according to the position/velocity errors. Using the proposed adaptive architecture, the uncertainties in the parameters of the system are addressed and the system is able to operate when hydrodynamic disturbances are present. The complexity of the fixed gain tuning procedure is also greatly decreased for underwater vehicles when the algorithm suggested here is used. Experimental results with the Nessie VII AUV show that the adaptive controller is beneficial for underwater vehicles. Finally it is shown that the current approach reduces the energy consumption of the system.",

The latter introduces a Level of Detail (LoD) metric based on a spatial resolution in order to infer an upper bound for the amount of data that can be transmitted without violating an application specific transmission delay.

Specifically, this paper presents a bi-directional, sampling-based, asymptotically-optimal algorithm named Bi-directional FMT* (BFMT*) that extends the Fast Marching Tree (FMT*) algorithm to bi-directional search while preserving its key properties, chiefly lazy search and asymptotic optimality through convergence in probability. BFMT* performs a two-source, lazy dynamic programming recursion over a set of randomly-drawn samples, correspondingly generating two search trees: one in cost-to-come space from the initial configuration and another in cost-to-go space from the goal configuration. Numerical experiments illustrate the advantages of BFMT* over its unidirectional counterpart, as well as a number of other state-of-the-art planners.",

        "abstract": "We present a computationally efficient RGB-D based pose estimation solution for less computationally resourced MAVs, which are ideally suited as members in a swarm. Our approach applies the sufficient statistics derived for a least-squares problem to our problem context. RANSAC-based outlier detection in aligning corresponding feature points is a time consuming operation in visual pose estimation. The additive nature of the used sufficient statistics significantly reduces the computation time of the RANSAC procedure since the pose estimation in each test loop can be computed by reusing previously computed sufficient statistics. This eliminates the need for recomputing estimates from scratch each time. A simpler hypotheses testing method gave similar performance in terms of speed but less accurate than our proposed method. We further increase the efficiency by reducing the problem size to four dimensions using attitude data from an Attitude and Heading Reference System (AHRS). Using a real-world dataset, we show that our algorithm saves up to 94% of computation time for the RANSAC-based procedure in pose estimation while improving the accuracy.",

We propose a method for using multiple keyframe demonstrations to learn skills as sequences of positional constraints (c-keyframes) which can be planned between for skill execution. We also introduce an interactive GUI which can be used for displaying the learned c-keyframes to the teacher, for altering aspects of the skill after it has been taught, or for specifying a skill directly without providing kinesthetic demonstrations. We compare 3 methods of teaching c-keyframe skills: kinesthetic teaching, GUI teaching, and kinesthetic teaching followed by GUI editing of the learned skill (K-GUI teaching). Based on user evaluation, the K-GUI method of teaching is found to be the most preferred, and the GUI to be the least preferred. Kinesthetic teaching is also shown to result in more robust constraints than GUI teaching, and several use cases of K-GUI teaching are discussed to show how the GUI can be used to improve the results of kinesthetic teaching.",

        "abstract": "This paper presents a control method for walking assist with hip-mounted exoskeleton robots. For modeling a user's current walking motion, a novel finite state machine is first constructed. We divide a walking cycle uniformly using the inevitable zero crossing events. When state transitions occur, we capture the current walking spatio-temporal sensor data as discrete form. By using the sensed hip data as boundary conditions, we also develop a gait primitives based motion reconstruction method. Gait primitives are a form of basis trajectories to represent various joint motions. From those methods we estimate the moment of heel landing with interpolated knee joint motions. Utilizing the user's previous opposite step motion, we predict the positive or negative work intervals of the current step motion. This makes it possible to achieve natural \u2018one shot\u2019 assist by driving adapted torques fast. This assist strategy is also effective to enhance gait regularity. The measures of stride time variability are improved by over 30% for the simulated experiment. Various real experimentations demonstrate the feasibility of our approach.",

In the present report, we propose a novel servo recovery algorithm for NIUTS. We confirm the effectiveness of the implemented servo recovery algorithm for a real human kidney, which, as far as we know, is the first successful report of semi-autonomous servo recovery systems for lost body targets.

The proposed controller guarantees compliance of the operated manipulator strictly within preselected spatial limits. Specifically, by introducing a nonlinear stiffness term into the control design, the manipulator is prevented from colliding with an explicitly defined hard boundary, like a human being or a fragile object. When operating in spatial regions sufficiently away from the boundary the manipulator behaves as if it were operated via a linear stiffness impedance controller, thus preserving in these regions its compliance and convergence characteristics. A comparative simulation with a linear stiffness impedance controller is performed to verify and clarify the proposed approach.",

However, a small subset of these actuators alone known as McKibben pneumatic muscles with antisymmetric fiber orientations have been extensively analyzed in literature. This paper analyzes the large deformation kinematics of generalized McKibben actuators with asymmetric and arbitrarily varying fiber orientations by formulating a simple and accurate isoperimetric problem that involves constrained volume maximization problem. This model maximally decouples kinematics and kinetostatics thereby significantly reducing the numerical complexity involved in analysis. The accuracy of the model is verified by benchmarking with existing models for the McKibben actuator case, and with experiments for novel designs with no associated prior literature. This model is deemed to be useful in the design synthesis of fiber reinforced elastomeric actuators for a desired kinematic and kinetostatic requirement.",

        "abstract": "A novel method for sensing local pressure inside a microfluidic device is proposed and developed. The main advantage of the method is that the pressure can be visually seen without attaching any electrical wire or instrument. The method can also be easily integrated into applications, such as micro-robots, because of its single-layer design. The working principle is based on the deformation of Polydimethylsiloxane, a kind of polymer that is often used in microfluidic systems. The deformation in the deformation chamber causes fluid to flow in, or out, the sensing area, and consequently results in changes of color intensity in the area. As a result, the pressure can be determined based on the brightness value over the sensing area. Experimental results show a highly correlated relationship between the measured brightness and pressure with the absolute correlation of 0.986. The hysteresis and drift of the proposed sensor are investigated, and are compared with our previously proposed microbeads approach. The prototype of the proposed sensor succeeded in performing measurement on local pressure in a microfluidic device with the resolution of 3.04 kPa.",

        "abstract": "When a robotic manipulator is controlled, computing gravity force of the robot is the primary issue. Exact model parameters are not easy to be known in the practical robot system due to the uncertainty of the robot dynamics. Hence, the gravity force is presented by a combination of gravity regressor and robot dynamic parameters and is compensated by the estimation of uncertain robot dynamic parameters. Previous researches conducted estimation by using transpose of gravity regressor and full form of dynamic parameters which is not general form however this paper estimates the gravity force using the generalized gravity regressor which is regardless of the dimension and structure of the robot under the quasi-static state. Once the estimation is completed, the estimated value can be used to compute the gravitational force and control the robot. It is shown that the generalized decomposition of gravity regressor and estimation process. The results are validated through an experiment by implementing the algorithm on an upper-body dual arm robot.",

        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "Magnetic drug targeting is an approach to guide and concentrate magnetic nanoparticles (MNPs) into the diseased target organ after being injected into blood vessels. Although many works for drug targeting have been conducted, there are few studies on delivering the nanoparticles to the target region. Drug delivery performance has not been addressed sufficiently or fully. In this paper, we investigate the effect of dominant factors to MNPs delivery performance. Then, an optimized field function scheme with a pulsed magnetic actuation is proposed to significantly improve the MNPs guidance performance. With a specific condition of blood vessel size, particle size, and applied magnetic field, the optimized parameters of the field function are selected through extensive simulation studies. We find out that the optimal negative and positive time for the magnetic pulsed field mainly depends on the exit time for particles to reach the bifurcation and the critical time as the maximum time for them to reach the vessels wall, respectively. With the chosen parameters, we show that ratios of correctly guided particles in a Y-channel are reached to 100%. In addition, to minimize the power consumption, a modified field function (MFF) scheme is introduced. The MFF includes a no-power time, called zero-time, between the positive and negative time. It is shown that with the proposed MFF, the energy consumption and the heating problem of the actuator system can be significantly reduced. Therefore, the proposed guidance scheme for MNPs can overcome the sticking issue and maximize the guidance performance as well as reducing the power consumption. It should be noted that the MFF can be easily implement by programmable DC power supplies connected to electromagnetic coils.",

        "abstract": "The kinematic modelling has been applied to many controllers of under-actuated manipulators. Most of these studies assume that the control process is conducted within the workspace. However, as such a kinematic model cannot describe the situations when the stable grasping is violated in the real environment, these controllers may fail unexpectedly. In this paper, we propose a combination of kinematics based Workspace Analysis (WA) and Gaussian Process Classification (GPC) to model the success rates of control actions in the theoretical workspace. We also use the Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) to model the residual between the prediction of the WA and the ground truth data. We then apply this integrated model, Gaussian Processes enhanced Workspace Analysis (GP-WA), into an optimal controller. The optimal controller is implemented on a planar under-actuated gripper with two three-phalanx fingers. Two sets of simulation experiments are carried out to validate our method. The results demonstrate that the optimal manipulation controller based on GP-WA achieves high control accuracy for manipulating a wide range of objects.",

The lumped model has served well for early development but more descriptive models are now needed for new actuator designs and control approaches. In this paper we propose a new unlumped model specifically for linear series elastic actuators which uses a rack & pinion conceptualization to intuitively depict the mechanics of a linear ball screw drive. Results from hardware experiments are presented and compared to the predicted simulation results for both the conventional model and the new unlumped model. The results demonstrate that the new unlumped model is significantly more representative of the true actuator dynamics.",

        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "Methods from machine learning have successfully been used to improve the performance of control systems in cases when accurate models of the system or the environment are not available. These methods require the use of data generated from physical trials. Transfer Learning (TL) allows for this data to come from a different, similar system. This paper studies a simplified TL scenario with the goal of understanding in which cases a simple, alignment-based transfer of data is possible and beneficial. Two linear, time-invariant (LTI), single-input, single-output systems are tasked to follow the same reference signal. A scalar, LTI transformation is applied to the output from a source system to align with the output from a target system. An upper bound on the 2-norm of the transformation error is derived for a large set of reference signals and is minimized with respect to the transformation scalar. Analysis shows that the minimized error bound is reduced for systems with poles that lie close to each other (that is, for systems with similar response times). This criterion is relaxed for systems with poles that have a larger negative real part (that is, for stable systems with fast response), meaning that poles can be further apart for the same minimized error bound. Additionally, numerical results show that using the reference signal as input to the transformation reduces the minimized bound further.",

In this paper, a sEMG recognition method which is applicable to multi-users is proposed. Firstly, single channel sEMG is decomposed into 30 MUAPTs, which includes four steps: two-order differential filter, threshold calculation, spike detection and hierarchical clustering. Secondly, the MUAPTs are updated with the templates orthogonalization; and Deep Boltzman Machine is employed to classify the MUAPTs into five classes corresponding to the predefined five gestures. Six participants participated in this experiment to validate the effectiveness of the proposed method. Results indicated that this method can achieve a mean accuracy of 81.5%.",

The robot system is composed of a hybrid parallel kinematic machine and 2 KUKA LWR arms and is dedicated to awake surgery with head motion compensation. The target accuracy is sub-millimeter. Calibration errors are known to cumulate along the kinematic loops in the system, so a method of volumetric compensation of inaccuracies is applied. Configuration-dependent compensation homogeneous transforms populate a look-up table trained offline for a set of discrete subregions of the workspace. At runtime, the compensation is applied to the robot motion so to reach an end-to-end static accuracy distributed with a median 0.75 mm and below 1 mm for the 95% of tests, with a 1\u223636 reduction factor from the default calibration conditions.",

        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "This paper presents a novel control architecture for controlling a moving remote center of motion in addition to the end-effector motion during robotic surgery. In minimally invasive surgery, it is common to require that the point at which the robot enters the body, called the incision point or the trocar, does not allow for any lateral motion. It is generally considered that no motion should be applied to this point in order to avoid inflicting damage to the patient's skin. However, in surgery, the patient's body may be moving, for example due to breathing or the beating of the heart. In order to compensate for this motion\u2014or if we for some other reason want to leverage the possible motion of the incision point to improve performance in any other way\u2014we derive a new framework which allows us to actively control the motion both at the incision point and the end effector. The novelty of the approach lies in the possibility of controlling both the incision point and the end effector to follow a trajectory, and that we find a Jacobian matrix that satisfies the velocity constraints in both the end-effector and the incision point frames. This allows us to formulate a framework that is not only suited for control, but also for analyzing the condition number of the Jacobian and avoid any singular configurations that may arise either as a result of the constrained motion or the manipulator geometry. The approach is verified experimentally on a redundant industrial manipulator.",

A step further, the principia of configuration design and gait planning were proposed based on dynamic analysis. The prototype was developed and the climbing forces experiment was carried out. We testified the rationality of GPL model and waist trajectory planning. Also, energy analysis was proven by the driving forces measured on the supporting feet. In our experiment, the deceleration force during the robot climbing was only provided by the gravity, indicating a potential space for speed improvement without significant energy waste.",

        "abstract": "We study the problem in which a mobile sensing robot is tasked to travel among and gather intelligence at a set of spatially distributed points-of-interest (POIs). The quality of the information collected at a POI is characterized by some sensory (reward) function of time. With limited fuel, the robot must balance between spending time traveling to more POIs and performing time-consuming sensing activities at POIs to maximize the overall reward. In a dual formulation, the robot is required to acquire a minimum amount of reward with the least amount of time. We propose an anytime planning algorithm for solving these two NP-hard problems to arbitrary precision for arbitrary reward functions. The algorithm is effective on large instances with tens to hundreds of POIs, as demonstrated with an extensive set of computational experiments. Besides mobile sensor scheduling, our algorithm also applies to automation scenarios such as intelligent and optimal itinerary planning.",

More specifically, the first three hidden layers of this architecture utilize Sigmoid function to produce their respective intermediate outputs. On the other hand, the last hidden layer uses a linear transformation to generate the final output of this architecture. This transforms our deep network architecture from a classifier to a non-linear regression model. We compare the performance of our deep network with a selected number of results in the literature to show a considerable improvement in reducing the errors in estimation of these values. Furthermore, we show its scalability on estimating the weld bead parameters with same level of accuracy on combination of datasets that pertain to different welding techniques. This is a nontrivial result that is counter-intuitive to the general belief in this field of research.",

This approach combines class-conditional probabilities from supervised learning models and incorporates past inferences. In this work, several experiments on multi-class semantic place classification are reported based on publicly available datasets. Such experiments were conducted in a such way that generalization aspects are emphasized, which is particularly important in real-world applications.

We address a problem where given demonstrations are not directly applicable to reward function estimation due to the non-stationarity of an environment or the difference between the dynamics of a robot and a demonstrator. A basic idea of the proposed method is to use a subset of the trajectories sampled from the baseline policy as training data for inverse reinforcement learning. All consistent sample trajectories and inconsistent demonstrations are abstracted by an affine transformation invariant feature. Using the feature, the importance of each sample trajectory is estimated. Rating the sample trajectories based on importance, the training data for inverse reinforcement learning are identified. The validity of our approach is verified through simulation in two scenarios: inconsistency caused by variation of an environment and performance of a robot.",

        "abstract": "Mobile robots are nowadays used in a wide variety of missions especially for exploring environments and allowing scientists who study these environments to gather data about them. However the monolithic design of control laws is often a hindrance to adapting control solutions from a robotic application to another. We thus propose a new control description paradigm strongly focused on modularity as well as integrating constraints coming both from the system capabilities and from the concerns of control engineering (such as stability). In this paper, we present the main ideas behind our approach and illustrate it through Hardware-In-the-Loop simulation.",

        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "In recent years there has been increased interest in studies that explore integrative learning of language and other modalities by using neural network models. However, for practical application to human-robot interaction, the acquired semantic structure between language and meaning has to be available immediately and repeatably whenever necessary, just as in everyday communication. As a solution to this problem, this study proposes a method in which a recurrent neural network self-organizes cyclic attractors that reflect semantic structure and represent interaction flows in its internal dynamics. To evaluate this method we design a simple task in which a human verbally directs a robot, which responds appropriately. Training the network with training data that represent the interaction series, the cyclic attractors that reflect the semantic structure is self-organized. The network first receives a verbal direction, and its internal state moves according to the first half of the cyclic attractors with branch structures corresponding to semantics. After that, the internal state reaches a potential to generate appropriate behavior. Finally, the internal state moves to the second half and converges on the initial point of the cycle while generating the appropriate behavior. By self-organizing such an internal structure in its forward dynamics, the model achieves immediate and repeatable response to linguistic directions. Furthermore, the network self-organizes a fixed-point attractor, and so able to wait for directions. It can thus repeat the interaction flexibly without explicit turn-taking signs.",

In particular, books in public libraries are frequently borrowed and returned, even misplaced, and proves a challenge to be tracked on a daily basis. To track the books efficiently, we propose the Autonomous Robotic Shelf Scanning (AuRoSS) system. This paper elaborates on the key enabling robotic technology for the fully autonomous system, namely, a navigation system with surface tracking capability. A Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) reader is carried by the navigation system to identify the RFID tags embedded in each book. Based on the tag information, a tracking report that highlights missing and misplaced books is generated for the end users. To ensure successful identification, the surface tracking requires high accuracy, for which we propose a filtered Hough transform and a macro-mini manipulator structure. Tests of the AuRoSS system in a library show high accuracy in the scanning performance.",

        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "This paper presents an audio-visual beat-tracking method for an entertainment robot that can dance in synchronization with music and human dancers. Conventional music robots have focused on either music audio signals or dancing movements of humans for detecting and predicting beat times in real time. Since a robot needs to record music audio signals by using its own microphones, however, the signals are severely contaminated with loud environmental noise and reverberant sounds. Moreover, it is difficult to visually detect beat times from real complicated dancing movements that exhibit weaker repetitive characteristics than music audio signals do. To solve these problems, we propose a state-space model that integrates both audio and visual information in a probabilistic manner. At each frame, the method extracts acoustic features (audio tempos and onset likelihoods) from music audio signals and extracts skeleton features from movements of a human dancer. The current tempo and the next beat time are then estimated from those observed features by using a particle filter. Experimental results showed that the proposed multi-modal method using a depth sensor (Kinect) for extracting skeleton features outperformed conventional mono-modal methods by 0.20 (F measure) in terms of beat-tracking accuracy in a noisy and reverberant environment.",

        "abstract": "This paper addresses multimodal \u201cscene understanding\u201d for a robot using audio-visual and text information. Scene understanding is defined by extracting six-W information such as What, When, Where, Who, Why, and hoW on the surrounding environment. Although scene understanding for a robot has been studied in the fields of robot vision and audition, only the first four Ws except for why and how information were considered. We, thus, focus on extracting how information, in particular, on cooking scenes. In cooking scenes, we define how information as a cooking procedure, and it is useful that a robot gives appropriate advice for cooking. To realize such cooking support, we propose a multi-modal cooking procedure recognition framework consisting of Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), and Hierarchical Hidden Markov Model (HHMM). CNN is knows as one of the most advanced classifiers, and it is applied to recognize a cooking events from audio and visual information. HHMM models a cooking procedure represented by a sequence of cooking events, which is defined as a relationship between cooking events using text data obtained from web, and the cooking events classified with CNN. Therefore, our proposed framework integrates these three types of modalities. We constructed an interactive cooking support system based on the proposed framework, which advice a next step in the current cooking procedure through human-robot communication. Preliminary results with simulated and real recorded multi-modal scenes showed the robustness of the proposed framework in a noisy and/or occluded situation.",

We propose a solution to this problem which allows us to project textured objects to the image in real-time (up to 20 fps): projection of 3D segments to the image; occlusions; and illumination. In addition, since we are considering that the imaging device is on a mobile robot, one needs to take into account the real-time localization of the robot. To the best of our knowledge this is the first time that this problem is addressed (all state-of-the-art methods are derived for central camera systems).

        "abstract": "This paper reports on an algorithm to support autonomous vehicles in reasoning about occluded regions of their environment to make safe, reliable decisions. In autonomous driving scenarios, other traffic participants are often occluded from sensor measurements by buildings or large vehicles like buses or trucks, which makes tracking dynamic objects challenging.We present a method to augment standard dynamic object trackers with means to 1) estimate the occluded state of other traffic agents and 2) robustly associate the occluded estimates with new observations after the tracked object reenters the visible region of the sensor horizon. We perform occluded state estimation using a dynamics model that accounts for the driving behavior of traffic agents and a hybrid Gaussian mixture model (hGMM) to capture multiple hypotheses over discrete behavior, such as driving along different lanes or turning left or right at an intersection. Upon new observations, we associate them to existing estimates in terms of the Kullback-Leibler divergence (KLD). We evaluate the proposed method in simulation and using a real-world traffic-tracking dataset from an autonomous vehicle platform. Results show that our method can handle significantly prolonged occlusions when compared to a standard dynamic object tracking system.",

        "abstract": "We present a novel, soft, tactile skin composed of a fabric-based, stretchable sensor technology based on the piezoresistive effect. Softness is achieved by a combination of a soft silicone padding covered by a skin of more durable, tearproof silicone with an imprinted surface pattern mimicking human glabrous skin, found e.g. in fingertips. Its very thin layer structure (starting from 2.5 mm) facilitates integration on existing robot surfaces, particularly on small and highly curved links. For example, we augmented our Shadow Dexterous Hand with 12 palm sensors, and 2 resp. 3 sensors in the middle resp. proximal phalanges of each finger. To demonstrate the usefulness and efficiency of the proposed sensor skin, we performed a challenging classification task distinguishing squeezed objects based on their varying stiffness.",

These bubbles conduct a regular rising movement, which is utilized to assemble the 2D ring-shaped microgels fabricated in a simple micro fluidic device. With this novel bubble-based method and the robotic system, we achieve the automation of the assembly. A 1.2 mm long vascular-like microtube with an outer diameter of 200 \u00b5m is fabricated. The whole process of the bubble-based assembly is visually observed and analyzed with side view. Key parameters are characterized to improve the assembly. Results show that the automated bubble-based assembly success rate is 100% and average time cost of assembling every microgel is as low as 3.25s.",

This is a challenging task due to the three-dimensional, heterogeneous and complex morphology of the fiber bonds. The goal is to automatically grasp the fiber bond, and break it by pulling apart the fibers it consists of. We present the components of the microrobotic platform, and the different rules utilized in detecting suitable grasp points from a 3D reconstruction of the bond generated from an image pair. We demonstrate the functionality of the approach with bond breaking experiments of seven fiber bonds. The time required for grasping and breaking of a bond is 10 - 15 seconds making the approach much faster than the current state-of-the-art testing, which is based on manual manipulation. The success rate of the tests is as high as 80 %.",

        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "We present an approach that uses combinatorial optimization to decide which spatial relations between objects are relevant to accurately describe an indoor scene, made up of objects. We extract scene models from object configurations that are acquired during demonstration of actions, characteristic for a certain scene. We model scenes as graphs with Implicit Shape Models (ISMs), a Generalized Hough Transform variant. ISMs are limited to represent scenes as star-shaped topologies of object relations, leading to false positives in recognizing scenes. To describe other relation topologies, we introduced a representation of trees of ISMs in prior work together with a method to learn such ISM trees from demonstrations. Limited to creating topologies, corresponding to spanning trees, that method omits certain relations so that false positives still occur. In this paper, we introduce a method to convert any relation topology, corresponding to a connected graph, into an ISM tree using a heuristic depth-first-search. It allows using complete graphs as scene models. Despite causing no false positives, complete graphs are intractable for scene recognition. To achieve efficiency, we contribute a method that searches for an optimal relation topology by traversing the space of connected scene graphs, for a given set of objects, using an optimization similar to hill climbing. Optimality is defined as minimizing computational costs during scene recognition, while producing a minimum of false positives. Experiments with up to 15 objects show that both are achievable by the presented method. Costs, growing exponentially with the number of objects, are transferred from online recognition to offline optimization.",

        "abstract": "We address the problem of controlling modular robot manipulators. The challenge of modular-robot control is that the overall system dynamics are unknown due to its flexible composition from given modules. Most previous work has faced this problem by designing decentralized controllers. Simple decentralized controllers do not guarantee global asymptotic stability without knowledge of the overall system dynamics and alternative versions involving communication with neighboring modules result in complicated control concepts. Our approach is completely different: we store parameters regarding the dynamics and kinematics of each module and a unique identification number in itself. After finishing the assembly of the modules, the parameters are gathered in a central controller, which also detects the configuration using the identification numbers. Our centralized controller uses this information to synthesize model-based control laws on-the-fly as if the full system dynamics are known beforehand. We introduce a novel and compact notation to automate this procedure and to generalize the derivation of the kinematic and dynamic model for heterogeneous modules. Finally, a possible application is shown using simulations.",

As the complexity of the task increases it becomes increasingly unlikely that tasks can always be executed without errors. Preventing errors beyond a certain point is economically infeasible, in particular for small-batch productions. As an alternative, we propose a system for automatically handling certain classes of errors instead of preventing them. Specifically, we show that many operations can be automatically reversed. Errors can be handled through automatic reverse execution of the control program to a safe point, from which forward execution can be resumed. This paper describes the principles behind automatic reversal of robotic assembly operations, and experimentally demonstrates the use of a domain-specific language that supports automatic error handling through reverse execution. Our contribution represents the first experimental demonstration of reversible computing principles applied to industrial robotics.",

Due to the constraints imposed by millimeter-sized overall diameter, the designs of laser ablation end effectors are challenging. In this paper, a laser ablation end effector for minimally invasive surgery is designed and built. The proposed end effector is composed of a bending section, a ball joint mechanism and a micro imaging sensor. By actuating the bending section and the ball joint mechanism independently, the Nd:YAG laser beam with the wavelength of 1064nm is steered to desired directions within its workspace and irradiate target lesion points. The diameter of the laser ablating distal module is 5 millimeters and the maximal tilt angle of the ball joint mechanism is 26 degrees. Furthermore, based on the proposed end effector and auxiliary mechanical system, an autonomous laser ablating approach is established to coagulate lesion. This method is developed on a lesion's planar contour which is obtained by the small image sensor, and the coordinates of all planned ablating positions are calculated, satisfying that all lesion area are covered. The laser ablating method is verified by experiments.",

        "abstract": "In recent years, several low-cost 3D laser scanners are being brought to the market and 3D laser scanning is becoming widely used in many fields. For example, 3D modeling of architectural structures or digital preservation of cultural heritages are typical applications for 3D laser scanning. Despite of the development of light-weight and high-speed laser scanners, however, the complicated measurement procedure and long measurement time are still a heavy burden for the widespread use of laser scanning. We have proposed a robotic 3D scanning system using multiple robots named CPS-SLAM, which consists of parent robots with a 3D laser scanner and child robots with target markers. In this system, a large-scale 3D model can be acquired by an on-board 3D laser scanner on a parent robot from several positions determined precisely by the localization technique using multiple robots named Cooperative Positioning System, CPS. Therefore, this system enables to build a 3D model without complicated post-processing procedures such as ICP. In addition, this system is an open-loop SLAM system and a quite precise 3D model can be obtained without closed loops. This paper proposes an automatic planning technique of a laser measurement for CPS-SLAM. By planning a proper scanning strategy depending on a target structure, it is possible to perform laser scanning efficiently and accurately even for a large-scale and complex environment. Proposed technique plans an efficient scanning strategy automatically by taking account of several criteria, such as visibility between robots, error accumulation, and efficient traveling. We conducted computer simulations and outdoor experiments to verify the performance of the proposed technique.",

        "abstract": "Underwater environments present a considerable challenge for computer vision, since water is a scattering medium with substantial light absorption characteristics which is made even more severe by turbidity. This poses significant problems for visual underwater navigation, object detection, tracking and recognition. Previous works tackle the problem by using unreliable priors or expensive and complex devices. This paper adopts a physical underwater light attenuation model which is used to enhance the quality of images and enable the applicability of traditional computer vision techniques images acquired from underwater scenes. The proposed method simultaneously estimates the attenuation parameter of the medium and the depth map of the scene to compute the image irradiance thus reducing the effect of the medium in the images. Our approach is based on a novel optical flow method, which is capable of dealing with scattering media, and a new technique that robustly estimates the medium parameters. Combined with structure-from-motion techniques, the depth map is estimated and a model-based restoration is performed. The method was tested both with simulated and real sequences of images. The experimental images were acquired with a camera mounted on a Remotely Operated Vehicle (ROV) navigating in a naturally lit, shallow seawater. The results show that the proposed technique allows for substantial restoration of the images, thereby improving the ability to identify and match features, which in turn is an essential step for other computer vision algorithms such as object detection and tracking, and autonomous navigation.",

        "abstract": "Robotic systems typically have numerous parameters, e.g. the choice of planning algorithm, real-valued parameters of motion and vision modules, and control parameters. We consider the problem of optimizing these parameters for best worst-case performance over a range of environments. To this end we first propose to evaluate system parameters by adversarially optimizing over environment parameters to find particularly hard environments. This is then nested in a game-theoretic minimax optimization setting, where an outerloop aims to find best worst-case system parameters. For both optimization levels we use Bayesian global optimization (GP-UCB) which provides the necessary confidence bounds to handle the stochasticity of the performance. We compare our method (Nested Minimax) with an existing relaxation method we adapted to become applicable in our setting. By construction our approach provides more robustness to performance stochasticity. We demonstrate the method for planning algorithm selection on a pick'n'place application and for control parameter optimization on a triple inverted pendulum for robustness to adversarial perturbations.",

        "abstract": "Wheelchairs play an important role for people living with locomotor impairments. However, power wheelchair users frequently report both minor and major accidents. The goal of this paper is to advocate for the use of robotic technology, in particular sensor-based detection and automatic classification of activities, to track and characterize activities onboard smart wheelchairs. Experiments were conducted in a clinical setting, in which experienced wheelchair users were asked to conduct a set of typical wheelchair activities. This paper presents an end-to-end pipeline for accurately classifying these activities from accelerometer data using signal processing and machine learning methods. Our classifier achieved an overall accuracy of around 50% in a more than 25 classes classification problem, compared to less than 4% with a random classifier. We also explored the possibility of discovering hidden patterns of activities using unsupervised topic modeling methods. We demonstrated the power of the inferred patterns with two use cases, namely story telling and hazard discovery. Altogether, this work provides new tools for characterizing the usage of smart wheelchairs with typical users.",

        "abstract": "The continuously growing need for increasing the production of food and reducing the degradation of water supplies, has led to the development of several precision agriculture systems over the past decade so as to meet the needs of modern societies. The present study describes a methodology for the detection and characterization of Nitrogen (N) deficiencies in corn fields. Current methods of field surveillance are either completed manually or with the assistance of satellite imaging, which offer infrequent and costly information to the farmers about the state of their fields. The proposed methodology promotes the use of small-scale Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) and Computer Vision algorithms that operate with information in the visual (RGB) spectrum. Through this implementation, a lower cost solution for identifying N deficiencies is promoted. We provide extensive results on the use of commercial RGB sensors for delivering the essential information to farmers regarding the condition of their field, targeting the reduction of N fertilizers and the increase of the crop performance. Data is first collected by a UAV that hovers over a stressed area and collects high resolution RGB images at a low altitude. A recommendation algorithm identifies potential segments of the images that are candidates exhibiting N deficiency. Based on the feedback from experts in the area a training set is constructed utilizing the initial suggestions of the recommendation algorithm. Supervised learning methods are then used to characterize crop leaves that exhibit signs of N deficiency. The performance of 84.2% strongly supports the potential of this scheme to identify N-deficient leaves even in the case of images where the unhealthy leaves are heavily occluded by other healthy or stressed leaves.",

The golf cars were designed to be robust, reliable, and safe, while operating under prolonged durations. Considerations that went in to the overall system design included the fact that any member of the public had to not only be able to easily use the system, but to also not have the option to use the system in an unintended manner. This paper details the hardware and software components of the golf cars with these considerations, and also how the booking system and mission planner facilitated users to book for a golf car from any of ten stations within the gardens. We show that the vehicles performed robustly throughout the prolonged operations with a small localization variance, and that users were very receptive from the user survey results.",

        "abstract": "In an effort to improve sailor safety during underway replenishment on the open sea, a robotic refueling system has been developed to autonomously refuel unmanned surface vehicles (USVs). The Rapid Autonomous Fuel Transfer (RAFT) project has demonstrated a methodology that could be used on the open water to autonomously refuel Navy vessels at significant sea states. The prototype refueling system is made up of two robotic arms: a rigid and precise industrial robotic manipulator to pinpoint the location of the target fuel tank and a novel soft pneumatic arm (Octarm) to provide compliant and safe contact with the USV. At the end of the Octarm, a magnetic end effector was designed (patent pending) to transfer a refueling \u201cpuck\u201d from the robotic system to the target fuel tank. Acting under manual control or autonomously through visual tracking techniques, the robotic refueling system was shown to effectively transfer fuel to the target US Navy Sea Fox vessel under sea state 3.25 conditions at the US Army Aberdeen Test Center. The results demonstrate the feasibility of using a robotic solution to allow autonomous shore-to-ship or ship-to-USV refueling. It also illustrates the benefits and challenges of future robotic ship-to-USV refueling operations. This represents the first demonstrated use of a robotic system for fluid transfer to vessels in active sea states. This paper describes the design, development, and demonstration of the prototype autonomous refueling system.",

Both choices are forbidden on Micro Aerial Vehicles (MAV) due to limited payload and computational power. However, an appropriate choice of the hardware sensor equipment allows the employment of mixed multi-spectral analysis and computer vision techniques to identify natural landmarks. In this work, we propose a low-cost low-weight camera array with appropriate optical filters to be exploited both as stereo camera and multi-spectral sensor. Through stereo vision and the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), we are able to classify the observed materials in the scene among several different classes, identify vegetation and water bodies and provide measurements of their relative bearing and distance from the robot. A handheld prototype of this camera array is tested in outdoor environment.",

        "abstract": "Manipulation tasks involving sequential pick-and-place actions in human environments remains an open problem for robotics. Central to this problem is the inability for robots to perceive in cluttered environments, where objects are physically touching, stacked, or occluded from the view. Such physical interactions currently prevent robots from distinguishing individual objects such that goal-directed reasoning over sequences of pick-and-place actions can be performed. Addressing this problem, we introduce the Axiomatic Particle Filter (APF) as a method for axiomatic state estimation to simultaneously perceive objects in clutter and perform sequential reasoning for manipulation. The APF estimates state as a scene graph, consisting of symbolic spatial relations between objects in the robot's world. Assuming known object geometries, the APF is able to infer a distribution over possible scene graphs of the robot's world and produce the maximally likely state estimate of each object's pose and spatial relationships between objects. We present experimental results using the APF to infer scene graphs from depth images of scenes with objects that are touching, stacked, and occluded.",

We propose a binary quantization method that converts a real valued vector to a binary vector. We apply this method on a state-of-the-art 3D feature descriptor, SHOT [1], and create a new binary 3D feature descriptor. B-SHOT requires 32 times lesser memory for its representation while being 6 times faster in feature descriptor matching, when compared to the SHOT feature descriptor. Experimental evaluation shows that B-SHOT offers comparable keypoint matching performance to that of the state-of-the-art 3D feature descriptors on a standard benchmark dataset.",

        "abstract": "This paper presents a trajectory tracking control strategy based on the subspace stabilization approach to accurately manipulate an under-actuated flying robot from a known initial state to the desired terminal state. To facilitate the development of this tracking strategy, the dynamical model of the quadrotor is firstly proposed. Subsequently, an optimal trajectory generation algorithm is adopted to generate dynamically consistent trajectories regarding the initial and terminal state constraints in specific missions. Then, a trajectory tracking control strategy based on the subspace stabilization approach is developed considering the lumped disturbances and time delays. The developed control strategy is applied for ball juggling of a highly under-actuated quadrotor, which is a popular flying robot in recent years. Real-time experimental results show that the quadrotor can be accurately manipulated from a known initial state to the desired terminal state within a given time horizon. In the consecutive juggling tasks, the quadrotor with a racket of radius 0.065 m can consecutively juggle the ball for averagely 4 hits in each rally, and a longest rally achieved by the developed control strategy is 14 hits. The feasibility of the developed control strategy is also preliminarily verified through the cooperative juggling between two quadrotors. All of these results demonstrate the effectiveness of the developed control strategy.",

We are interested in context, in the form of the behavioural intent of an agent, for enhanced trajectory prediction. We present a Bayesian framework that estimates both the intended goal destination and future trajectory of a mobile agent moving among multiple static obstacles. Our method is based on multi-modal hypotheses of the intended goal, and is focused primarily on the long-term trajectory of the agent. We propose a computationally efficient solution and demonstrate its behaviour in a pedestrian scenario with a real-world data set. Results show the benefits of our method in comparison to traditional trajectory prediction methods and illustrate the feasibility of integration with higher-level planning algorithms.",

        "abstract": "This paper reports on the inclusion of a probabilistic channel model within a cooperative localization planning framework. Underwater cooperative localization reduces positioning errors by sharing sensor data across a team of underwater vehicles. Relative range constraints between vehicles are measured by the one-way-travel-time of successfully received acoustic communication broadcasts. The quality of the navigation solution is intimately linked to the geometry of the network and, therefore, can benefit from planning informative relative trajectories. We cast this planning problem as an instance of belief space planning. In order to weight packet loss over the acoustic channel, we introduce a probabilistic channel model into the planning framework. We propose an optimization algorithm that allows us to plan open-loop control actions and, by extension, closed-loop parameterized trajectories.",

In 2014, the league added a new sub-competition which serves as a testbed for cooperation without pre-coordination: the Drop-in Player Competition. Instead of homogeneous robot teams that are each programmed by the same people and hence implicitly pre-coordinated, this competition features ad hoc teams, i. e. teams that consist of robots originating from different RoboCup teams and that are each running different software. In this paper, we provide an overview of this competition, including its motivation and rules. We then present and analyze the results of the 2014 competition, which gathered robots from 23 teams, involved at least 50 human participants, and consisted of fifteen 20-minute games for a total playing time of 300 minutes. We also suggest improvements for future iterations, many of which will be evaluated at RoboCup 2015.",

To preserve safe distance from obstacles and at the same time suggest the user a preferred direction to progress along the path, the virtual fixtures are generated by arbitrarily redirecting assistive forces obtained by summation of attractive and repulsive potential fields. The main result of the paper is the definition of a passivity preserving condition for this redirection, so that the behavior of the teleoperated systems remains safe and stable. The proposed assisted mode of teleoperation has been tested on a surgical robot prototype with dual arms configuration, since robotic surgery represents a suitable application domain for such control schemes.",

The fabrication process is carried out using a single mask and a combination of cleanroom and regular lab room processing. The processing resulted in successful realization of 6.4 mm long sensors with high yield. Associated signal conditioning circuitry was developed to extract small variations in resistance due to flow while suppressing noise. Three sensors were deployed on a fuselage shaped structure and characterized in a wind tunnel. Static linear and nonlinear estimation schemes were obtained based on the characterization data to determine the angle of attack, sideslip angle and airspeed values. For small angles of perturbation, the estimation scheme demonstrated good accuracy in determining the variables of interest. The sensors along with the signal conditioning circuitry are sufficiently lightweight that they can be used for estimating velocity states on micro air vehicles.",

However, these two tasks are potentially complementary, (i) scene and pose priors can benefit text spotting, and (ii) the ability to identify and associate text features can benefit navigation accuracy through loop closures. Previous approaches to autonomous text spotting typically require significant training data and are too slow for real-time implementation. In this work, we propose a novel high-level feature descriptor, the \u201cjunction\u201d, which is particularly well-suited to text representation and is also fast to compute. We show that we are able to improve SLAM through text spotting on datasets collected with a Google Tango, illustrating how location priors enable improved loop closure with text features.",

It presents a probabilistic localization system that generates an appropriate observation model online, unlike existing systems which require pre-determined belief models. This paper proposes that probabilistic visual localization requires two major operating modes - one to match locations under similar conditions and the other to match locations under different conditions. We develop dual observation likelihood models to suit these two different states, along with a similarity measure-based method that identifies the current conditions and switches between the models. The system is experimentally tested against different types of ongoing appearance change. The results demonstrate that the system is compatible with a wide range of visual front-ends, and the dual-model system outperforms a single-model or pre-trained approach and state-of-the-art localization techniques.",

        "abstract": "In this paper, we propose a novel approach to generate a temporal consistent semantic map for 3D indoor scenes. In contrast to previous techniques which generate the semantic map on the whole global scene immediately or smooth the semantic predictions by a graph model, we intend to discover temporal information over RGB-D images and leverage it to enforce the label consistency. Our method contains two key components: a low-level component and a high-level component. On the low level, temporal segmentation method is adopted to find the correspondence of the superpixels incrementally. On the high level, temporal information is treated as the higher order cliques and a higher-order Dense Conditional Random Fields (CRF) is utilized to jointly infer the object category and structural class of the global point cloud. On the experiments, we compare our temporal consistent segmentation algorithm with the state-of-the-art approach and generate the semantic maps from the NYU v2 dataset. Our experiments demonstrate that temporal consistent constraints are significant for the semantic mapping procedure and can improve the precision of the semantic mapping results.",

The motion prediction for the target vessel is based on Monte-Carlo sampling of dynamically feasible and collision-free paths with fuzzy weights, leading to a predicted path resembling anthropomorphic driving behavior. This prediction is continuously optimized for a particular target by learning the necessary parameters for a 3-degree-of-freedom model of the vessel and its maneuvering behavior from its path history without any prior knowledge. The path planning for the USV with COLREGS is achieved on a grid-based map in a single stage by incorporating A* path planning with Artificial Terrain Costs for dynamically changing obstacles. Various scenarios for interaction, including multiple civilian and adversarial vessels, are handled by the planner with ease. The effectiveness of the algorithms has been demonstrated both in representative simulations and on-water experiments.",

        "abstract": "A novel Kalman filter to estimate the center of mass (COM) of a Humanoid robot is proposed. In the conventional works, COM was estimated by some methods. First one is the kinematics computation based on the mass property of the robot and the global position and attitude of the body frame, but those errors degrade the estimation accuracy. Second is the double integral of COM acceleration computed by the measured external force. However, its accuracy suffers from the error accumulation with the integration and the initial error remains. Third is based on the relationship between COM and the zero-moment point (ZMP), but it ignores the torque around COM. Additionally, it only dealt with the horizontal movement. For those problems, the proposed method combines those informations in order to improve the accuracy. Particularly, in order to estimate three dimensional motion of COM, the proposed method reduces the offset included in the vertical component by utilizing the interference between the horizontal and vertical component of COM shown in third information. Through the simulation, the improvement by the proposed method is verified.",

        "abstract": "Pheromone-based communication is one of the most effective ways of communication widely observed in nature. It is particularly used by social insects such as bees, ants and termites; both for inter-agent and agent-swarm communications. Due to its effectiveness; artificial pheromones have been adopted in multi-robot and swarm robotic systems for more than a decade. Although, pheromone-based communication was implemented by different means like chemical (use of particular chemical compounds) or physical (RFID tags, light, sound) ways, none of them were able to replicate all the aspects of pheromones as seen in nature. In this paper, we propose a novel artificial pheromone system that is reliable, accurate and it uses off-the-shelf components only - LCD screen and low-cost USB camera. The system allows to simulate several pheromones and their interactions and to change parameters of the pheromones (diffusion, evaporation, etc.) on the fly allowing for controllable experiments. We tested the performance of the system using the Colias platform in single-robot and swarm scenarios. To allow the swarm robotics community to use the system for their research, we provide it as a freely available open-source package.",

        "abstract": "Carrying unknown heavy payload is one of the classical problems in robotics. To realize heavy payload capability, the use of high reduction gears, which causes large motor-side inertia and large friction, is inevitable. This paper proposes a disturbance observer (DOB)-based approach that (1) reduces highly amplified motor-side inertia (2) compensates for large friction (3) compensates for the unknown heavy payload without sensory information. However, in principle, the DOB is applicable only for linear system. To overcome this, a concept of effective joint torque is introduced, which allows us to separate linear motor-side dynamics from the nonlinear robot dynamics. As a result, it becomes possible to apply high order DOB to compensate for the uncertainties. Mathematical analysis shows closed-loop stability, optimality, and passivity. Experiments and simulations are performed to verify the method.",

        "abstract": "This paper proposes a novel Cosserat rod model based method to estimate contact forces based on the shape analysis of the catheter. We simplify the original Cosserat rod model to achieve real-time estimation of the force magnitude and directions applied to the catheter tip. The simplified model contains a set of arithmetic equations, which can be rapidly solved using an iterative optimization algorithm. Experimental evaluation shows that the computational frequency of the force estimation was found to be 33.7Hz. Both the magnitude and the direction of the contact force were accurately estimated. The accuracy of the estimations of magnitude was 89.50%, and for the contact direction was 88.13%. Mean errors of the contact force and the contact angle are 7 \u00d7 10-4N and 0.931 degree respectively. To prove the concept, the catheter shape is detected through a RGB camera. However, the proposed method can be easily applied to existing catheter gating and detecting methods using the medical imaging environments such as X-ray fluoroscopy, CT, ultrasound, magnetic field and MRI. The results of evaluation experiments demonstrate what the proposed method is promising for force estimation without the need of a physical force sensor in various types of catheter tips.",

The FUIRS employs a novel biomimetic microrobot to realize underwater manipulation tasks. The main work of this paper is to describe the biomimetic microrobot which is inspired by an octopus. The microrobot is mainly composed of body and arm. We use IPMC to fabricate the arms. To investigate the most suitable arm shape, three commonly used arms were designed, i.e., regular rectangle shape, human finger shape and tapered shape. After analyzing the force and deflection features, the human finger shape arm was selected to be installed on the microrobot. The robot body is fabricated by the 3D printer. A micro proximity sensor was installed on it as the eyes. To enhance the payload of the microrobot, a novel buoyancy adjustment method was proposed which can provide 11.8mN additional buoyancy force. Finally, a series of underwater manipulation experiments were carried out and the results indicated that the biomimetic microrobot can realize underwater manipulation for the targets with different shape and size objects successfully.",

We use a distance minimization approach to compute mean handover orientations. We posit that, computed means of receiver-centered orientations could be used by robot givers to achieve more efficient and socially acceptable handovers. Furthermore, we introduce the notion of affordance axes for comparing handover orientations, and offer a definition for computing them. Observable patterns were found in receiver-centered handover orientations. Comparisons show that depending on the object, natural handover orientations may not be receiver-centered; thus, robots may need to distinguish between good and bad handover orientations when learning from natural handovers.",

Motor stereotypies, which are defined as involuntary repetitive motor behaviors, invariant in form, that, to an observer, appear to serve no purpose, are a class of risk markers which are very amenable to video analysis. These behaviors are associated with mental illnesses such as Autism, Rett Syndrome, and other developmental disabilities. This paper investigates the application of innovative automated methods to recognize these subtle motor indicators. To train and test our methods, a dataset of actions resembling motor stereotypies was created by engaging the normally developing children at the University of Minnesota's Shirley G.

This work demonstrates the applicability of various techniques in the behavioral science domain. The results show that these techniques can perform well on a difficult and challenging real-world scenario.",

In this work we propose a classification of compliant manipulation tasks meeting these requirements, to derive related actions for automated planning. We also present a classification for the sub-category of wiping tasks, which are most common and of great importance in service robotics.We categorize actions from an object-centric perspective to make them independent of any specific robot kinematics.

        "abstract": "Navigating non-holonomic mobile robots in dynamic environments is challenging because it requires computing at each instant, the space of collision free velocities, characterized by a set of highly non-linear and non-convex inequalities. Moreover, uncertainty in obstacle trajectories further increases the complexity of the problem, as it now becomes imperative to relate the space of collision free velocities to a confidence measure. In this paper, we present a novel perspective towards analyzing and solving probabilistic collision avoidance constraints based on our previous works on non-linear time scaling. In particular, we have shown earlier that a time scaled version of collision cone constraints can be solved in closed form and thus can be used to efficiently characterize the space of collision free velocities. In the current proposed work, we present a probabilistic version of time scaled collision cone constraints obtained by representing obstacle states through generic probability distributions. We present a novel reformulation of the probabilistic constraints into a family of deterministic algebraic constraints. The solution space of each member of the family can be derived in closed form and at the same time, can also be related to the lower bound on confidence measure through Cantelli's inequality. Thus, the proposed work represents a significant improvement over the current state of the art frameworks where probabilistic collision avoidance constraints are solved through exhaustive sampling in the state-control space. We also present a cost metric which serves as the basis for the construction of the various collision avoidance maneuvers based on factors like deviation from the current path, acceleration/de-acceleration capability of the robot, confidence of collision avoidance etc. We very briefly explain how the current robot state can be connected to the solution space of safe velocities in smooth time optimal fashion.

        "abstract": "Real-time estimation of human-cloth relationship is crucial for efficient learning of motor skills in robotic clothing assistance. However, cloth state estimation using a depth sensor is a challenging problem with inherent ambiguity. To address this problem, we propose the offline learning of a cloth dynamics model by incorporating reliable motion capture data and applying this model for the online tracking of human-cloth relationship using a depth sensor. In this study, we evaluate the performance of using a shared Gaussian Process Latent Variable Model in learning the dynamics of clothing articles. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of shared GP-LVM in capturing cloth dynamics using few data samples and the ability to generalize to unseen settings. We further demonstrate three key factors that affect the predictive performance of the trained dynamics model.",

Those sensing technologies are in fact necessary for identifying the presence of unforeseen objects, and measuring their position and velocity. Furthermore, classification is necessary for effectively predicting their behavior. In this paper we consider the presence of sensing systems both on-board each vehicle, and installed on infrastructural elements. While the simultaneous presence of multiple sources of information heavily improves the amount (and quality) of available data, it generates the need for effective data fusion and storage systems. Hence, we introduce a centralized cloud service, that is in charge of receiving and merging data acquired by different sensing systems. Those data are then distributed to the autonomous vehicles, that exploit them for implementing advanced navigation strategies. The proposed methodology is validated in a real industrial environment to safely perform obstacle avoidance with an autonomously driven forklift.",

        "abstract": "In co-manipulation, humans and robots solve manipulation tasks together. Virtual guides are important tools for co-manipulation, as they constrain the movement of the robot to avoid undesirable effects, such as collisions with the environment. Defining virtual guides is often a laborious task requiring expert knowledge. This restricts the usefulness of virtual guides in environments where new tasks may need to be solved, or where multiple tasks need to be solved sequentially, but in an unknown order. To this end, we propose a framework for multiple probabilistic virtual guides, and demonstrate a concrete implementation of such guides using kinesthetic teaching and Gaussian mixture models. Our approach enables non-expert users to design virtual guides through demonstration. Also, they may demonstrate novel guides, even if already known guides are active. Finally, users are able to intuitively select the appropriate guide from a set of guides through physical interaction with the robot. We evaluate our approach in a pick-and-place task, where users are to place objects at one of several positions in a cupboard.",

Due to the lack of a discriminable representation between a target and its surroundings in different viewpoints, realizing cognitive sharing of the object among the robots in an unconstructed environment is a challenging issue. In this paper, we propose novel description algorithms of the target representation based on ambiguity minimization of peripheral context. The target is represented by a labeled-graph and its structure is determined by minimizing a metric of representational ambiguity using an entropy evaluation with metaheuristics. Experimental results show the significantly improvement of cognitive sharing by the proposed method.",

In our method, the structure is formed by growing chain of blocks. The growth direction is determined by the rule set and a counter value passed between the blocks. The robots load or unload the block based on a simple algorithm and a local signal from the blocks. Because of the simplicity of each robot's behavior, the structure is locally unstable: the blocks can be attached or detached randomly from the structure even if they have already formed a part of the structure. In this paper, we first explain the mechanism of our proposal. Next we show some fundamental characteristics obtained by computer simulation and small scale experiment by real robot and blocks. We introduce small modification to enhance the adaptability of the system mainly focusing on a reinforcement function of the wall against the external stress.",

This method can be used to update the estimated contact points in self-reconfiguration. Incorporating a grasp quality metric of form closure into self-reconfiguration, the structure for grasping can be evaluated until a desired metric is obtained.

An assembly skill is a primitive that encapsulates the capabilities to coordinate, control and supervise an elementary robot task. To gain reusability of a primitive in alike robot tasks, the primitives are represented as generic templates that are parametrized for each situation with data from an assembly specification. A skill is represented in two ways, namely as a trajectory describing compliant motions in pose-wrench space and as a finite state machine. This approach comes with the potential to simplify robot programming and to improve robustness in robotic assembly due to inherent quality checking.

In this paper, we summarize our previous contributions - refining symbolic actions at geometric level, during the symbolic planning, in order to assess their feasibility and computing the geometric side effects-, then we present the current contributions meant to tighten the cooperation between the symbolic planning and the geometric planning: the symbolic planner helps the geometric one by providing it with constraints and domain-expert knowledge making the geometric planner more efficient, and the geometric planner helps the symbolic one to find the best plan based on social costs computed at geometric level. We also propose different examples, highlighting the interest of such cooperation between the planners in simulation and on our PR2 robot.",

        "abstract": "We consider the problem of enabling a robot to efficiently obtain a dense haptic map of its visible surroundings using the complementary properties of vision and tactile sensing. Our approach assumes that visible surfaces that look similar to one another are likely to have similar haptic properties. We present an iterative algorithm that enables a robot to infer dense haptic labels across visible surfaces when given a color-plus-depth (RGB-D) image along with a sequence of sparse haptic labels representative of what could be obtained via tactile sensing. Our method uses a color-based similarity measure and connected components on color and depth data. We evaluated our method using several publicly available RGBD image datasets with indoor cluttered scenes pertinent to robot manipulation. We analyzed the effects of algorithm parameters and environment variation, specifically the level of clutter and the type of setting, like a shelf, table top, or sink area. In these trials, the visible surface for each object consisted of an average of 8602 pixels, and we provided the algorithm with a sequence of haptically-labeled pixels up to a maximum of 40 times the number of objects in the image. On average, our algorithm correctly assigned haptic labels to 76.02% of all of the object pixels in the image given this full sequence of labels. We also performed experiments with the humanoid robot DARCI reaching in a cluttered foliage environment while using our algorithm to create a haptic map. Doing so enabled the robot to reach goal locations using a single plan after a single greedy reach, while our previous tactile-only mapping method required 5 or more plans to reach each goal.",

The robotic wheelchair uses light projection to communicate its motion intentions. The novelty of the work is threefold: the communication of robot intentions to the passenger, the consideration of passenger and robot as a group (\u201cin-group\u201d) [1] who share motion intentions and the communication of the in-group intentions to other pedestrians (the \u201cout-group\u201d). A comparison in an autonomous navigation task where the robotic wheelchair autonomously navigates the environment with and without intention communication was performed showing that passengers and walking people found intention communication intuitive and helpful for passing by actions. Evaluation results significantly show human participant preference for having navigational intention communication for the wheelchair passenger and the person passing by it. Quantitative results show the motion of the person passing by the wheelchair with intention communication was significantly smoother compared to without intention communication.",

The position of the human hand is measured by a non-contact motion tracker, but the force feedback is realized by a handheld haptic device. A gripping force is displayed by a pneumatic bellows, which is smaller and more lightweight than electric motors. As for the slave manipulator, the gripper of a surgical forceps is actuated using a pneumatic cylinder. Force estimation is possible due to the back-drivability of the pneumatic actuator. Experimental results show the control performance of the haptic device and a constructed master-slave system.",

        "abstract": "This paper presents a reconfiguration algorithm for a robot composed of sliding cube modules with a limited motion primitive. We assume that a cube module is not allowed to make convex motions around other modules but is allowed to slide across other modules' surfaces. Such a motion primitive limitation complicates the development of the reconfiguration algorithm; however, it simplifies the design of module hardware and reduces the size and manufacturing costs of modules. The algorithm uses a three-dimensional 2 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 2 meta-module to guarantee the existence of mobile modules and maintain the connectivity of the robot structure during the reconfiguration process. The transition of the meta-module is executed by the tunneling of cube modules. The tunneling movement is efficiently controlled by focusing on the motion of voids that are invoked through the transition of meta-modules. We show that the algorithm is complete for a connected robot structure with more than a certain number of meta-modules and that the reconfiguration in an environment with obstacles is executed in quadratic operating time cost.",

A parallel four-bar linkage connects the inner frame to the outer frame, and walking locomotion is achieved by an another four-bar linkage with a single DC motor. The robot's footpads use a dry adhesive system, and the robot is small and lightweight. Experimental results reveal that the robotic platform can climb on various curved surfaces with a radius of curvature between 50 mm and infinity in the vertical direction. The platform could be used for cleaning high-rise buildings and solar panels with different curvature.",

The full system consists of two wings independently driven by geared pager motors that include a spring in parallel with the output shaft. The linear transmission allows for resonant operation, while control is achieved by direct drive of the wing angle. Wings used in previous work were chosen to be fully rigid for simplicity of modeling and fabrication. However, biological wings are highly flexible and other micro air vehicles have successfully utilized flexible wing structures for specialized tasks. The goal of our study is to determine if wing flexibility can be generally used to increase wing performance. Two approaches to lift improvement using flexible wings are explored, resonance of the wing cantilever structure and dynamic wing twisting. We design and test several wings that are compared using different figures of merit. A twisted design improved lift per power by 73.6% and maximum lift production by 53.2% compared to the original rigid design. Wing twist is then modeled in order to propose optimal wing twist profiles that can maximize either wing efficiency or lift production.",

In industrial applications, controller tuning is a time consuming task, which is especially critical when the gain values have a considerable impact on the use of the robot's energy resources. In this paper, we propose a set of approaches to automatically improve the performance of well-known path tracking controllers used for agricultural applications of automated agricultural machinery. The effect of the proposed strategy can be better appreciated during the transient response of the robot when it has to maneuver along a non-kinematically compatible path. The results presented in this work show that the robot's path tracking performance is improved up to 15% using the proposed approaches.",

In the frictionless case, impulses at all the contacts, initialized via solution of a non-linear system, accumulate over different phases (compression and restitution) tracked through numerical integration. Experiment over Newton's cradle, using vision-based velocity estimation, achieves a close agreement with simulation. The presence of friction requires a contact mode analysis via solution of a linear system to check for contact mode consistencies with Coulomb's friction law. Simulation of nine-ball break shots, drawing upon a recent trajectory study [6], yields realistic scenarios. The modeling approach is part of our efforts toward planning for robotic manipulation strategies using impulsive forces.",

        "abstract": "We propose a method for a robot to form various concepts. The robot uses its embodiment to obtain visual, auditory, and haptic information by grasping, shaking, and observing objects. At the same time, a user teaches the robot object features through speech. From these kinds of information, the robot can form object concepts. The information obtained by the robot is converted into Bag-of-Words representations, which are classified into categories. The proposed method is based on a stochastic model, and objects can be classified by estimating their parameters. We introduce the Chinese restaurant process into the multimodal hierarchical Dirichlet process. This model is an infinite mixture of models and enables the robot to form various concepts such as object type, color, and so on. Therefore, the robot can form not only object concepts but also various concepts that are not represented by object concepts (e.g., color). Also, because the proposed method is based on a stochastic model, it makes it possible for the robot to estimate category and unobserved information of unseen objects. We implement the proposed method on a robot and show that it can form various concepts and perform various estimations for unseen objects.",

Growing complexity of robotics software increases the importance of applying proper software engineering principles and methods such as design patterns to robotics. Concurrency design patterns are particularly interesting to robotics because robots often have many components that can operate in parallel. However, there has not yet been any established set of reusable concurrency design patterns for robotics. For this purpose, we choose six known concurrency patterns - Future, Periodic timer, Invoke later, Active object, Cooperative cancellation, and Guarded suspension. We demonstrate how these patterns could be used for solving common robotic coordination tasks. We also discuss advantages and disadvantages of the patterns and how existing robotics programming frameworks can support them.",

        "abstract": "In open-ended domains, robots must continuously learn new object categories. When the training sets are created offline, it is not possible to ensure their representativeness with respect to the object categories and features the system will find when operating online. In the Bag of Words model, visual codebooks are usually constructed from training sets created offline. This might lead to non-discriminative visual words and, as a consequence, to poor recognition performance. This paper proposes a visual object recognition system which concurrently learns in an incremental and online fashion both the visual object category representations as well as the codebook words used to encode them. The codebook is defined using Gaussian Mixture Models which are updated using new object views. The approach contains similarities with the human visual object recognition system: evidence suggests that the development of recognition capabilities occurs on multiple levels and is sustained over large periods of time. Results show that the proposed system with concurrent learning of object categories and codebooks is capable of learning more categories, requiring less examples, and with similar accuracies, when compared to the classical Bag of Words approach using codebooks constructed offline.",

Identified parameters can be used in model based controllers. The presented approach is validated through simulation and on data collected with the Barret WAM manipulator.

        "abstract": "In this paper, we propose a framework for intuitive task-based programming of robots using geometric inter-relational constraints. The intended applications of this framework are robot programming interfaces that use semantically rich task descriptions, allow intuitive (re-)programming, and are suitable for non-expert users typically found in SMEs. A key concept in this work is the use of CAD semantics to represent geometric entities in the robotic workcell. The robot tasks are then represented as a set of geometrical inter-relational constraints, which are solved in real-time to be executed on the robot. Since these constraints often specify the target pose only partially, the robot can be controlled to move in the constraints' null space in order to handle external disturbances or further optimize the robot's pose during runtime. Geometrical inter-relational constraints are easy to understand and can be intuitively specified using CAD software. A number of applications common in industrial robotic scenarios have been chosen to highlight the advantages of the presented approach vis-\u00e0-vis the state-of-the-art approaches.",

        "track": "main",
        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "For generating whole-body behavior involving contacts with environments such as climbing ladder behavior or walking on terrain behavior, \u201ccontact-before-motion\u201d approach was used in some previous researches. By separating contact search process and motion search process, whole-body behavior generation was achieved. However, in previous researches, there were few examinations about contact transition strategies while generating behavior. For changing contact states, there are many kinds of contact transition strategies such as walking, sliding, rotating and so on. For example, while generating standing up behavior, it is important to switch contact transition strategies because the lack of degree of freedom makes it difficult to detach limb contacts from ground, and it may be desirable not to detach contacts but to slide them. In this study, we propose a novel whole-body behavior generation algorithm which involves contact transition strategies switching function. Especially, in this paper, we focus on the walk-type and slide-type transition strategies switching. We call walk-type transition as the contact transition process which detaches some contacts, moves them, and attaches them again. Besides, we call slide-type transition as the contact transition process which keeps on attaching contacts, and slides to move them. By using this algorithm, it is possible to generate whole-body behaviors which are difficult or impossible to achieve only with walk-type transition and which are more desirable by comparing multiple transition strategies. Finally, we evaluated this algorithm by generating standing up behavior and sitting on chair behavior.",

        "abstract": "In this paper, we propose a new approach for recognizing intentions of humans by observing their activities with an RGB-D camera. Activities and goals are modeled as a distributed network of inter-connected nodes in an Activation Spreading Network (ASN). Inspired by a formalism in hierarchical task networks, the structure of the network captures the hierarchical relationship between high-level goals and low-level activities that realize these goals. Our approach can detect intentions before they are realized and it can work in real-time. We also extend the formalism of ASNs to incorporate contextual information into intent recognition. A fully functioning system is developed for experimental evaluation. We implemented a robotic system that uses our intent recognition to naturally interact with the user. Our ASN based intent recognizer is tested against two different scenarios involving everyday activities performed by a subject, and our results show that the proposed approach is able to detect low-level activities and recognize high-level intentions effectively in real-time. Further analysis shows that contextual ASN is able to discriminate between otherwise ambiguous goals.",

        "abstract": "Online 3D point cloud classification and scene understanding are crucial tasks for Unmanned Ground Vehicles (UGVs) equipped with multiple laser scanners. Due to the poor performance of traditional 2D image representation model for 3D point clouds, a novel Optimal Bearing Angle (OBA) model is therefore proposed to overcome the limitations of texture information losing and image blurring caused by the UGV's on-the-fly navigation. With the result of 3DSLIC based super-pixel segmentation in OBA images, the center of points belonging to each segmented OBA image patch is assigned as CRF graph node, so that a simplified CRF graph structure is constructed for online contextual classification of 3D laser points in urban environments. Moreover, total 29-dimensional features are extracted from both the raw 3D laser points and the corresponding OBA images. A large number of urban scenes selected from both DUT2 dataset and KAIST dataset are used as testing data in our experiments, and the results show the validity and performance of the proposed method.",

        "abstract": "Cut along the surface of a polyhedron and unfold it to a planar structure without overlapping is known as Unfolding Polyhedra problem which has been extensively studied in the mathematics literature for centuries. However, whether there exists a continuous unfolding motion such that the polyhedron can be continuously transformed to its unfolding has not been well studied. Recently, researchers started to recognize continuous unfolding as a key step in designing and implementation of self-folding robots. In this paper, we model the unfolding of a polyhedron as multi-link tree-structure articulated robot, and address this problem using motion planning techniques. Instead of sampling in continuous domain which traditional motion planners do, we propose to sample only in the discrete domain. Our experimental results show that sampling in discrete domain is efficient and effective for finding feasible unfolding paths.",

        "abstract": "This paper reports on a system for dynamic obstacle tracking for autonomous vehicles. In this work, we seek to simultaneously estimate both the trajectory of the obstacle and the obstacle's shape. These two tasks are inherently coupled-given only noisy partial views, one cannot accurately estimate the trajectory of an obstacle if its shape is unknown, nor can one estimate its shape without knowing its trajectory. To address this challenge, we note that simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM), where a robot must build a map of the environment while localizing itself within the map, presents similar challenges. By treating the obstacle's shape as a \u201cmap\u201d in the obstacle's moving reference frame, we can formulate the obstacle tracking and shape estimation similarly to SLAM. Additionally, we use a continuous time estimation framework to incorporate sensor data that is collected at a fast rate (e.g., light detection and ranging (LIDAR)). Using these methods, we are able to obtain smooth trajectories and crisp point clouds for tracked obstacles. We test our proposed tracker on real-world data collected by our autonomous vehicle platform and demonstrate that it produces improved results when compared to a standard centroid-based extended Kalman filter (EKF) tracker.",

We then propose a parametrization of contact forces and a formulation of the constraints which allow to write a tractable optimization program whose solution verifies at any instant all the constraints where those forces appear. We finish by exemplifying the approach with preliminary results obtained on a HRP-2 humanoid robot.",

        "abstract": "Series elastic actuators primarily use linear springs in their drivetrains, which introduces a design tradeoff: soft springs provide higher torque resolution at the cost of system bandwidth, whereas stiff springs provide a fast response but lower torque resolution. Nonlinear springs (NLSs) potentially incorporate the benefits of both soft and stiff springs, but such springs are often large. An NLS design was recently proposed that combines a variable radius cam with a rubber elastic element, enabling a compact spring design. However, the rubber introduces hysteresis, which can lead to poor torque tracking if not accounted for in the controller. To overcome this limitation, we here propose a state observer that captures hysteretic effects exhibited by the rubber to provide an accurate estimate of actuator torque. We perform torque-control experiments with this observer on an actuator testbed and compare the performance of the NLS to both soft and stiff linear metal springs. Experiments show that the NLS exhibits improved output impedance compared to both linear springs, and comparable bandwidth to the stiff linear spring up to 1.5 Hz. However, the hysteresis in the urethane rubber introduces instability in higher-frequency conditions, suggesting that future NLS designs can be improved by use of a different rubber as the elastic element.",

Based on this indicator, a safety criterion accounting for the breaking capabilities of the robot is included as a quadratic constraint in the control algorithm. This constraint is modulated by the distance between the human operator and the end-effector of the robot. The control algorithm is formulated as an optimization problem and computes the actuation torque of a robotic manipulator given some task to be performed and physical constraints to respect. The overall framework is validated in a physics simulation software on a Kuka LWR4 and different behaviours of the robot towards a considered obstacle in its environment are evaluated and discussed.",

        "abstract": "A novel control scheme based on wave variables for controlling the teleoperation system over the time-varying delayed communication is proposed. Regarding to the symmetric wave teleoperation control layout, the control is achieved by adjusting the wave variables based on the difference between the desired and the fictitious position, which is obtained from integrating the non-distorted wave variables. The resulting wave is then applied to the master/slave robots controlled with local PD controller. By this control scheme, the system is stable and the position difference of the master and slave is proven to converge to zero in the free motion case if the time delay is continuously differentiable. In addition, the slave-environment interaction force is reflected to the operator precisely when the static contact is made during steady time delay. This control scheme can readily be extended to the implementation of the teleoperation system in full task space SO(3) \u00d7 \u211d3.",

This algorithm is called Convex Cut (CC) because of its two main steps: cutting the PCD with arbitrary planes, and extracting convex parts. CC can be used as a preprocessing module for other existing algorithms to extract static parts in dynamic environments or to represent a principal 3D model of a given PCD. Its calculation time is 24 milliseconds for 50k PCD on a consumer PC, and it yields a precision value of 0.90 and a recall value of 0.99 on average in highly dynamic and cluttered environments. Some possible applications are explained such as simultaneous localization and mapping in dynamic environments, efficient dense map representation, robust 3D scan matching with plane features, and natural motion planning.",

        "abstract": "In the future mobile dual-arm robots are expected to perform many tasks. Kinematically, the configuration of two manipulators that branch from the same common mobile base results in a serial-to-parallel kinematic structure, which makes inverse kinematic computations non-trivial. The motion of the base has to be decided in a trade-off, taking the needs of both arms into account. We propose to use a Virtual Kinematic Chain (VKC) to specify the common motion of the parallel manipulators, instead of using the two manipulators kinematics directly. With this VKC, we formulate a constraint based programming solution for the robot to respond to external disturbances during task execution. The proposed approach is experimentally verified both in a noise-free illustrative simulation and a real human robot co-manipulation task.",

To this aim, two impedance filters are used to determine the reference trajectories for manipulator end effectors: the first is aimed at conferring a compliant behavior at the object level (external impedance), while the second filter, is aimed at avoiding large internal loading of the object (internal impedance). Such trajectories are fed to a motion controller including an inverse kinematics algorithm and a PD controller with gravity compensation.

We consider a decentralized leader-follower architecture where the leading robot, that has exclusive knowledge of the object's desired trajectory, tries to achieve the desired tracking behavior via an impedance control law. On the other hand, the follower estimates the leader's desired motion via a novel prescribed performance estimation law, that drives the estimation error to an arbitrarily small residual set, and implements a similar impedance control law. Both control schemes adopt feedback linearization as well as load sharing among the robots according to their specific payload capabilities. The feedback relies exclusively on each robot's force/torque, position as well as velocity measurements and apart from a few commonly predetermined constant parameters, no explicit data is exchanged on-line among the robots, thus reducing the required communication bandwidth and increasing robustness. Finally, a comparative simulation study clarifies the proposed",

        "abstract": "This work tackles the problem of pursuit-evasion games between two pursuing and one evading unmanned aerial vehicle. The solution of this problem is derived by introducing a hierarchical decomposition of the game. On a superordinate collaboration level, the pursuers choose their optimal behavioral strategy (i.e. pursue and herd) resulting in a three-player non-cooperative dynamic game which is solved in a subordinate level of the overall game. This structure enables an intelligent behavior change for the pursuers based on game-theoretical solution methods. Depending on the state of the game it has to be evaluated which behavioral strategy yields the best results for the pursuers within the regarded time horizon. It is shown, that the pursuer's outcome can be improved by using a superordinate cooperation between them. Furthermore, this application was implemented on a real quad-rotor system. In experiments the quad-rotor teamed-up with a software-emulated pursuer and it was shown that another software-emulated quad-rotor was caught. This framework provides a solution concept for all types of dynamic games with an arbitrary number of players and teams having a non-cooperative and cooperative nature. The hierarchical decomposition gives more flexibility and allows team members to co-ordinate their behavior and thus to maximize their outcome.",

The objective of this work is to formulate decentralized control algorithms that enable multiple vehicles to follow a target while coordinating their phase separation. A typical scenario involves multiple aerial surveillance UAVs which are required to monitor a moving ground object (target tracking), while maintaining a desired inter-vehicle separation (coordination). To solve the tracking problem, the yaw rate of each vehicle is used as control input, while the ground speeds are adjusted to achieve coordination. It is assumed that the UAVs are equipped with an internal autopilot, which is able to track yaw rate and ground speed commands. The performance of the coordinated vision-based tracking algorithm is evaluated as a function of target's velocity, tracking performance of the onboard autopilot, and the quality of service of the communication network.",

        "abstract": "We consider a problem on the synthesis of optimal reactive controllers with an a priori unknown performance criterion while satisfying a given temporal logic specification through the interaction with an uncontrolled environment. We decouple the problem into two sub-problems. First, we extract a (maximally) permissive strategy for the system, which encodes multiple (possibly all) ways in which the system can react to the adversarial environment and satisfy the specifications. Then, we quantify the a priori unknown performance criterion as a (still unknown) reward function, and compute - by using the so-called maximin-Q learning algorithm - an optimal strategy for the system within the operating envelope allowed by the permissive strategy. We establish both correctness (with respect to the temporal logic specifications) and optimality (with respect to the a priori unknown performance criterion) of this two-step technique for a fragment of temporal logic specifications. For specifications beyond this fragment, correctness can still be preserved, but the learned strategy may be sub-optimal. We present an algorithm to the overall problem, and demonstrate its use and computational requirements on a set of robot motion planning examples.",

        "abstract": "Many modern robotics applications require robots to function autonomously in dynamic environments including other decision making agents, such as people or other robots. This calls for fast and scalable interactive motion planning. This requires models that take into consideration the other agent's intended actions in one's own planning. We present a real-time motion planning framework that brings together a few key components including intention inference by reasoning counterfactually about potential motion of the other agents as they work towards different goals. By using a light-weight motion model, we achieve efficient iterative planning for fluid motion when avoiding pedestrians, in parallel with goal inference for longer range movement prediction. This inference framework is coupled with a novel distributed visual tracking method that provides reliable and robust models for the current belief-state of the monitored environment. This combined approach represents a computationally efficient alternative to previously studied policy learning methods that often require significant offline training or calibration and do not yet scale to densely populated environments. We validate this framework with experiments involving multi-robot and human-robot navigation. We further validate the tracker component separately on much larger scale unconstrained pedestrian data sets.",

        "abstract": "Visual Odometry (VO) is a proven technology for planetary exploration rovers, facilitating their localization with a small error over medium-sized trajectories. However, due to VO's incremental mode of operation, its estimation error accumulates over time, resulting in considerable drift for long trajectories. This paper proposes a global localization method that counters VO drift by matching boulders extracted from overhead and ground images and using them periodically to relocalize the rover and refine VO estimates. The performance of the proposed method is evaluated with the aid of overhead imagery of different resolutions. Experimental results demonstrate that a very terse representation, consisting of approximate boulder locations only, suffices for significantly improving the accuracy of VO over long traverses.",

Our scene matcher adopts naive Bayes nearest neighbor (NBNN) techniques, where (1) raw visual features are used without vector quantization, and (2) image-to-class (rather than image-to-image) distance is used for scene comparison. Finally, we acquire a challenging cross-season place recognition dataset and validate the effectiveness of the proposed scene descriptor.",

We formulate this problem as a distributed stochastic program with a non-convex objective and present a block variant of the Arrow-Hurwicz saddle point algorithm to solve it. Only neighboring nodes in the communications network need to exchange information, and we penalize the discrepency between the individual feature basis and classifiers using Lagrange multipliers. The application we consider is for a team of robots to collaboratively recognize objects of interest in dynamic environments. As a preliminary performance benchmark, we consider the problem of learning a texture classifier across a network of robots moving around an urban setting where separate training examples are sequentially observed at each robot. Results are shown for both a standard texture dataset and a new dataset from an urban training facility, and we compare the performance of the standard centralized construction to the new distributed algorithm for the case when distinct samples from all classes are seen by the robots. These experiments yield comparable performance between the decentralized and the centralized cases, demonstrating the proposed method's practical utility.",

Highly textured image areas are mapped using standard direct mapping techniques [1], that minimize the photometric error across different views. We make the assumption that homogeneous-color regions belong to approximately planar areas. Our contribution is a new algorithm for the estimation of such planar areas, based on the information of a superpixel segmentation and the semidense map from highly textured areas. We compare our approach against several alternatives using the public TUM dataset [2] and additional live experiments with a hand-held camera. We demonstrate that our proposal for piecewise planar monocular SLAM is faster, more accurate and more robust than the piecewise planar baseline [3]. In addition, our experimental results show how the depth regularization of monocular maps can damage its accuracy, being the piecewise planar assumption a reasonable option in indoor scenarios.",

The first method is based on frequency analysis of the correlation coefficient sequence of sensor array data sampled as time evolves. The main idea is that a slippage causes heavier fluctuation in the sensor signal distribution and values than a static case. The second approach employs 2-D cross correlation to detect displacements of the sliding object from tactile images, which makes it possible to estimate the slippage velocity using commercially available sensors rather than custom hardware. Experiments have been implemented to evaluate the proposed approaches. It can be seen that the first method is capable of detecting both translational and rotational slippage. Also, it works well in dynamic environments. Additionally, the ability of the second method to detect slippage velocity has been confirmed in the experiment.",

Given a set of tasks and a set of robots each with its own utility function, this problem concerns the non-overlapping allocation of tasks to agents maximising the sum of the robot's utility functions. Our algorithm provides a constant factor approximation of (1 - 1/e \u2248 63%) for positive-valued monotone submodular utility functions, and of (1/e \u2248 37%) for positive-valued non-monotone submodular utility functions. In our algorithm, robots only rely on local utility function and neighbour to neighbour communications to find the solution. The algorithm proceeds in two steps. Initially, the robots use Maximum Consensus-based algorithm to find a relaxed solution of the problem using the multilinear extension of their utility functions. Finally, they follow a randomised rounding procedure to exchange valuations on sets of tasks in order to round the relaxed solution. To conclude, we provide experimental evidence of our claims for both monotone and non-monotone submodular functions.",

        "abstract": "In this paper, we consider the two dimensional (2-D) predecessor-following control problem for a platoon of unicycle vehicles moving on a planar surface. More specifically, we design a decentralized kinematic control protocol, in the sense that each vehicle calculates its own control signal based solely on local information regarding its preceding vehicle, by its on-board camera, without incorporating any velocity measurements. Additionally, the transient and steady state response is a priori determined by certain designer-specified performance functions and is fully decoupled by the number of vehicles composing the platoon and the control gains selection. Moreover, collisions between successive vehicles as well as connectivity breaks, owing to the limited field of view of cameras, are provably avoided. Finally, an extensive simulation study is carried out in the WEBOTSTM realistic simulator, clarifying the proposed control scheme and verifying its effectiveness.",

The agents collaboratively carry an object in a leader-follower scheme and lack means to exchange messages on-line, i.e., to communicate explicitly. Specifically, we propose a decentralized control protocol and a leader re-election strategy that secure the accomplishment of both agents' local goal specifications. The challenge herein lies in exploiting exclusively implicit inter-robot communication that is a natural outcome of the physical interaction of the robots with the object. An illustrative experiment is included clarifying and verifying the approach.",

Long transmission times, scheduling delays and packet losses remain obstacles to implementing real-time multi-vehicle cooperative control for marine vehicles. We present a control system for dynamic pursuit with multiple vehicles exchanging time-difference-of-arrival (TDOA) measurements via underwater acoustic communications. Using data from field experiments conducted with autonomous surface vehicles, we show that a decentralized controller can track fast-moving targets and formation changes, leveraging partial information updates and decreased effective cycle times. As a comparison, we show results for trials conducted with one similar but centralized control scheme.",

This methodology is embedded in a larger visual mapping framework aiming to produce accurate and dense topometric urban maps. Our method is based on two main filtering stages. Firstly, we perform a segmentation process considering both geometric and photometric image constraints, followed by a regularization step (spatial-integration). We then proceed to a fusion stage where the geometric information is further refined by considering the depth images of nearby frames (temporal integration). This methodology can be applied to other projective models, such as perspective stereo images. Our approach is evaluated within the frameworks of image registration, localization and mapping, demonstrating higher accuracy and larger convergence domains over different datasets.",

We provide a detailed description of the algorithm and evaluate its speed/accuracy trade-offs on an indoor person detection dataset collected from a mobile platform, showing that our RGBD approach outperforms accuracy of RGB-only DPM, depth-only DPM, and RGB HOG SVM classifier cascades. We furthermore demonstrate how reductions in model complexity and feature space dimensionality can increase speed without significantly sacrificing detector accuracy.",

This design features a unified mechanism for anchoring, navigating, and rotating an insertable camera by externally generated rotational magnetic field. The design is inspired by the spherical motor concept where the external stator generates anchoring and rotational magnetic field to control the motion of the insertable robotic capsule camera. The insertable camera body, which has no active locomotion mechanism onboard, is capsulated in a one-piece housing with two ringshaped tail-end magnets and one cylindrical central magnet embedded on-board as a rotor. The stator positioned outside an abdominal cavity consists of both permanent magnets and electromagnetic coils for generating reliable rotational magnetic field. The initial prototype results in a compact insertable camera robot with a 12.7mm diameter and a 68mm length. The design concepts are analyzed theoretically and verified experimentally. The experiments validate that the proposed capsule robot design provides reliable camera fixation and locomotion capabilities under various testing conditions.",

        "abstract": "In this paper, a rotational leg-type miniature robot with an actuated middle joint and tail, called RoMiRAMT, is proposed for stable locomotion and improved climbing ability. The robot has four independently actuated rotational legs, giving it advantages of both wheel-type and leg-type locomotion. The design parameters of the rotational legs were determined by 3D simulation within the properly selected candidates. It also has unique characteristics inspired by biological structures: a spine and a tail. An actuated middle joint allows the frontal body to be lifted or lowered, which was inspired by a spine, to climb higher obstacles. Additionally, a multi-functional two degrees of freedom (2-DOF) tail was added; the tail provides instant deceleration, and minimized the likelihood of flipping, while allowing the robot to climb higher obstacles. A microcontroller was embedded in the robot, along with a micro-camera and an inertia measurement unit (IMU) sensor. By controlling the robot using the yaw angle signal measured by the IMU sensor, straight movement was enhanced. The body size of the RoMiRAMT is 155 \u00d7 80 mm without the rotational legs, and the weight is 593 g including batteries. The maximum velocity of the robot was 2.58 m/s (16.65 body lengths per second) and the maximum height of an obstacle that the robot can climb was 95 mm, which all were verified by experiments.",

        "abstract": "Micro manipulation is essential for tissue indentation tasks in micro-scale experiment, and microscopes must be equipped with multi degree-of-freedom (DOF) stages to accurately reach the regions of interest (ROI). Current microscope stages have three main drawbacks when applied to material characterization tasks. First, most microscope stages are designed for 2- or 3-DOF manipulation, lacking the ability to rotate the specimen. Second, the average micro-positioning stage is manually adjusted, and finally most stages accomplish either a large travel range or sub-micron resolution manipulation, but not both. These limitations pose a challenge for phenotyping diseases using quantitative mechanical signatures. This research is motivated by the need for improved accuracy in breast cancer detection. The following work aims to improve upon current micro-positioning stages by allowing for 4-DOF motion (XY\u03b8 for in-plane motion and Z direction indentation) and the ability to employ a variety of devices for material characterization. The ability to rotate the specimen will provide improved accuracy in reaching the ROI and robust measurement in uncertain specimen environments. The work described herein explains the design and analysis toward an under-actuated micro-positioning stage for automated tissue indentation.",

        "abstract": "According to the automobile industry's flexible manufacturing requirements, a novel flexible fixturing system for sheet metal assembly is proposed with parallel robots. A methodology of the structure synthesis is presented by taking account simultaneously several performance indices. Taking the 3UPU/UPS parallel robot in the system as an example, models of inverse kinematics, Jacobian matrix and design space are developed. Thus, the structure synthesis of the parallel robot is simplified to a two-dimensional problem. Once the performance indices (workspace, singularity and stiffness) are established, the corresponding indices atlases are expressed in the design space. The structure parameters of the parallel robot are obtained by analyzing these atlases. The prototype of the fixturing system is developed, and the relevant clamping and stiffness experiments are conducted. The experimental results generally agree well with the simulation results and satisfy the flexible fixturing systems' requirements.",

        "track": "main",
        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "Ball-balancing robots (BBRs) are endowed with rich dynamics. When properly designed and stabilized via feedback to eliminate jitter, and intuitively coordinated with a well-designed smartphone interface, BBRs exhibit a uniquely fluid and organic motion. Unlike mobile inverted pendulums (MIPs, akin to unmanned Segways), BBRs stabilize both fore/aft and left/right motions with feedback, and bank when turning. Previous research on BBRs focused on vehicles from 50cm to 2m in height; the present work is the first to build significantly smaller BBRs, with heights under 25cm. We consider the unique issues arising when miniaturizing a BBR to such a scale, which are characterized by faster time scales and reduced weight (and, thus, reduced normal force and stiction between the omniwheels and the ball). Two key patent-pending aspects of our design are (a) moving the omniwheels to contact the ball down to around 20 to 30 deg N latitude, which increases the normal force between the omniwheels and the ball, and (b) orienting the omniwheels into mutually-orthogonal planes, which improves efficiency. Design iterations were facilitated by rapid prototyping and leveraged low-cost manufacturing principles and inexpensive components. Classical successive loop closure control strategies are implemented, which prove to be remarkably effective when the BBR isn't spinning quickly, and thus the left/right and fore/aft stabilization problems decompose into two decoupled MIP problems.",

        "abstract": "This paper presents the design and control of a teleoperated robotic system for dexterous micromanipulation tasks at the meso-scale, specifically open microsurgery. Robotic open microsurgery is an unexplored yet potentially a high impact area of surgical robotics. Microsurgical operations, such as microanastomosis of blood vessels and reattachment of nerve fibers, require high levels of manual dexterity and accuracy that surpass human capabilities. A 3-DoF robotic wrist is designed and built based on a spherical five-bar mechanism. The wrist is attached to a 3-axis commercial off-the-shelf linear stage, achieving a fully dexterous system. Design requirements are determined using motion data collected during a simulated microanastomosis operation. The wrist design is optimized to maximize workspace and manipulability. The system is teleoperated using a haptic device, and has the required bandwidth to replicate microsurgical motions. The system was successfully used in a micromanipulation task to stack 1 mm-diameter metal spheres. The micromanipulation system presented here may improve surgical outcomes during open microsurgery by offering better accuracy and dexterity to surgeons.",

        "abstract": "Robotic exoskeletons have drawn much attention recently due to their potential ability to help the stroke and spinal cord injury patients to regain the ability of walking. However, the biggest challenge is the balancing of the exoskeleton and how it can balance is still an open question. Most of the time, patients using such exoskeleton devices require sufficient upper body strength to control upright posture and also manipulate crutches/walking frames to partially support body weight and keep balance. However, high energy cost and the high potential of falling using these devices remains a problem. In this paper, the issues are tackled by virtue of a proposed balance stabilizer mechanism which is able to provide active balance assistance for robotic exoskeletons. The design of a robotic exoskeleton together with balance stabilizer mechanism will be presented and discussed. In addition, a trajectory generation method, which can generate dynamically stable and tunable gait pattern, will also be shown. Finally, clinical trial results with a tetraplegia subject is presented and discussed.",

        "abstract": "Brain tumor, be it primary or metastatic, is usually life threatening for a person at any age. The risks involved in carrying out surgery within a brain can cause severe anxiety in patients. However, primary surgical resection which is one of the most effective ways of treating brain tumors can have a tremendously increased success rate if the appropriate imaging modality is used for complete tumor resection. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is the imaging modality of choice for brain tumor imaging because of its excellent soft-tissue contrast. MRI combined with continuum soft robotics has immense potential to be the next major technological breakthrough in the field of brain cancer diagnosis and therapy. In this work, we present the design and kinematic analysis of a flexible spring-based minimally invasive neurosurgical intracranial robot (MINIR-II). It is comprised of an inter-connected inner spring and an outer spring to enable motion in three dimensions (3D). Our design provides improved dexterity with higher degrees of freedom (DoFs) and independent joint control because of the centrally routed tendon configuration. Since the robot itself is made of plastic (except the electrocautery probes and SMA spring actuators), it is MRI-compatible and allows surgeons to track the real-time location of the robot in the brain and to reach the brain tumor target. The inter-connected spring and the outer spring are manufactured individually in a single piece using rapid prototyping technology at low cost to make it disposable after single use. Our three-segment robot has two DoFs at each segment with both joints controlled by two pairs of MRI-compatible SMA spring actuators. We also present a detailed kinematic analysis of the robot, simulation of the robot motion, and experimental evaluation of the robot motion using vision feedback.",

        "track": "main",
        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "Rendering forces to the user is one of the main goals of haptic technology. While most force-feedback interfaces are robotic manipulators, attached to a fixed frame and designed to exert forces on the users while being moved, more recent haptic research introduced two novel important ideas. On one side, cutaneous stimulation aims at rendering haptic stimuli at the level of the skin, with a distributed, rather than, concentrated approach. On the other side, wearable haptics focuses on highly portable and mobile devices, which can be carried and worn by the user as the haptic equivalent of an mp3 player. This paper presents a light and simple wearable device (CUFF) for the distributed mechano-tactile stimulation of the user's arm skin with pressure and stretch cues, related to normal and tangential forces, respectively. The working principle and the mechanical and control implementation of the CUFF device are presented. Then, after a basic functional validation, a first application of the device is shown, where it is used to render the grasping force of a robotic hand (the Pisa/IIT SoftHand). Preliminary results show that the device is capable to deliver in a reliable manner grasping force information, thus eliciting a good softness discrimination in users and enhancing the overall grasping experience.",

In this study, a stretchable strain sensor is proposed as a length sensor for a pneumatic artificial muscle. To measure the length of the artificial muscle, the stretchable strain sensor is required to have quick response characteristics. A capacitance measurement circuit based on a band-pass filter is analyzed, and is tuned by the parameters of its electric components. The circuit measures the capacitance of the strain sensor with accuracy equivalent to a commercially available LCR meter. We confirm that the combination of the capacitance meter and the strain sensor measures the length of the artificial muscle with a high sampling rate of 10 kHz.",

In order to realize such sensor systems, this paper considers acoustic information recognition from a hovering helicopter which a microphone array system. As the noise of rotors distorts the acoustic information, noise reduction is necessary. Since the rotor noise varies even at the hovering flight, an acoustic model of the rotor noise is derived taking the dynamics of the helicopter into account, and the model is utilized to evaluate the performance of the microphone array. The proposed approach was verified by evaluating the optimality of a real device that was empirically tuned in authors previous work, and the computed configuration of the microphone array and the developed one coincide well, which ensures the validity of the approach. As the validation through a practical application, the signal was processed by Delay-and-Sum Beam Former to localize the sound source. The system was able to find peaks of the power that corresponded to the sound source.",

This paper presents the design details of a novel upper limb rehabilitation robot named CASIA-ARM, which can assist poststroke patients to perform shoulder and elbow rehabilitation training in the horizontal plane, and provide both force and visual feedback to the patient: 1) A five-bar closed-chain structure is designed to realize a stiff and low-inertial mechanism. Workspace and singularity analysis is given, which guarantees that the workspace is large enough for upper limb moving and no singularity in the workspace. 2) Cable transmission, motor current controller and impedance control method guarantee the transparent and compliant interaction between the human and the robot. 3) Implementation examples of passive training based on position control and active training based on impedance control are presented in detail. 4) In order to evaluate the robot's applicability and performance, examples of trajectory tracking and active reaching tasks are used in this study, and the preliminary test results are also given (tracking error: 0.86\u00b10:42 mm, force control error: 1.41\u00b10.79 N in the X direction, and 1.22\u00b10.91 N in the Y direction).",

We propose a fully integrated, untethered robot capable of carrying sensors and maneuver into water pipe networks.

A prototype is built to demonstrate the basic elements of maneuverability, including following straight lines and making sharp turns.",

        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "Magnetic adhesion mechanism is commonly used in mobile robots design for inspection tasks of ferric structures. The magnetic adhesion force is generated either by Permanent Magnets (PMs) or Electro-Magnets (EMs). Both methods have intrinsic limitations: fixed magnetic force in PMs or a constant electric power supply in EMs. Work in this paper presents a novel active magnetic wheel design by implementing Electro- Permanent Magnet (EPM) technology in its adhesion mechanism. EPMs allow to control the magnetic force by simply applying a short electric pulse. Controlling the amplitude of the electrical pulse, the magnetic force can be set into a chosen value enabling a continuous variation of the magnetic adhesive force. Implementing EPMs in adhesion mechanism will impact significantly on the mobile robot when manoeuvring in complex structures, avoiding difficult obstacles and energy consumption, thus enhancing its performance. Simulations of the proposed wheel design are performed in order to demonstrate the behaviour of the active magnetic adhesion mechanism and its feasibility. An improved design of the actual wheel is presented based on results of initial simulations. Further designs are suggested by adapting the adhesion mechanism to existing wheel designs.",

In addition, a rescue mechanism is not needed in case of emergency such as the loss of power, communication and control. Besides, the 2-pitch joint of this joint module assists the in-pipe robot to pass through the miter and the branch safely and quickly. Finally, the performance of back-drivable joint module is experimentally validated.",

A lightweight tension amplifying mechanism that increases the joint stiffness in quadratic order is proposed. High stiffness is essential for precise and rapid manipulation, and low mass and inertia are important factors for safety due to low stored kinetic energy. The proposed tension amplifying mechanism was applied to a 1-DOF elbow joint and then extended to a 3-DOF wrist joint. The developed manipulator was analyzed in terms of inertia, stiffness, and strength properties. Its moving part weighs 3.37 kg, and its inertia is 0.57 kg\u00b7m2, which is similar to that of a human arm. The stiffness of the developed elbow joint is 1440Nm/rad, which is comparable to that of the joints with rigid components in industrial manipulators. A detailed description of the design is provided, and thorough analysis verifies the performance of the proposed mechanism.",

Each Active Cell is a single degree-of-freedom linear actuator (a \u201cmuscle unit\u201d), consisting of fiberglass end-pieces connecting two strands of Nitinol shape-memory alloy and a passive biasing spring. The Nitinol strands are coiled into a tight spring to increase deformations when activated through resistive heating. In-depth examination of the optimization of Nitinol coils with an antagonistic spring is presented, resulting in large repeatable axial cell strains of up to 25%. The design of these cellular muscle units to obtain maximal repeatable stroke is presented, allowing for the construction of larger networks of cells (MACRO modules, akin to a biological \u201ctissue\u201d) that can be customized to a target application. Finally, experimental demonstration of the construction and actuation of some simple MACRO modules is described.",

The robot is called FroBot, since its structure and locomotion are similar to frogs. Our inspiration comes from the frog scooter and breaststroke. Based on its swing leg mechanism, an unusual universal wheel structure is used to generate propulsion on land, while a pair of flexible caudal fins functions like the foot flippers of a frog to generate similar propulsion underwater. On the basis of the prototype design and the dynamic model of the robot, some locomotion control simulations and experiments were conducted for the purpose of adjusting the parameters that affect the propulsion of the robot. Finally, a series of underwater experiments were performed to verify the design feasibility of FroBot and the rationality of the control algorithm.",

We demonstrate the potential of our framework, by showing how it exhibits coherent behaviour without any inbuilt prior expectations regarding the experimental scenario. Current research in cognitive systems for social robots has suggested that automatic attention mechanisms are essential to social interaction. In fact, we hypothesise that enabling artificial cognitive systems with middleware implementing these mechanisms will empower robots to perform adaptively and with a higher degree of autonomy in complex and social environments. However, this type of assumption is yet to be convincingly and systematically put to the test. The ultimate goal will be to test our working hypothesis and the role of attention in adaptive, social robotics.",

In this paper, we seek to better understand requirements for such information gathering robots (InfoBots) from the perspective of the user requesting the information. We present findings from two studies: (i) a user survey conducted in two office buildings and (ii) a 4-day long deployment in one of the buildings, during which inhabitants of the building could ask questions to an InfoBot through a web-based interface. These studies allow us to characterize the types of information that InfoBots can provide for their users.",

Our approach leverages online estimated ego motion states and uses a novel inertial-optical flow (IOF) measurement analysis to identify moving objects and to characterize them in their angular and linear velocities. The novelty of our algorithm lies in the identification and segmentation of consistent optical flow outliers in the so-called kinematic space. These consistent outliers in combination with the IOF information for ego-motion estimation yield a first order estimation of the moving object in full 3D and in metric units. The approach is highly efficient as it only requires matched features in two consecutive images. We evaluate and demonstrate our algorithm in simulations and in real world tests.",

        "abstract": "Despite their ubiquitous presence, texture-less objects present significant challenges to contemporary visual object detection and localization algorithms. This paper proposes a practical method for the detection and accurate 3D localization of multiple texture-less and rigid objects depicted in RGB-D images. The detection procedure adopts the sliding window paradigm, with an efficient cascade-style evaluation of each window location. A simple pre-filtering is performed first, rapidly rejecting most locations. For each remaining location, a set of candidate templates (i.e. trained object views) is identified with a voting procedure based on hashing, which makes the method's computational complexity largely unaffected by the total number of known objects. The candidate templates are then verified by matching feature points in different modalities. Finally, the approximate object pose associated with each detected template is used as a starting point for a stochastic optimization procedure that estimates accurate 3D pose. Experimental evaluation shows that the proposed method yields a recognition rate comparable to the state of the art, while its complexity is sub-linear in the number of templates.",

Especially for robots navigating through different levels of a building, stair detection constitutes an important perception task. In this paper, we propose a stair detection algorithm using range data. Firstly, we introduce a parameter, which describes local surface orientations w.r.t. a global reference. Secondly, a matched filter is used to detect relevant edges in the orientation data. Afterwards, line segments are determined using these edge data which are further used to estimate stairs. The proposed method is invariant against rotations of the sensor. We show that the system can handle typical outdoor stair types and outperforms the accuracy of state-of-the-art stair detection methods. Moreover, the method is used in real time to assist visually impaired people who wear the camera system on a helmet.",

This paper proposes two methods for detecting continuous barking actions of SAR dogs, which locate victims by smell and then bark continuously to tell handlers where victims are located. Continuous barking action is detected from audio information and a dog's body motions. This detection method is based on dynamic time warping (DTW), which has been used successfully to analyze human audio information. Cyclic body motion was observed during dogs' barking motions. This cyclic motion can be detected by an inertial measurement unit (IMU) attached to the vest. A fast Fourier transform (FFT) is used to analyze a dog's barking motion. The proposed detection methods were evaluated using audio and IMU data recorded during actual SAR dog training sessions. The F-scores of the audio and motion-based barking detection methods were 0.95 and 0.90, respectively. As a trial, we marked victim locations on a map based on the body motion.",

        "abstract": "Monte Carlo localization (MCL) is a sample-based approach for representing probability density for the pose of a robot. MCL is widely used for mobile robots because of its robustness with respect to sensor noise. On the other hand, MCL can fail to estimate a pose of a robot if objects block measuring range of a laser sensor of the robot. Even though MCL fails to estimate the pose of the robot, MCL does not stop to estimate the pose because MCL does not have a self-diagnostic function. Therefore, detection of localization failure is essential for a mobile robot application. In the present paper, we propose a novel approach that detects the localization failure of MCL through logistic regression. The proposed approach has two advantages. First, it can detect whether position errors is larger than 0.15 m with a high accuracy. Second, the proposed method can detect localization failure by means of a statistically modeled equation. Moreover, as an example of an application using the probability of localization failure, we have proposed a hybrid localization scheme with MCL and laser odometry. The practical effectiveness of the proposed scheme is verified through experiments.",

        "abstract": "Recent studies revealed that hand gesture-based interfaces can complement therapies for individuals with upper motor impairments and reduce the need of traditional rehabilitation sessions through hospital visits. Unfortunately, existing gesture-based interfaces have been developed without considering the physical limitations of users with motor impairments. An analytic approach was presented in our previous work to convert existing gesture-based interfaces designed for able-bodied individuals to be usable by individuals with quadriplegia using the Laban Theory of Movement. This paper extends the previous work by including gesture variability analysis (based on Uncontrolled Manifolds theory) and robotic execution. A WAM robotic arm was used to mimic gesture trajectories and a physical metric was empirically obtained to evaluate the physical effort of each gesture. At last, an integration method was presented to determine the accessible gesture set based on both the stability and empirical robot execution. For all the gesture classes, the accessible gestures were found to lie within 31% of the optimality of stability and work, respectively.",

        "abstract": "Incorporating the body dynamics of compliant robots into their controller architectures can drastically reduce the complexity of locomotion control. An extreme version of this embodied control principle was demonstrated in highly compliant tensegrity robots, for which stable gait generation was achieved by using only optimized linear feedback from the robot's sensors to its actuators. The morphology of quadrupedal robots has previously been used for sensing and for control of a compliant spine, but never for gait generation. In this paper, we successfully apply embodied control to the compliant, quadrupedal Oncilla robot. As initial experiments indicated that mere linear feedback does not suffice, we explore the minimal requirements for robust gait generation in terms of memory and nonlinear complexity. Our results show that a memoryless feedback controller can generate a stable trot by learning the desired nonlinear relation between the input and the output signals. We believe this method can provide a very useful tool for transferring knowledge from open loop to closed loop control on compliant robots.",

Through functional analysis of each human joint, two DOFs were composed of active joints using an electric motor developed in an under-actuated form with heightened efficiency. The rest of the DOFs were composed of passive or quasi-passive joints to imitate human joints. The control of the exoskeleton robot was based on the physical human-robot interaction. In order to verify the performance of the developed HEXAR-CR50, muscle activity was measured using electromyography, vGRF was measured using F-Scan sensor. The experimental results showed that %MVIC was reduced against the external load applied, while GRF had a decrement rate, compared with the external load when the exoskeleton was worn, which verified the performance in accordance with the development objective of load carrying. A muscle strength augment effect from the developed wearable robot was verified.",

        "abstract": "Sewer pipes play an important role in a city's infrastructure. However, accidents have occurred in recent years due to increasingly old pipes. To prevent such accidents, there is a need to check the internal condition of pipes. Therefore, we focused on the locomotion of a robotic earthworm that is capable of running stably in a narrow space. We developed a peristalsis crawling robot with the goal of traveling 100 m through a 100A pipe. The robot is composed of six unit sections, five joints, and a head section to which the inspection camera is attached. It uses an artificial muscle operated by air pressure. In this study, we developed a new joint to reduce buckling, increase the running speed, and decrease the unit size. Further, we developed a new head section that allowed passage through a 90\u00b0 elbow pipe. We evaluated the effectiveness of the new robot, and conducted running experiments in horizontal, vertical, and two types of bent pipes.",

        "track": "main",
        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "Conventional hybrid actuators can achieve a better force/torque bandwidth than a single principle actuator without losing back-drivability. However, hybrid actuators occupy space at least equal to the sum of the volumes of two or more actuators and multiple transmissions consisting of timing belts, gears, links, tendons, or Bowden-cables. Designs in which space and structural elements of a hybrid actuator are integrated have not been sufficiently studied. This paper presents an original development work on the design of an integrated pneumatic-electromagnetic hybrid linear actuator (iPEHLA). In the integrated design, hybrid components of an air cylinder and a linear motor were arranged around a single shaft, and the pneumatic and electromagnetic actuators shared the same moving parts (i.e., piston and moving part) and internal cylindrical spaces (i.e., cylinder and stator). Consequently, space required was less than the sum of the volumes of the two actuators. To verify the feasibility of this novel integrated design, the iPEHLA was designed and prototyped by modifying parts of a commercially available pneumatic cylinder integrated with electromagnetic components. The performances of the iPEHLA under pneumatic actuation and hybrid actuation were compared with respect to a feedforward friction compensation. The experimental results demonstrated that the novel design maintained its hybrid properties.",

Such a master-slave robot hand system can be effective from a viewpoint of usability. However, conventional systems are not able to adapt to dynamically changing environments because they have high latency from input to output. Therefore, we developed a fast-response master-slave robot hand system using a high-speed vision system and a high-speed robot hand. The latency of the proposed system is so small that humans cannot recognize it. The motion of a human hand is obtained with high-speed non-contact 3D sensing, and this motion is mapped to a high-speed robot hand, while taking account of structural differences between the human hand and the robot hand. We confirmed the effectiveness of our proposed system through experiments.",

        "abstract": "Falling is a common problem in the growing elderly population and fall-risk assessment systems are needed for community-based fall prevention program. In particular, gait measurements such as several-meters walk tests are carried out in community health activities. To evaluate the walking ability of the participant, it is necessary to measure foot contact positions so that the walking parameters such as stride length can be used for fall-risk assessment. However, the conventional measurement systems are difficult to install for use in community health activities because of their scale, cost and constraints of the measurement range. Therefore, we propose a gait measurement robot (GMR) using laser range sensor (LRS) for a long-distance walk tests. From the experimental results with young people, it was confirmed that the GMR could measure the both leg trajectory and the foot contact positions. However, in the case of the elderly especially, a false tracking is likely to occur due to the narrow stride. In addition, the GMR calculates the foot contact positions by analyzing the estimated position and speed of each leg. In the case of the elderly, there is a possibility that the GMR cannot detect the foot contact correctly because the walking speed is likely to be slow. In this study, we carry out the seven-meter straight walk tests with the elderly people using a stationary LRS for the advance verification of measurement in the elderly with the GMR. We verify the leg tracking and foot contact detection using a stationary LRS in the elderly compared with the video analysis.",

        "abstract": "The main goal of this paper is to design and evaluate a spine structure which withstands various motions. The structure around the neck has a prevailing importance since it is involved in various motions of the upper half of the body. The new design method we introduce essentially shows how to design all 7 cervical vertebrae (the part of spine in the neck) in a limited space, actuated by the wires winded around the motors. Then we show the muscle arrangements around the upper half of the spine. More specifically, we make use of a so called planar muscle mechanism. An abduction experiment which requires great force around the spine is made to show its stability. Finally, we show a variable stiffness system which enables the spine to resist an impulsive force. We have tested the system in the situation of whiplash injury which is a case of extreme external forces which can occur in car crash accidents. As such we have evaluated the strength of the design and the viability of our robot to act as a human body simulator.",

QRoSS is a transformable robot that can store its legs in the spherical shell. The shell not only absorbs external forces from all directions, but also improves mobile performance because of its round shape. In rescue operations at a disaster site, carrying robots into a site is dangerous for operators because doing so may result in a second accident. If QRoSS is used, instead of carrying robots in, they are thrown in, making the operation safe and easy. We developed QRoSS-I and conducted basic experiments to verify performance which includes landing, rising and walking through a series of movements. This paper reports details of a mechanical design to perform a rotational locomotion using spherical shell and development of the prototype model of QRoSS-II. We discuss the rising motion and the rotational locomotion from the results of Basic experiments.",

        "abstract": "Within the limbs of typical animals, there exist bi-articular muscles crossing two joints. It is known that the bi-articular muscles of the felid play an important role in the locomotion. Also the muscle-tendon complex, composed of the gastrocnemius muscle and the Achilles' tendon that cross the knee joint and the ankle joint contributes much to the movements such as running and jumping particularly. Besides, because the muscle-tendon complex has the function for absorbing shocking, it is utilized for soft landing from high places. To achieve high performance for jumping and landing motion like cats, we are developing robot legs inspired by the bi-articular muscle-tendon complex of cats. The leg consists of hip, knee and ankle joints. For the knee and ankle joints, a four-bar linkage mechanism with one elastic linkage, in which the knee joint is driven by an electric rotary motor and the ankle joint is passive, is applied. By this mechanism, basic functions of the bi-articular muscle-tendon complex of felids like cats can be realized and the performance for jumping and landing can be improved. In this paper, the new leg mechanism is described. Moreover, a prototype of a pair of the hind legs of the quadruped robot using the new mechanism has been developed. The results of jumping and landing experiments are shown to validate the effectiveness of the mechanism.",

The mud-including mineral resources and marine sediments are potentially valuable resources for future studies. Therefore, we propose a peristaltic-crawling-based sub-seafloor excavation robot for deep sea exploration. This robot consists of three units (propulsion, excavation and extraction units), enabling it to move freely through mud. The excavation and propulsion units are fitted with an earth auger and artificial muscles, respectively. In this paper, we verify the propulsion actuator as the first stage of robot development. First, we evaluate the performance of an oil hydraulic artificial muscle under water pressure. Next, we develop an excavation robot by incorporating a pneumatic artificial muscle into a robot and then experimentally evaluate propulsion and excavation of the robot.

In particular, the purpose of helping the operation of the cells under a microscope, many research related to micro manipulation techniques with robotic technology has been proposed. In such background, we studied two finger micro hand that realized control of the sub-micro order size object. The accurate operation of the end effector against the object by the micro hand is demanded to users. To reduce the burden, we focus on making the manipulation easy. User can perform micro manipulation with rough operation by using the actuator that varies in size. Since the actuator fills space between the end effectors and the object. Then we focus on the gel that varies in size. In this paper, we evaluate the gel that varies in size. Then we propose the manipulation that take advantage of the gel.",

        "abstract": "Dexterous object manipulation with robotic hands (subject to holonomic constraints) usually requires the capacity of fingertips to roll onto the object, which is very difficult to achieve with frictionless point contact model . As an alternative, deformable contact model has been considered based on hemispherical shape end-effector to yield rolling. However, it entails dexterity at the expense of dealing with normal and tangential forces, as well as more elaborated dynamic models. In this paper, a passivity-based controller is proposed for redundant robotic fingers with hemi-spherical deformable fingertips to manipulate dexterously a circular dynamic object. Redundancy and rolling are exploited to control normal and tangent contact forces to yield an optimal grasping. The optimal grasping is based on to align dynamically the normal forces applied to the object that allow its manipulation with minimum tangent forces. Stability conditions are presented to guarantee local asymptotic convergence. Finally, numerical simulations show the performance of the forces toward desired pose. This approach can be extended to objects with arbitrary shape that admit a local decomposition by a circular curvature.",

More sophisticated tools such as grippers are fragile, expensive and non-dexterous. This paper addresses some of the main challenges of manipulation at the micrometer scale, including robots with limited degrees of freedom, small range of available tools and open-loop control due to a lack of position sensors. This work presents a preliminary investigation into the viability of using the Direct Laser Writing and Two-Photon Polymerization microfabrication techniques for creating flexible micrometer-scale end-effectors. A novel compliant end-effector design is presented for closed-chain cooperative manipulation involving multiple micromanipulator robots. A visual servoing framework was also developed to allow the user to control the robots in a closed loop manner, with haptic feedback to help match the user's input to the speed of the robots. Characterization of the new compliant manipulator was conducted and multi-robot configurations were tested to demonstrate the flexibility, robustness and increased workspace of the new design for both 2D and 3D object manipulation tasks.",

        "abstract": "Methods of optimizing a single trajectory are mature enough for planning in many applications. Yet such optimization methods applied to high Degree-Of-Freedom robots either consume too much time to be real-time or approximate the dynamics such that they lack physical consistency. In this paper, we present a method of precomputing optimized trajectories and compressing the information to get a compact representation of the optimal policy function. By varying the initial configuration of a robot and optimizing multiple trajectories, the controller gains knowledge about the optimal policy function. Such computation can be performed on a powerful workstation or even supercomputers instead of an onboard computer of the robot. The precomputed optimal trajectories are stored in a Single-hidden Layer Feedforward neural Network (SLFN) using Optimally Pruned Extreme Learning Machine (OP-ELM). This ensures minimal representation of the model and fast evaluation of the SLFN. We first explain our method using a simple time-optimal control problem with an analytical solution. We then demonstrate how this method can work even for high dimensional state by optimizing a foothold strategy of a full quadruped robot in simulation.",

        "abstract": "Efficient obstacle detection is a key requirement for safe robot navigation. We consider the operation of autonomous vehicles in structured industrial environments. In such scenarios, an usual way to perform obstacle detection is to generate an estimate of the ground and detect elements that are on the path of the vehicle, using the ground as a spatial reference. For this task, 3D occupancy grids are a well-know solution. In this work we extrapolate the concept of 3D grids by considering a discrete-continuous representation of the environment. The discrete nature lies in a 2D grid parallel to the ground whereas the continuous aspect represents the height of each cell in the grid. This framework allows for very efficient clustering, for which we also propose a novel algorithm to cluster potential obstacles. Experiments on an autonomous ground vehicle illustrate the applicability of the method.",

This estimate is, then, used both to compute its local control input and isolate faulty teammates, even in absence of direct communication with them. For diagnosis purposes, a set of residual vectors, each of them sensible to a fault occurring on a single vehicle, is designed and an adaptive threshold is derived in order to avoid false alarms. The approach is validated via numerical simulations involving 4 vehicles moving in formation in a 3D environment.",

Using a Kinect depth camera, surface changes, induced by a simple pushing motion, are recorded and used as input to nearest neighbour and polynomial regression classification models. Results reveal that even when the classifier is trained on a relatively small dataset it generalises well to unknown containers and liquid fill rates. Furthermore, the regression model allows us to determine the approximate viscosity of unknown liquids.",

To this end, we introduce a novel method based on randomized clustering trees to learn visual vocabularies which are fast to compute and more discriminative compared to the vocabularies generated by classical methods such as k-means. We show that, when combined with standard spatial pooling strategies, our proposed approach yields a powerful feature representation for RGB-D object recognition. Our extensive experimental evaluation on two challenging RGB-D object datasets and live video streams from Kinect shows that our learned features result in superior object recognition accuracies compared with the state-of-the-art methods.",

        "abstract": "The recent focus on performing visual navigation and place recognition in changing environments has resulted in a large number of heterogeneous techniques each utilizing their own learnt or hand crafted visual features. This paper presents a generally applicable method for learning the appropriate distance metric by which to compare feature responses from any of these techniques in order to perform place recognition under changing environmental conditions. We implement an approach which learns to cluster images captured at spatially proximal locations under different conditions, separated from frames captured at different places. The formulation is a convex optimization, guaranteeing the existence of a global solution. We evaluate the general applicability of our method on two benchmark change datasets using three typical image pre-processing and feature types: GIST, Principal Component Analysis and learnt Convolutional Neural Network features. The results demonstrate that the distance metric learning approach uniformly improves single-image-based visual place recognition performance across all feature types. Furthermore, we demonstrate that this performance improvement is maintained when the sequence-based algorithm SeqSLAM is applied to the single-image place recognition results, leading to state-of-the-art performance.",

        "abstract": "In this article we address the automatic synthesis of controllers for the coordinated movement of multiple mobile robots, as a canonical example of cooperative robotic behavior. We use five distributed noise-resistant variations of Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) to learn in simulation a set of 50 weights of an artificial neural network. They differ on the way the particles are allocated and evaluated on the robots, and on how the PSO neighborhood is implemented. In addition, we use a centralized approach that allows for benchmarking with the distributed versions. Regardless of the learning approach, each robot measures locally and individually the performance of the group using exclusively on-board resources. Results show that four of the distributed variations obtain similar fitnesses as the centralized version, and are always able to learn. The other distributed variation fails to properly learn on some of the runs, and results in lower fitness when it succeeds. We test systematically the controllers learned in simulation in real robot experiments.",

We propose a set of local continuous algorithms that together produce a generalization of a Euclidean Steiner tree. At any stage, the resulting overall shape achieves a good compromise between local thickness, global connectivity, and flexibility to further continuous motion of the terminals. The resulting swarm behavior scales well, is robust against node failures, and performs close to the best known approximation bound for a corresponding centralized static optimization problem.",

        "abstract": "Teams of fixed wing micro-aerial vehicles (MAVs) could provide a wide area coverage and relay data in wireless ad-hoc networks. In such applications fixed wing MAVs have to be able to regulate an inter-robot distance. Fixed wing MAVs have reduced maneuverability, that is, they cannot perform sharp turns or hover on the spot. This kinematic property presents the main challenge to design a formation algorithm that will regulate inter-MAV distance and cover the desired area. In this paper we present a distributed control strategy that is based on attraction and repulsion between MAVs and relies only on local information. We show in simulation and in field experiments with a team of fixed wing MAVs that using our strategy MAVs can cover an area by creating an equilateral triangular lattice and regulate communication link quality between neighboring MAVs.",

In this paper we propose an infrastructure-free distributed control method for multiple flying cameras tracking a moving object. The proposed vision-based servoing can deal with noisy and missing target observations, accounts for quadrotor oscillations and does not require an external positioning system. The flight direction of each camera is inferred via geometric derivation, and the formation is maintained by employing a distributed algorithm that uses the target position information on the camera plane and the position of neighboring flying cameras. Simulations show that the proposed solution enables the tracking of a moving target by the cameras flying in formation despite noisy target detections and when the target is outside some of the fields of view.",

We devised a mechanism that connected two bicopter modules, each of which combines two of the four propellers into one set and named this mechanism the \u201cBi2 Copter\u201d. This mechanism provided movements including landing, take-off, and flying with any desired tilt angle. This ability of this mechanism to fly walls with continuously changing surface angles and full 360\u00b0 spherical coverage makes possible applications in investigation, measurement, etc. This report covers the design concepts of this flying robot, the structure design, basic control and operations verification.",

        "abstract": "In this paper, a dual-mode twisting actuation mechanism with an active clutch is newly presented for a high performance tendon-driven robot (e.g., robot hand). This mechanism is a kind of mechanical automatic power transmission mechanism which provides fast motion and large contraction force by two geared motors. One of the motors is adopted for main actuation and the other is utilized for active clutch. The active clutch consisting of low-power DC motor and gear set allows easy control of the dual-mode twisting actuation and simplifies relaxation process of twisted strings which was a critical problem by a passive brake in previous research [17]. Kinematics of the proposed mechanism is represented and its simulation is performed to verify the performance numerically. By using BLDC & DC motor with 8 W & 0.3 W power, we developed a prototype of the dual-mode twisting actuation with the weight of 45.7 g and the size of 71 mm \u00d7 21.5 \u00d7 15 mm. Despite of simple structure, the proposed mechanism shows that operation mode-change can be easily managed and the relaxation time was much more reduced than that of the passive brake version.",

The Dynamic Bandwidth Management Library (DBML) was designed to provide a way of maximizing bandwidth usage in multi-robots systems. The developed system prioritizes communication channels according to environment events and offers greater bandwidth for the most important channels. The library was developed in ROS (Robot Operating System) in order to separate the functionalities into independent modules to be reused and improved in future works. This paper presents the library design as a linear optimization problem and an example of the library usage in a teleoperation application.

        "abstract": "In this paper we derive and implement an algorithm for an indoor mobile robotics platform to estimate the manipulability of initially unknown obstacles while navigating through its environment to a pre-specified goal. The environment is represented by an evidence grid, where each cell contains a gamma-distributed cost as well as visual feature data in the form of a color histogram. While navigating, the robot associates visual features of objects occupying a given cell with manipulability cost estimates of that cell, learning whether an object or obstacle can be moved or not in the robot's attempt to reach the goal. We derive and utilize a lower confidence bound (LCB) estimate for the cost of each cell in order to incorporate an exploration (versus pure exploitation) element to the robot's search for the lowest-cost path. Combining the LCB cost estimates with the dynamic replanning search algorithm D*-Lite, we can quickly compute optimal navigation paths regardless of the numerous changes occurring in the robot's environmental belief state. We explain the probabilistic representation of cost in the evidence grid and provide simulation and real-world results for our algorithm in a navigation scenario with static and movable objects.",

        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "Dividing the control authority of the slave robot among operators, based on the available information to them and their controlling strategy, is absolutely essential for cooperative teleoperation systems. Although there have been many studies on this, most of the analysis were limited to fixed authority and its effect on stability. None of the research has discussed how to allocate the control authority in real-time. This paper presents a dynamic authority distribution method for dual master single slave Cooperative Teleoperation systems, which allocates the authority over slave to operators on the move in each DOF separately. This method observes the energy interaction in the kinesthetic coupling link between the operators, classifies the interaction into operators' leader/follower behavior and adapts the authorities accordingly. The proposed method is experimentally tested with unique set of camera views of task environment with 3DOF dual master single slave teleoperation system. Experimental results demonstrate accurate convergence of decomposition of authorities based on camera-view. The performance of proposed dynamic authority architecture is evaluated by comparing total energy generation with fixed authority setup, and is found to be more efficient in terms of less energy generation, and hence less effort is required by operators to execute the task.",

        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "Image based reconstruction of urban environments is a challenging problem that deals with optimization of large number of variables, and has several sources of errors like the presence of dynamic objects. Since most large scale approaches make the assumption of observing static scenes, dynamic objects are relegated to the noise modelling section of such systems. This is an approach of convenience since the RANSAC based framework used to compute most multiview geometric quantities for static scenes naturally confine dynamic objects to the class of outlier measurements. However, reconstructing dynamic objects along with the static environment helps us get a complete picture of an urban environment. Such understanding can then be used for important robotic tasks like path planning for autonomous navigation, obstacle tracking and avoidance, and other areas. In this paper, we propose a system for robust SLAM that works in both static and dynamic environments. To overcome the challenge of dynamic objects in the scene, we propose a new model to incorporate semantic constraints into the reconstruction algorithm. While some of these constraints are based on multi-layered dense CRFs trained over appearance as well as motion cues, other proposed constraints can be expressed as additional terms in the bundle adjustment optimization process that does iterative refinement of 3D structure and camera / object motion trajectories. We show results on the challenging KITTI urban dataset for accuracy of motion segmentation and reconstruction of the trajectory and shape of moving objects relative to ground truth. We are able to show average relative error reduction by 41 % for moving object trajectory reconstruction relative to state-of-the-art methods like TriTrack[16], as well as on standard bundle adjustment algorithms with motion segmentation.",

        "abstract": "Applying humanoid robots in disaster sites requires strong locomotion abilities due to the cluttered and unstructured environment. Besides bipedal walking, it is beneficial to provide functionality to locomote on four limbs, and to control the transitions between bipedal and quadrupedal locomotion. In this paper, we propose a planning algorithm for bipedal and quadrupedal locomotion with intermediate transitions. The algorithm is based on the divergent component of motion for a linear time-variant inverted pendulum model with variable height and a flywheel. The model was validated by model comparisons in a simulation experiment. In addition, the algorithm was validated on a real robot, which realized a sequence of bipedal and quadrupedal locomotion without intermediate stops.",

The desired wrench needs to be suitably distributed between the end-effectors to implement the desired motion of the manipulated object. In this framework, both the grasp kinematics and the individual capacities of each manipulator provide relevant constraints. On one hand, the end effector wrenches act on the object via the grasp geometry. On the other hand, the individual admissible payload further depends on the current configuration of the robots. In this paper we focus on a heterogeneous cooperative manipulation setting and we design a proper allocation strategy to distribute the desired object wrench, considering both constant and time-varying constraints for the load distribution. The relevance of our findings is illustrated by means of an experimental study involving two anthropomorphic robots manipulating a common object.",

Robotic fins typically comprise a number of serially arranged and individually actuated \u201cfin rays\u201d, interconnected by a membrane-like flexible surface. Propulsive forces are generated by the propagation of a traveling wave along the mechanism, via appropriately timed ray oscillations. The present paper describes a dynamic model for an elementary two-ray fin system, analyzed as a standard robot mechanism with additional contributions arising from the elastic deformation of the flexible membrane and from the hydrodynamic forces. The model's main aspects, particularly with regard to the hydrodynamic effects, are explored via simulation studies, as well as via experiments with a robotic prototype. The developed model can serve a number of purposes towards optimizing the mechanical design, the control strategies, and the propulsive efficacy of robotic undulatory fins.",

        "abstract": "In this article, we build dynamic models of 2D compliant links to evaluate injury level in a human-robot interaction. Safety is a premium concern for co-robotic systems. It has been studied that using compliant links in a robot can greatly reduce the injury level. Since most safety criteria are based on tolerance of acceleration of the operator's head during the impact, an efficient and yet accurate dynamic model of compliant links is needed. In this paper, we compare three dynamic models for calculating acceleration and head injury criterion: the compliant Beam-Spring-Mass (BSM) model, the Mass-Spring-Mass (MSM) model and the Link-Spring-Mass (LSM) model. For the MSM model and LSM model, we obtain analytic expressions of acceleration. While numerical results are achieved for the compliant BSM model. To develop the compliant BSM model, we compared three different methods: the Pseudo-Rigid-Body (PRB) model, the Finite-Segment-Model (FSM), and the Assumed-Mode-Method (AMM). Finally, all these models are validated by human-robot impact simulation programs built in Matlab. The acceleration from these simulations can be used to quantitatively measure the injury level during an impact.",

To optimize the design of such PKM, only kinetostatic analysis is not sufficient. Additionally, dynamic properties should be taken into account. Hence, this research develops the dynamic model for a class of translational 3-RPC-manipulators with either pure prismatic joint or pure revolute joint actuation. For a given task the dynamic performance is compared to results of the kinetostatic analysis. Hence, it is shown that the dynamic properties highly influence the performance of the RPC-structure.",

However, there has not been much work on autonomous control algorithms for microscale robots in microfluidic environments. In this paper, we introduce an autonomous navigation algorithm for the bacteria-powered microrobots (BPMs) in a workspace with moving obstacles. A BPM consists of a rigid inorganic body with bacteria attached on the surface. The attached bacteria provide propulsive force and are controllable using electric fields, which had been demonstrated in previous work. We take the controllability of BPMs and the unpredictable motion of dynamic obstacles into account to develop a dynamic obstacle avoidance approach. Moreover, we use finite element simulation to observe an electric field around a moving obstacle to model the field's deformation. Demonstration of dynamic obstacle avoidance approach through simulation results and experimental data are presented in the paper.",

        "abstract": "Robots are often used to perform similar tasks on vastly different scales. When utilizing traditional design approaches, this typically requires a full redesign and optimization at each specified size, a costly and time intensive process. In this work, we propose an alternative approach based on the principle of dynamic similarity. With this method, an initial design may be conceived at any size and scaled to any other without needing to re-optimize either physical or control variables. In the following study, we derive a generalized scaling method for this application that not only preserves system performance, but also affords flexibility in the scaling process. The preservation of dynamic similarity is validated in simulation. We further explore the application for robot-to-robot scaling, flexibility afforded by an additional free parameter, and the implications of scaling on both power requirements and structural loading. With these insights, we provide an improved methodology for the efficient and cost-effective development of scaled robotic systems.",

        "abstract": "Quadrupedal locomotion on sloped terrains poses different challenges than walking in a mostly flat environment. The robot's configuration needs to be explicitly controlled in order to avoid slipping and kinematic limits. To this end, information about the terrain's inclination is required for carefully planning footholds, the pose of the main body, and modulation of the ground reaction forces. This is even more important for dynamic trotting, as only two support legs are available to compensate for gravity and drive a desired motion. We propose a reliable method for estimating the parameters of the terrain quadrupedal robots move on, in the face of limited perception capabilities and drifting robot pose estimates. By fusing inertial measurements, kinematic data from joint encoders and contact information from force sensors, the local inclination can be robustly estimated and used to optimize the contact forces to reduce slippage. The estimated terrain information, namely the pitch and roll angles of the ground plane, is exploited in an extended version of our previous model-based control approach. Our improved control framework enabled StarlETH, a medium-sized, fully autonomous, torque-controllable quadrupedal robot, to trot on slopes of up to 21\u00b0.",

        "abstract": "Modern simulations feature crowds of AI-controlled agents moving through dynamic environments, with obstacles appearing or disappearing at run-time. A dynamic navigation mesh can represent the traversable space of such environments. The A* algorithm computes optimal paths through the dual graph of this mesh. When an obstacle is inserted or deleted, the mesh changes and agents should re-plan their paths. Many existing re-planning algorithms are too memory-intensive for crowds, or they cannot easily be used on graphs where vertices and edges are added or removed. In this paper, we present Dynamically Pruned A* (DPA*), an extension of A* for re-planning optimal paths in dynamic navigation meshes. DPA* has similarities to adaptive algorithms that make the A* heuristic more informed based on previous queries. However, DPA* prunes the search using only the previous path and its relation to the dynamic event. We describe the four re-planning scenarios that can occur; DPA* uses different rules in each scenario. Our algorithm is memory-friendly and robust against structural changes in the graph, which makes it suitable for crowds in dynamic navigation meshes. Experiments show that DPA* performs particularly well in complex environments and when the dynamic event is visible to the agent. We integrate the algorithm into crowd simulation software to model large crowds in dynamic environments in real-time.",

In this paper, we studied the effect of vibrotactile cues for guiding procedural motion of two joints on human's upper limbs. By mounting eight vibrotactile motors on two arms, we performed two experiments to measure human's perception and motor performance in response to the vibrotactile commands. In the first experiment, we measured perceptual performance of correctly identifying the location of two active vibrotactile cues. The difference between sustained, pulsed and hybrid vibration conditions was compared. To explore the possible reasons leading to the wrong perception results, the correct rate was ranked among different combinations of cues. In the second experiment, the correct rate of procedural motion control of two joints was measured, while vibrotactile cues were used as guidance signals to produce the motion command. The results showed that average correct rate of two cues localization on upper limbs was as high as 98%, while the average correct rate of procedural motion control of two joints was only 86%. Further analysis revealed that low correct rate of procedural motion control was caused by the unnatural motion pattern, i.e. two joints on a same arm and rotate in opposite directions.",

        "abstract": "We propose a method for realizing effective dynamic motion learning in a flexible-joint robot using motor babbling. Flexible-joint robots have recently attracted attention because of their adaptiveness, safety, and, in particular, dynamic motions. It is difficult to control robots that require dynamic motion. In past studies, attractors and oscillators were designed as motion primitives of an assumed task in advance. However, it is difficult to adapt to unintended environmental changes using such methods. To overcome this problem, we use a recurrent neural network (RNN) that does not require predetermined parameters. In this research, we propose a method for facilitating effective learning. First, a robot learns simple motions via motor babbling, acquiring body dynamics using a recurrent neural network (RNN). Motor babbling is the process of movement that infants use to acquire their own body dynamics during their early days. Next, the robot learns additional motions required for a target task using the acquired body dynamics. For acquiring these body dynamics, the robot uses motor babbling with its redundant flexible joints to learn motion primitives. This redundancy implies that there are numerous possible motion patterns. In comparison to a basic learning task, the motion primitives are simply modified to adjust to the task. Next, we focus on the types of motions used in motor babbling. We classify the motions into two motion types, passive motion and active motion. Passive motion involves inertia without any torque input, whereas active motion involves a torque input. The robot acquires body dynamics from the passive motion and a means of torque generation from the active motion. As a result, we demonstrate the importance of performing prior learning via motor babbling before learning a task. In addition, task learning is made more efficient by dividing the motion into two types of motor babbling patterns.",

        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "In retinal microsurgery, membrane peeling is a standard procedure requiring the delamination of a thin fibrous membrane adherent to the retina surface by applying very small forces. Robotic devices with combined force-sensing instruments have significant potential to assist this procedure by facilitating membrane delamination through induced micro-vibrations. However, defining the optimal frequency and amplitude for generating such vibrations, and updating these parameters during the procedure is not trivial. Automatic adjustment of these parameters via an adaptive control scheme is possible only if the individual parameter effects on delamination behavior are known. This study presents an experimental exploration of how micro-vibration amplitude and frequency affect membrane peeling forces alone. Combining a micromanipulator and a force-sensing micro-forceps, several peeling experiments were done on artificial phantoms (bandages) and inner shell membrane of raw chicken eggs. In the tested range of micro-vibration frequencies (10\u201350 Hz) the average delamination force was minimized mostly at 30 Hz for the bandages and at 50 Hz for the egg membranes. Increasing the micro-vibration amplitude from 50 \u00b5m up to 150 \u00b5m provided further reduction in average force, thus facilitated membrane delamination.",

For the evaluation to be useful, the Next Best View computation itself must be effective in terms of time and accuracy. It needs to be model-free to hold for any geometry of the 3D scene. In this work, we compare the effectiveness of different approaches to Next Best View evaluation. A 3D occupancy grid map, allowing for fast lookup and ray casting, serves as a foundation for our evaluation. We tested naive, state-of-the-art and novel algorithms on data acquired from both indoor and outdoor environments. We demonstrate that the most effective volumetric algorithm is a novel one that exploits spatial hierarchy, utilizes frontiers, and avoids redundant ray casting.",

Simultaneously, he perceives hip joint angles through an electric stimulation device of the controller. This paper introduces a walking robot which simulates the patient body with lofstrand crutches on his arms for preliminary experiments before a clinical trial. The finger-mounted walk controller is used to control a position of the robot's swing leg. A 5-meter walk experiment is conducted to evaluate feasibility of the controller. We confirmed that the user controlled a stride based only on the electric stimulation feedback and no visual feedback, and that the robot finished walking 5-meter in three minutes.",

The 60 kg robot features electromechanical linear series elastic actuators (SEAs), enabling low-impedance control of each joint in the lower body via linear to rotary and parallel mechanisms. We present a distributed joint impedance control framework that leverages a custom dual-axis motor controller to track position, velocity, and torque setpoints for each pair of joints. The required actuator forces are tracked using an inner force control loop combining feedforward and PID control with a model-based disturbance observer (DOB). Unlike previous approaches, we utilize an inverse plant model based on the open-loop actuator dynamics to simplify tuning of the cascaded controller by decoupling DOB estimates from the inner loop gains. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is verified through trajectory tracking and dynamic walking experiments conducted on the THOR humanoid utilizing a complementary optimization-based whole-body controller.",

The contribution of this paper is a generic model that integrates various stimuli to build a representation of reachable and comfort areas used to control robot behavior. Such an architecture is tested is three experiments using real robot and simulations. It is compared with two altered architecture versions. We show how our model allow the robot to solve various tasks, display emotionally colored behaviors and account for results from psychological studies.",

        "abstract": "The shortage of physicians afflicting developed countries encourages engineers and doctors to collaborate towards the development of telemedicine. In particular, robotic systems have the potential for helping doctors making examination. A very common examination that can be the goal of a robotic system is palpation. Most of the robotics systems that have been developed for palpation present interesting features such as integrating augmented reality environments or allowing for hand free interaction. In this paper we present a novel palpation system that allows us to perform virtual palpation of real objects by means of a haptic and an augmented reality feedback. This system features an encountered-type haptic interface in which the haptic feedback is calculated by a collision detection algorithm that is based on online recording of the surface to be touched. The system allows the users to remove their hand from the haptic interface end-effector that follows the user's hand thanks to the tracking performed by a Leap Motion. We show that the system provides a natural interaction during the contact-non contact switch, a suitable force during indentation, and it allows to discriminate objects within the body through the haptic channel.",

        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "Often times in multi-target, Unmanned Aerial System (UAS) applications, minimizing energy consumption is a common goal. In simplified cases, this problem can be solved by minimizing the path length between targets using the Traveling Salesman Problem with Neighborhoods (TSPN). However, this method does not take into account the attitude of the UAS. In addition, minimum path length does not always correlate to minimum energy consumption. This research proposes an approach to both problems. A method is proposed to more accurately model multi-target, six-rotor aircraft missions using the Generalized TSPN (GTSPN), which can account for the non-convex characteristics of the neighborhoods created by accounting for variable attitude. To address the energy consumption problem, a heuristic procedure is proposed to solve GTSPN instances using a genetic algorithm approach that incorporates a fine-tuned, dynamic model of a six-rotor to simulate energy consumption. Numerical simulations are performed on randomly generated instances with up to 50 targets to show that the proposed procedure determines tours for a given instance within a 1% standard deviation error from the best-known tour and on average improves the results obtained with the TSPN formulation up to 11.4%.",

        "abstract": "The design of a stable and robust force controller is one of the most important and difficult tasks in rehabilitation robotics. In previous works, the Universal Haptic Pantograph (UHP) was presented as an alternative to conventional arm rehabilitation after a stroke. This robot is composed by a Series Elastic Actuator (SEA) and a Pantograph. In this work an enhanced force control for the UHP is presented. The proposed controller uses the robot model to estimate the contact force without direct measurement and to compensate nonlinearities in the actuators. In order to prove the effectiveness of the approach, several tests are carried out in simulation and experimentally. Results reveal that mean of tracking errors between desired and actual force is smaller than 0.1 N, which is significantly improved compare to that (around 2.5 N) shown in previous results of UHP, indicating that the proposed force control is likely to enhance haptic performance of the UHP.",

Defining appropriate strategies and metrics is particularly hard when considering robot dynamics, which is required to treat constrained motion planning problems for quadrotors. This paper presents an accurate but computationally fast quasi-metric to determine the proximity of dynamic states of a quadrotor, and an incremental state-space sampling technique to avoid generating local trajectories that violate kinodynamic constraints. Results show that the integration of the proposed techniques in RRT-based and PRM-based algorithms can drastically decrease computing time, up to two orders of magnitude.",

Following a kinetostatic analysis, the forces generated by the finger will be obtained and analyzed. The performance of a practical implementation of the design will be subsequently evaluated and compared with another architecture inspired by a commercially available product.

Here we show that executing the resulting trajectories on a Darwin-OP robot, even with local feedback derived from the optimizer, does not result in stable movements. We then develop a new trajectory optimization method, adapting our earlier CIO algorithm to plan through ensembles of perturbed models. This makes the plan robust to model uncertainty, and leads to successful execution on the robot. We obtain a high rate of task completion without trajectory divergence (falling) in dynamic forward walking, sideways walking, and turning, and a similarly high success rate in getting up from the floor (the robot broke before we could quantify the latter). Even though the planning is still done offline, the present work represents a significant step towards automating the tedious scripting of complex movements.",

In this work, we propose two entropy based methods which aim to insert keyframes that will directly improve the system's ability to localize. The first approach inserts keyframes based on the cumulative point entropy reduction in the existing map, while the second approach uses the predicted point flow discrepancy to select keyframes which best initializes new features for the camera to track against in the future. We implement the proposed methods within the Multi-Camera Parallel Mapping and Tracking framework, and demonstrate the effectiveness of our methods using ground truth data collected using an indoor positioning system.",

To date, commonly used approaches produce uneven assignment of targets in situations where multiple targets have to be assigned to each robot. This imbalance can lead to increased overall exploration time and poses an interesting task for further investigation. Based on insights from Multi-Robot Routing and Traveling Salesman Problem research, we propose a specific algorithm for target point allocation that has advantageous properties in highly dynamic applications like exploration. The presented pairwise optimization procedure is suitable for application in distributed and challenging settings, not requiring central coordination or all to all communication, making our exploration strategy robust and flexible. We provide a theoretical analysis and statistical evaluations. Comparisons with representative approaches from the literature show that our algorithm is competitive with the best performing centralized approach.",

        "abstract": "A humanoid robot is underactuated and only relies on contacts with environment to move in the space. The ability to measure contact forces and torques enables then to predict the robot dynamics including balance. In classical cases, a humanoid robot is considered as a multi-body system with rigid limbs and joints and interactions with the environment are modeled as stiff contacts. Forces and torques at contacts are generally estimated with sensors which are expensive and sensitive to calibration errors. However, a robot is not perfectly rigid and contacts may have flexibilities. Therefore, external forces create geometric deformations of the body or its environment. These deformations may modify the robot dynamics and produce unwanted and unbalanced motions. Nonetheless, if we have a model of contact stiffness and are able to reconstruct reliably the geometric deformation, we can reconstruct forces and torques at contact. This study aims at estimating contact forces and torques and to observe the body kinematics of the robot with only an Inertial Measurements Unit (IMU). We show that we are able to reconstruct efficiently the position of the Center of Pressure (CoP) of the robot with only the IMU and proprioceptive data from the robot.",

        "abstract": "We present a behavioral approach for autonomous robotic exploration of marine habitat with collision avoidance given little or no prior information. In our previous work, a vision-based reactive navigation paradigm with a predefined forward direction allowed an underwater robot to avoid unexpected obstacles. In this work, we have now incorporated visual perceptive invariants to guide the navigation as a human diver would do, thus eliminating the need for a predefined trajectory or exact pose estimation, i.e., we are adding behavioral patterns to turn the navigation into an exploration. Our exploration architecture consists of a tracker of regions of interest and, a collision avoidance behavior. During the exploration, the robot's navigation system is guided towards the most relevant region while continuously checking for free space (water) to navigate. The proposed framework successfully combines both behaviors despite their opposite nature (moving towards a region to explore it while avoiding collisions). We have implemented our approach on an environment-friendly robot, which uses fins instead of propellers to allow for a non-invasive and cautious exploration. Results of sea trials performed at different locations and depths demonstrate the feasibility of our approach.",

        "abstract": "The purpose of this study is to establish a quantitative method that can evaluate the motor function of human lower limbs in dynamic situations. As an index of motor function, we focus on the mechanical impedance characteristics of the lower limbs. By controlling these characteristics, humans can improve motion stability and adapt their movement to disturbances in the environment. In this paper, we propose a method that can estimate the impedance characteristics of the lower limbs of a human subject applying torque perturbations during a pedaling exercise. To improve the accuracy of the proposed estimation method, the effects of inertia and gravity in the measurement data were considered by representing the lower limbs by a multi-link model. Experiments were performed in two participants to estimate the stiffness and viscosity at different phases of the periodic movement. The distributions of these parameters showed symmetric properties for both legs in a pedaling cycle-a tendency that was observed in both participants. This agreement suggests that our method could extract a component of human motor control strategy that adjust mechanical impedances during pedaling exercises.",

The proposed navigation policy exploits the nonholonomic nature of human locomotion in goal directed paths, which leads to a very simple guidance mechanism. The proposed method has been evaluated in a real scenario where seven human subjects were asked to walk along a set of predefined paths, and were guided via vibrotactile cues. Their poses as well as the related distances from the path have been recorded using an accurate optical tracking system. Results revealed that an average error of 0.24 m is achieved by using the proposed haptic policy, and that the predictive approach does not bring significant improvements to the path following problem for what concerns the distance error. On the contrary, the predictive approach achieved a definitely lower activation time of the haptic interfaces.",

        "abstract": "Animals and robots balance dynamically by placing their feet into proper ground targets. While foot placement controls exist for both fully robotic systems and powered prostheses, none enable the dynamism and reactiveness of able-bodied humans. A control approach was recently developed for an ideal double pendulum dynamical system that places feet into ground targets for a wide range of initial conditions and in the presence of significant locomotion disturbances. While its performance in simulation make it an attractive candidate to control legged robotic systems, it is unclear if the approach can be used on real-world systems. In this paper we transfer and evaluate the approach on robotic hardware. Our results show that the controller can be transferred to robotic systems and allow them to achieve comparable foot placement accuracies to an ideal double pendulum simulation, both when motion is undisturbed, as well as when obstacles are encountered in early, mid, and late swing. These results suggest that the proposed approach is a potential alternative control method for legged robots and powered prostheses, enabling recovery from sudden swing-leg disturbances such as trips and unexpected obstacle encounters. The results also point out the need for additional considerations when tuning the controller in order to generate human-like swing trajectories and durations.",

To compare the standard non-event based method with the proposed event-based method we present a comprehensive analysis of large-scale artificial skin systems for different test applications. For this purpose we collect data of 260 CellulARSkin cells on an UR-5 arm and calculate the events off-line. We determine the optimal packet size for event-based signaling and we show that the event-based system reduces the data rate with respect to the non-event based system for an unstimulated skin cell network to 16.45% and for a heavily stimulated skin cell network to 47.69%. The obtained results show that the event-based system reduces the data redundancy and the required transmission rates without loosing information.",

This measurement is adopted in several works but all of them are essentially calculated by enumerating over discretized directions of forces. Our proposed method does not need to discretize the direction, rendering the method more complete. The key idea of our method is that the measure is formulated as a function which depends on object vertices, disturbance force direction and hyperplanes of Unit grasp wrench space(UGWS). We proved that the reciprocal of this function is indeed concave over disturbance force direction, for a fixed object and fixed hyperplane of UGWS. Hence, we can derive analytical solution that find the global minimum of this function. A numerical example was carried out and the result shows that our proposed method can outperform the original computation in term of accuracy and efficiency.",

        "abstract": "Large-scale SLAM demands for scalable techniques in which the computational burden and the memory consumption is shared among many processing units. While recent literature offers competitive approaches for scalable mapping, these usually involve approximations to preserve sparsity of the resulting subproblems. We present an approach to scalable SLAM that is exactly sparse. The main insight is that rather than eliminating variables (which induces dense cliques), we split the separators connecting subgraphs. Then, we enforce consistency of the separators in different subgraphs using hard constraints. The resulting constrained optimization problem can be solved in a decentralized manner using the multi-block Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM). Our framework is appealing since (i) it preserves the sparsity structure of the original problem, (ii) it has a straightforward implementation, (iii) it allows to easily trade-off between computation time and accuracy. While our approach is currently slower than competitors, it is more accurate than other memory efficient alternatives. Moreover, we believe that the proposed framework can be of interest on its own as it draws connections with recent literature on decentralized optimization.",

        "abstract": "Kinematically complex robots such as legged robots provide a large degree of mobility and flexibility, but demand a sophisticated motion control, which has more tunable parameters than a general planning and decision layer should take into consideration. A lot of parameterizations exist which produce locomotion behaviors that fulfill the desired action but with varying performance, e.g., stability or efficiency. In addition, the performance of a locomotion behavior at any given time is highly depending on the current environmental context. Consequently, a complex mapping is required that closes the gap between robot-independent actions and robot-specific control parameters considering the environmental context and a given prioritization of performance indices.",

The supervisor overrides the controlled cars only when necessary to avoid a possible future collision. From the experiments, we demonstrate that intersection collisions are averted, that is, the cars continuously and safely run on the paths without stopping 92.8% of the times.",

        "abstract": "Bipedal walking with humanoid robots requires efficient real-time control. Nowadays, most bipedal robots require to ensure local stability at every instant in time, preventing them from achieving the impressive human walking skills. At the same time, bio-inspired walking controllers are emerging, though they are still mostly explored in simulation studies. However, porting these controllers to real hardware is needed to validate their use on real robots, as well as adapting them to face the world non-idealities. Here, we implemented one of them on a real humanoid robot, namely the COMAN, by conducting dynamic walking experiments. More precisely, we used a muscle-reflex model producing efficient and humanlike gaits. Starting from an off-line optimization performed in simulation, we present the controller implementation, focussing on the additional steps required to port it to real hardware. In our experimental results, we highlight some discrepancies between simulation and reality, together with possible controller extensions to fix them. Despite these differences, the real robot still managed to perform dynamic walking. On top of that, its gait exhibited stretched legs and foot roll at some points of the gait, two human walking features hard to achieve with most robot gaits. We present this on a 50 steps walk where the robot was free to move in the sagittal plane while lateral balance was provided by a human operator.",

Robots working in populated environments are thus expected to demonstrate socially acceptable behaviors and to follow social norms. However, most of the recent works in this field do not address the problem of explicit representation of the social norms and their integration in the reasoning and the execution components of a cognitive robot. In this paper, we address the design of robotic systems that support some social behavior by implementing social norms. We present a framework for planning and execution of social plans, in which social norms are described in a domain and language independent form. A full implementation of the proposed framework is described and tested in a realistic scenario with non-expert and non-recruited users.",

        "abstract": "The complete collection of resources from a predefined search area is a challenging task for autonomous robot swarms. Because naturally-occurring resources are likely to be distributed in clusters, foraging robot swarms can identify and exploit these resource clusters to improve collection efficiency. We describe an ant-inspired robot swarm foraging system that searches for and collects resources from a variety of distributions, and a cluster prediction and exploitation algorithm that augments swarm foraging by directing robots to residual resources. By characterizing the cumulative resource collection time for a robot swarm foraging in a variety of clustered resource distributions, we can identify the relationship between the \u201cclusteredness\u201d of the distribution and the change in the resource collection rate over time. Experiments show that collection efficiency is most significantly increased when robots switch from ant-inspired foraging to focused exploitation of clusters after approximately 90% of resources have been collected. Not surprisingly, clustering algorithms are most effective when resources are highly clustered in the environment. This work demonstrates the feasibility of efficient, complete resource collection using simple, range-limited robot swarms programmed with ant-inspired foraging behaviors.",

The lower-level optimises the six degrees-of-freedom (DoF) rigid-body transforms between the lidar and each camera of the multi-camera unit by minimising the Normalised Information Distance between intensity measurements obtained from both sensor modalities. The upper-level minimises a nonlinear least squares error between the lower-level solutions. We describe the theory, implement the method, and provide a detailed performance analysis with experiments on real-world data.",

The control framework consists of a motion pattern that exploits the redundancy of pelvis rotation to enlarge the kinematic workspace, a generic foot trajectory generation which can be modified by a parametric interface to adapt to a specific task as well as utilizing the hip abduction to avoid obstacle collision. Moreover, the compensation strategies are also presented for reducing the discrepancies to implement the dynamic stepping motion on a real robot. The effectiveness is validated by COMAN's capability of dynamically stepping over a large obstacle of 10cm height by 5cm width which is almost 20% of its leg length in both simulation and experiment.",

Such gestures can be necessary in noisy manufacturing environments where verbal communication is ineffective. Three studies are conducted. In Study 1 we explore hand configurations that human dyads use for nonverbal instruction (n = 17). In Study 2 we examine which hand-configurations from Study 1 are most accurately understood by observers (n = 140). In Study 3 we compare performance between a robot arm performing similar motions to those of human study participants using either an unposed or posed three-fingered robotic gripper (n =100) to observe the importance of the hand's pose. Recognition rates of directional gestures for both the human and the robot are examined. Results indicate that most gestures are better and more confidently recognized when displayed with the posed robot hand.",

We show how different classification systems for capabilities and components can be axiomatically linked together, how features can be propagated along compound components, and how complex features can be computed on the basis of combining role inclusion, role composition, and general concept inclusion axioms. In a second use case that is related to the logical deduction of potential hazards for a given workplace configuration, we show that the presented approach is applicable to similar modeling problems.",

        "abstract": "This paper represents an extension to the kinematic bicycle model for beveled-tip needle motion in soft tissue, which accounts for non-constant curvature paths for the needle tip. For a tissue that is not stiff relative to the needle, the tissue deformation caused by needle insertion deviates the needle tip position from a constant curvature path. The proposed model is obtained by replacing the bicycle wheels with omnidirectional wheels that move in two orthogonal directions independently. Such wheels can move sideways, providing a means for modeling the deviations of the needle tip from a constant curvature path by incorporating new parameters in the model. Using an experimental setup, the needle is inserted into soft phantom tissue at different constant velocities and model parameters are fitted to experimental data. The model is verified by comparing the results from the model to empirical data.",

        "abstract": "Teleoperated Unmanned Ground Vehicles (UGVs) are expected to play an important role in future search and rescue operations. In such tasks, two factors are crucial for a successful mission completion: operator situational awareness and robust network connectivity between operator and UGV. In this paper, we address both these factors by extending a new Free Look Control (FLC) operator interface with a graphical representation of the Radio Signal Strength (RSS) gradient at the UGV location. We also provide a new way of estimating this gradient using multiple receivers with directional antennas. The proposed approach allows the operator to stay focused on the video stream providing the crucial situational awareness, while controlling the UGV to complete the mission without moving into areas with dangerously low wireless connectivity. The approach is implemented on a KUKA youBot using commercial-off-the-shelf components. We provide experimental results showing how the proposed RSS gradient estimation method performs better than a difference approximation using omnidirectional antennas and verify that it is indeed useful for predicting the RSS development along a UGV trajectory. We also evaluate the proposed combined approach in terms of accuracy, precision, sensitivity and specificity.",

Balancing the upper body can be addressed by addition of a rigid trunk to this template model. The resulting model is not conservative and needs hip torque to keep the trunk upright during locomotion, like humans. Leg force modulated compliant hip (FMCH) is our new model for postural control in walking which employs the leg force feedback to adjust the hip compliance. Such an application of positive force feedback presents a new template for neuromuscular model. This method provides stable and robust walking in simulations and also mimics human-like kinetic behavior. Analyzing human walking experiment shows that FMCH can explain the hip torque-angle relation for different walking speeds. Finally, this approach may physically implement the virtual pendulum (VP) concept, observed in human/animal locomotion.",

Achieving such implicit coordination between humans and robots requires humans to be able to quickly and robustly predict the robot's intentions, i.e. the robot should demonstrate a behavior that is legible. Whereas previous work has sought to explicitly optimize the legibility of behavior, we investigate legibility as a property that arises automatically from general requirements on the efficiency and robustness of joint human-robot task completion. We do so by optimizing fast and successful completion of joint human-robot tasks through policy improvement with stochastic optimization. Two experiments with human subjects show that robots are able to adapt their behavior so that humans become better at predicting the robot's intentions early on, which leads to faster and more robust overall task completion.",

        "abstract": "T3D edge detection from a depth image is an important technique of 3D object recognition in preprocessing. There are three types of 3D edges in a depth image called jump, convex roof, and concave roof edges. Conventional 3D edge detection based on ring operators has been proposed. The conventional ring operator can detect three types of 3D edges by classifying the response of Fourier transforms. Since the conventional method needs to apply Fourier transforms to all pixels of a depth image, real-time processing cannot be done due to high computational cost. Therefore, this paper presents a fast and reliable method of detecting three types of 3D edges by using a decision tree. The decision tree is trained under supervised learning from numerous synthesized depth images and labels by capturing depth relations between candidate pixels and pixels on a ring operator to classify 3D edges. The experimental results revealed that the proposed method has 25 times faster than the conventional method. This paper also presents some examples of 3D line and 3D convex corner detection based on results obtained with the proposed method.",

        "abstract": "Accurate surface normal computation is one of the most basic and important tasks for 3d perception. While much progress has been made in speeding up normal estimation algorithms and improving their accuracy, a significant inaccuracy still remains even with modern implementations, which is the correct determination of surface normals close to non-differentiable surface edges. Current algorithms tend to amalgamate neighborhood points from independent surfaces yielding normals that neither fit well to the one nor the other surface. This paper introduces a fast and accurate 3d edge detection algorithm suitable to detect discontinuities both in depth and on surfaces with nearly 90% accuracy at rates beyond 30 Hz. Based on this method, we demonstrate how established normal estimation algorithms can be extended for edge-awareness. Additionally, a new edge-aware, fast, accurate, and robust normal estimation approach is described which exploits the data structures computed for 3d edge detection and estimates normals at 23 Hz. We assess the performance of all proposed methods and compare them with other state-of-the-art approaches.",

We present an approach for the automatic self-calibration of such scanners, using only a single scan of a targetless environment recorded over a complete 360\u00b0 rotation of the external motor that controls the motion of the 2-D sensor. By exploiting the intrinsic redundancies of the recorded point clouds and decimating the clouds using a voxel grid filter, we are able to compute and optimize a point cloud quality measure very quickly and without relying on explicit calibration targets. Our results on simulated and real data show the effectiveness of our approach by creating high-quality 3-D point clouds.",

        "abstract": "Maintaining clearance, or distance from obstacles and sampling efficient enough configurations on the medial axises are a vital component for successful motion planning. Maintaining high clearance often creates safer paths for robots. Having bias for sampling on medial axis also offers higher possibility to find a path in complex environment where the feasible configuration space only occupies a small proportion of the whole space. Inspired by the similarity between medial axis and max-margin scheme in optimization, especially in Support Vector Machine, we propose a new method to quickly construct the medial axis for the motion planning environment both in low and high dimensional space. However, directly applying the SVM classification on the large volume of uniformly sampled configurations suffers from huge computation and the medial axis is usually not the real medial axis due to SVM's optimization function's tolerance to the mis-classification. Instead, we show a method that can quickly push any configuration to the medial axis by using the characteristics of the Max-Margin's optimization function. Experiments in low and high dimensional space and comparisons with other medial-axis motion planning algorithm are shown.",

This strategy consists of a set of explicit laws, computed offline, each one dedicated to a fault situation. The corresponding law is selected according to the output of a fault detection and isolation (FDI) module. This module is designed with a non-linear sliding mode observer. The main advantage of this architecture is the deterministic character of the solution, its fast operation and the low computational load. The effectiveness of this approach is illustrated through real experimental application to a coaxial octorotor, where up to four motor failures are considered.",

The conventional lump detection methods are based on a pressure map obtained from contact pressure distributions, but they requires an adequate regulation of the contact condition during measurements. An alternative approach is to use a stiffness map, for which displacement measurement is necessary using additional devices or precise motion control. The proposed indicator relies on only the difference between the normal force and the surface normal obtained from contact pressure distributions. Thus, contact condition or probe motion does not affect the performance of the proposed method. The feasibility of the proposed method was evaluated by simulations and experiments, both of which showed promising results.",

        "track": "main",
        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "The absence of touch of sense is a widely known drawback of robotic minimally invasive surgery (MIS). This paper proposes a design of optic soft tactile arrays which is promising to be adapted for MIS. The proposed design consists of multiple soft material channels. Each channel is designed using the Bernoulli pipe structure to amplify the sensor's sensitivity through input and output diameter difference. A multi-core optic fiber cable and a camera are used to capture the change of light intensity caused by the contact forces applied onto the individual soft material channels. The proposed sensor has the following advantages: 1) making use of 3D printing and soft material casting, it is suitable for designing sensors with high density of tactile elements; 2) it also allows the sensor to be designed in an arbitrary shape to fit various MIS applications; 3) compared to other light-intensity based tactile sensor, it is easy to fabricate and miniaturize; it avoids the complexity of attaching reflectors to individual sensing elements; 4) it is immune to electromagnetic interference. In this paper, a prototype which has 3\u00d73 tactile elements in an area of 9.5 \u00d7 11 mm2 has been developed and test for feasibility study. Also, a noise-filtering algorithm is developed to reduce the imaging noise. Validation experiments were carried out and results show that the average measurable force range for a single tactile element is 0 to 1.622N with an average accuracy of 97%. The sensor has low crosstalk-to-signal ratio, 1.8% on average, and has no signal drift over time.",

        "abstract": "Adaptation is an essential capability for intelligent robots to work in new environments. In the learning framework of Programming by Demonstration (PbD) and Reinforcement Learning (RL), a robot usually learns skills from a latent feature space obtained by dimension reduction techniques. Because the latent space is optimized for a specific environment during the training phase, it typically contains fewer variations. Accordingly, searching for a solution within the latent space can be less effective for robot adaptation to new environments with unseen changes. In this paper, we propose a novel Feature Space Decomposition (FSD) approach to effectively address the robot adaptation problem, which is directly applicable to the learning framework based on PbD and RL. Our FSD method decomposes the high-dimensional original features extracted from the demonstration data into principal and non-principal feature space. Then, the non-principal features are used to form a new low-dimensional search space for autonomous robot adaptation based on RL, which is initialized using a generalized trajectory represented by a Gaussian Mixture Model that is learned from the principal features. The scalability of our FSD approach guarantees that optimal solutions can be found in the new non-principal space, if they exist in the original feature space. Experimental results on real robots validate that our FSD approach enables the robots to effectively adapt to new environments, and is usually able to find optimal solutions more quickly than traditional approaches when significant environment changes occur.",

This paper presents a solution to these challenges with a 2.3g autonomous legged robot. An off-the-shelf optical mouse sensor is adapted for use on the Harvard Ambulatory Microrobot (HAMR) by reducing the sensor weight by 36% and achieving a position error below 11% when suspended 3mm above a cardstock surface. The position data is combined with data from a gyroscope for feedback control of both position and orientation. A microcontroller processes the sensor data and commands a controlled gait to HAMR that is powered by a battery, a boost converter and high voltage drive electronics. Solar cells are used as an alternative source providing enough power for autonomous operation of the robot. The resulting deviation for a controlled straight-line walk using both sensors to minimize lateral deviation and angular error is only 4.6%, compared to an error of 31% in an uncontrolled, straight-line walk.",

The composition of the Lyapunov function that is obtained as a result of this planning process provides stabilizing feedback and the cost-to-go to the final destination in the neighborhood of the planned path, adding much flexibility and robustness to the plan.",

        "abstract": "Friction along the Bowden-cable transmission degenerates control performance unless it is properly compensated. Friction is produced when the bending angle of the Bowden-cable changes as the relative position of the actuator and the end-effector changes. This study proposes a method, termed loop routing, to compensate friction along the Bowden-cable. Loop routing involves making a one-round loop along the sheath that continuously maintains the sheath's bending angle at 2\u03c0 regardless of the end-effector's position in 2-D space. This minimizes the bending angle change of the sheath as the end-effector translates in a 3-D workspace, which minimizes the friction change and enables feedforward friction compensation of the Bowden-cable without employing a sensor. An experiment in open-loop tension control of the Bowden-cable was conducted to evaluate the performance of the proposed method. Results show that the output tension follows the reference tension well, with an RMS error of 4.3% and a peak error of 13.3% of maximum reference.",

        "abstract": "We present the design, fabrication, and characterization of a fiber optically sensorized robotic hand for multi purpose manipulation tasks. The robotic hand has three fingers that enable both pinch and power grips. The main bone structure was made of a rigid plastic material and covered by soft skin. Both bone and skin contain embedded fiber optics for force and tactile sensing, respectively. Eight fiber optic strain sensors were used for rigid bone force sensing, and six fiber optic strain sensors were used for soft skin tactile sensing. For characterization, different loads were applied in two orthogonal axes at the fingertip and the sensor signals were measured from the bone structure. The skin was also characterized by applying a light load on different places for contact localization. The actuation of the hand was achieved by a tendon-driven under-actuated system. Gripping motions are implemented using an active tendon located on the volar side of each finger and connected to a motor. Opening motions of the hand were enabled by passive elastic tendons located on the dorsal side of each finger.",

It moves around and hands over flyers about the mall and when people are interested or approach the robot to obtain some information, it starts the information-providing service. During the information-providing service, it provides directions and recommendations of shops in the mall. The robot is developed to be fully autonomous, but due to low performance in automatic speech recognition, this function is overtaken by a human operator. In our field trial, the robot worked for 53.4 hours (over 11 days) without any major failure (83.5% of time autonomously operated). We conducted interviews with visitors, and revealed that the majority of them found the information from the robot useful, and wanted to use it again.",

        "abstract": "Autonomous systems rely on an increasing number of input sensors of various modalities, and the problem of sensor fusion has received attention for many years. Autonomous system architectures are becoming more complex with time, and the number and placement of sensors will be modified regularly, sensors will fail for many reasons, information will arrive asynchronously, and the system will need to adjust to rapidly changing environments. To address these issues we propose a new paradigm for fusing information from multiple sources that draws from the rich of field pertaining to financial markets, particularly recent research on prediction market design. Among the many benefits of this financialized approach is that, both in theory and in practice, markets are well-equipped to robustly synthesize information from diverse sources in a decentralized fashion. Our framework poses sensor processing algorithms as profit-seeking market participants, data is incorporated via financial transactions, and the joint estimation is represented as a price equilibrium. We use pedestrian detection as a motivating application. Pedestrian detection is a well studied field and essential to autonomous driving. Real world fusion results are presented on RGB and LIDAR data from the KITTI Vision Benchmark Suite. We demonstrate we can achieve comparable performance to state-of-the-art hand designed fusion techniques using the proposed approach.",

        "abstract": "Teaching robots manipulative skills through human demonstration is an important research problem and can be used to quickly program robots in future manufacturing industries. To understand human demonstration, manipulative actions need to be recognized. To improve the recognition performance, we use three kinds of sensors to capture the motion and force involved in the fine manipulative actions. In addition, by taking advantage of the action/object correlation, the recognition accuracy can be further improved. In the proposed approach, important features for individual actions are selected first. Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) are employed to characterize the temporal changes. Then, a Bayesian model is adopted to model the object/action dependency. Our approach was evaluated through experiments on assembly tasks. The experimental results show that the proposed approach can recognize manipulative actions effectively.",

The actuator consists of a micromachined superelastic tool guide driven by a pair of pneumatic artificial muscles. Two additional working channels allow easy interchange of instruments or sensing equipment. This paper describes the design and construction of the actuation system. Experimental results are also reported indicating a bending repeatability of 0.1 degrees and an operational bandwidth exceeding 8Hz. To show-case the performance of the device, the actuator was loaded with an all-optical ultrasound imaging probe. First scanned images of human placental tissue surface using an all-optical ultrasound probe are presented. While a model has been developed to estimate the probe position in space as function of the input pressure, in future work, this model will be complemented with additional sensor measurements of the bending probe taking into account the hysteretic behaviour of both muscles and nitinol structure.",

        "abstract": "Robotic manipulation of deformable objects remains a challenging task. One such task is folding a garment autonomously. Given start and end folding positions, what is an optimal trajectory to move the robotic arm to fold a garment? Certain trajectories will cause the garment to move, creating wrinkles, and gaps, other trajectories will fail altogether. We present a novel solution to find an optimal trajectory that avoids such problematic scenarios. The trajectory is optimized by minimizing a quadratic objective function in an off-line simulator, which includes material properties of the garment and frictional force on the table. The function measures the dissimilarity between a user folded shape and the folded garment in simulation, which is then used as an error measurement to create an optimal trajectory. We demonstrate that our two-arm robot can follow the optimized trajectories, achieving accurate and efficient manipulations of deformable objects.",

We propose to encode the control signal with Radial Basis Functions (RBF), which enhances the robustness of the ILC scheme and allows to vary the execution speed of the learned motion. For that a novel control scheme is proposed, which updates the feedforward compensation signals based on current iteration cycle signals in contrast to the standard ILC, which uses signals from the previous iteration cycle. This reduces the computational burden and enhances the adaptation speed. Stability of the proposed control law is analysed and discussed. The proposed approach is evaluated in simulation and on a Kuka Light Weight Robot Arm where the task was to perform force-based surface following with both discrete and periodic movements.",

        "abstract": "It is well known that tactile information can be used to enhance the quality of grasping. Therefore, new technological solutions for sensing in grasping are needed. This paper presents an optical based fingertip sensor that measures both interaction forces and proximity between fingertip and environment. The combination of multiple sensing modalities in the tip of a finger can significantly improve grasping and manipulation capabilities. In this work we present the design and the required calibration of individual sensing elements, and of the integrated fingertip sensor developed for a 3-fingered metamorphic robotic hand. Emulated grasping experiments, using a pinch grip, were performed to illustrate the concept and validate the performance of the developed sensing system. As a result, it was possible to determine the sensor position with respect to an object during approach, contact and grasp.",

Position-based force-to-motion control schemes may not be suitable solution to provide the manipulator with the high compliance desirable during guidance along wide trajectories. A new torque controller with non-linear force feedback (FFE) is presented to provide augmented haptic perception to the operator, during the instrument's placement on the tissue. The FFE controller was experimentally validated with a pool of non-expert users using brain-mimicking gelatin phantoms (8%-16% concentration). Besides providing hand tremor rejection for a stable holding of the tool, the FFE controller was proved to allow for a safer tissue contact with respect to both robotic assistance without force feedback and freehand executions (50% and 75% reduction of the indentation depth, respectively). Future work will address the evaluation of the safety features of the FFE controller with expert surgeons on a realistic brain phantom, also accounting for unpredictable tissue motions as during seizures due to cortex stimulation.",

        "abstract": "Coil springs are nowadays widely used in robotic applications, in particular in Series Elastic Actuators. The measurement of spring force, either via load cells or via position sensors, conventionally requires additional sensor hardware to be part of or parallel to the kinematic chain. In order to simplify measurement of spring deflection, we exploit the fact that helical spring are in fact solenoid coils, and as such exhibit inductance properties that change strongly with length. We investigate theoretical models for this effect, and we experimentally evaluate the accuracy of such models in predicting spring length from inductance, with and without additional calibrating measurements. Our preliminary results show that a sensing precision as low as 2% can be achieved, indicating that the principle could be suitable for force sensing of compliant actuators.",

In this work, we present a low-cost, 18.7 gram force-torque sensor for a 10 cm hexapedal millirobot. A planar array of photointerrupters, rigidly attached to the structure of the robot, is used to measure the six-axis movement of a shell attached to the robot with springs. The sensors measure the intensity of infrared light reflected off of a surface on the underside of the shell, which has been specially designed to enable the resolution of the forces and moments in the x-, y-, and z-axes applied to the shell. The sensor has a force sensitivity of 17 mN and torque sensitivity of 0.72 mN-m for a sampling rate of 100 Hz. The sensor can resolve a force equivalent to 2.9% of the combined robot and sensor weight of 581 mN.",

        "abstract": "This paper aims at developing a unified and adaptive foot placement control for legged robots. The locomotion control of legged robots can be classified into three parts as body height control, body attitude control, and forward velocity control. In our study, the body attitude is controlled at stance phase by the hip actuator, and the height is controlled by the motion of the stance leg. In this case, the foot placement has a nearly linear correlation with forward velocity. Hereby, a generic foot placement controller is developed to control the forward velocity based on the online linear regression analysis of their coupled correlation. Our proposed algorithm is capable of adjusting the control parameters automatically, and is featured by good adaptability and higher control accuracy that outperforms the empirical tuning. The very same controller is able to produce stable hopping with accurate forward velocity tracking even with unknown mass offset, as well as stable bipedal running and walking with accurate velocity tracking.",

        "abstract": "This paper shows how to carry out batch continuous-time trajectory estimation for bodies translating and rotating in three-dimensional (3D) space, using a very efficient form of Gaussian-process (GP) regression. The method is fast, singularity-free, uses a physically motivated prior (the mean is constant body-centric velocity), and permits trajectory queries at arbitrary times through GP interpolation. Landmark estimation can be folded in to allow for simultaneous trajectory estimation and mapping (STEAM), a variant of SLAM.",

        "abstract": "This paper presents a robust 3D position tracking and map generation algorithm that combines data from a Laser Rangefinder and a RGB-D camera. Our algorithm is capable of running in real time on resource constrained robots. The novelty of this paper is the fusing of 2D-ICP from a Laser Rangefinder directly into a 3D position tracking, map building and SLAM system. Our approach takes advantage of the wide field of view and precision of laser scans to significantly improve the efficiency and accuracy of 3D alignment. We introduce a regularisation term to restrict movement in degrees of freedom that are not constrained by surface geometry. With efficiency in mind, we mirror a 2D local map based Graph SLAM approach in 3D to reliably detect loops if the robot comes near to an area it has previously visited. The mesh of each local map is warped after a graph of local maps is optimised to maintain a globally fused map. We provide experimental results to show that our algorithm is able to generate dense, globally consistent, mesh-based maps on resource constrained robots.",

As such, many ways of parameterising a rotation have been developed over the years. Motivated by the task of representing the orientation of a balancing body, the fused angles parameterisation is developed and introduced in this paper. This novel representation is carefully defined both mathematically and geometrically, and thoroughly investigated in terms of the properties it possesses, and how it relates to other existing representations. A second intermediate representation, tilt angles, is also introduced as a natural consequence thereof.",

This analysis is frequently performed in very specific conditions, because it often implies the use of treadmills, cameras and/or wearable sensors. Alternatively, gait can be analyzed using a smart rollator, equipped with a basic set of sensors. This work proposes a methodology to obtain relevant gait parameters using a simple, cheap source of information: wheel odometry and handlebar force sensors. The main advantages of this approach are that users are not bothered with extra equipment. Besides, monitoring can be performed anywhere, even during everyday conditions and for extended periods of time. We have tested our system with a set of rehabilitation patients with different disabilities. Preliminary results have successfully proven that extracted parameters are coherent with reported effects of their specific condition.",

These fluctuations can be used as landmarks, the use of which requires the creation of a magnetic map representing the distribution of the magnetic field. It is, however, difficult to build a large-scale magnetic map because of the narrow measurement range of a magnetic sensor. This paper proposes an efficient method for collecting magnetic data using a mobile robot and a method for building a magnetic map using Gaussian processes. The use of these methods make it possible to build a large-scale magnetic map efficiently. Moreover, this paper presents a particle filter-based localization method based on the magnetic map. The presented system enables a robot to identify its own position in large-scale buildings. Experiments are used to demonstrate the performance and usefulness of the presented system.",

In this paper, FEMI (Force-and-Energy Manipulability Index) is proposed to evaluate a feasible arm configuration for low energy consumption in its soil sampling operation. FEMI is calculated by the combination of an energy manipulability of an arm and an external force generated at an end effector of the arm. The FEMI derives the most feasible configuration on the joint angles of the arm for each sampling point. The usefulness of the FEMI is confirmed through a numerical simulation of a robotic arm. The simulation also presents that the FEMI can be used to obtain mechanical parameters of the arm such as link length and motor power, that are optimally-designed for a certain mission.",

At runtime, the architecture is able to estimate grasp quality metrics without the need to explicitly calculate the given metric. This ability is useful as the exact calculation of these quality functions is impossible from an incomplete view of a novel object without any tactile feedback. This architecture for grasp quality prediction provides a framework for generalizing grasp experience from known to novel objects.",

        "abstract": "This paper considers the problem of generating dynamically feasible and collision free trajectory for unmanned aerial vehicles(UAVs) in cluttered environments. General random-based searching algorithms output piecewise linear paths, which cause big discrepancy when used as navigation reference for UAVs with high speed. Meanwhile, the disturbance may also occur to lead the UAVs into danger. In order to obtain agile autonomy without potential dangers, this paper introduces a three-step method to generate feasible reference. In the first step, a six-order Bezier curve, which uses Tuning Rotation to decrease the curvature, is introduced to smooth the output of the path planner. Then a forward simulation is implemented to find the potential dangerous regions. Finally, the path is reshaped by local optimal reshaping planner to eliminate residual dangers. The three steps form a circulation, the reshaped path sent to the first step again to check dynamic feasibility and safety. The method combining Six-order Bezier curve, Tuning Rotation, and local optimal reshaping is proposed by us for the first time, where the Tuning Rotation is able to meet various curvature requirements without violating the previous path, local optimal reshaping obtains both temporal and spatial reshaping with high time efficiency. The method addresses the system dynamics to achieve agile autonomy, which provides the geometry reference as well as the low level control. The effectiveness of the proposed method is demonstrated by the simulations.",

        "abstract": "Recently micro manipulation techniques for cell or microorganism has attracted attention in life sciences. In this paper, non-contact manipulation method using water stream is proposed. Water stream is generated by a glass needle vibration that is actuated by a piezoelectric actuator. The stream is controlled by changing input voltage or frequency to the actuator. An accuracy of the motion of a piezoelectric actuator is in nano-meter order, so the stream is considered to be controlled precisely. The manipulator works in 3 dimensional space, that means water stream is generated in 3d space. We focused on the rotational stream generated by the glass needle 2-dimensional circular vibration. By using the resonance in a structure of the manipulator and the actuator's vibration, circular vibration can be generated by only one actuator. There is no need to use two actuators for generating circular vibration, so the structure of the manipulator is quite simple. In this paper rotational stream around the glass needle is also analyzed in 3d space using micro beads. This manipulator has the similar characteristics to the existing research of contact manipulation, so we think our method also have the capability to conduct contact manipulation.",

Our tracking solution is accurate, robust to sudden motions and to occlusions, as demonstrated on synthetic and real data. This solution is also easy to deploy since it only uses an RGB camera and a CAD model of the object of interest, requires no manual intervention on this model and runs on a consumer tablet at a frequency of 40Hz on a HD video-stream.

        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "Sensor fusion combines multiple sensor measurements to improve a controller's knowledge about the internal state of an observed physical environment. Many such sensor fusion techniques exist and have been implemented for the Robot Operating System (ROS). However, they often have been developed for specific applications and cannot be easily reused for other applications. Reasons are the use of application-specific, partly undocumented interfaces, and the often limited reconfigurability caused by a tight coupling of the implementation to an application-specific purpose. Our approach is based on the concept of a fusion node which provides a configurable sensor fusion service with a generic interface. Fusion nodes can be interconnected to combine several sensor fusion techniques, can be attached to any single-dimension value sensor, can handle asynchronous multi-rate measurements and are robust regarding indeterministic, best-effort communication. This paper presents, to the best of our knowledge, the first generic sensor fusion package (GSFP) for ROS which collects various exemplary sensor fusion methods implemented as fusion nodes. We demonstrate the feasibility of our package in a small test application. Main benefits of our contribution are the developed ROS package's independence regarding specific sensors or applications, the easy integration of configurable fusion nodes in existing applications, and the composition of fusion nodes to realize complex sensor fusion scenarios.",

        "abstract": "Global localization is a widely studied problem, and in essence corresponds to the online robot pose estimation based on a given map with landmarks, an odometry model, and real robot sensory observations and motion. In most approaches, the map provides the position of visible objects, which are then recognized to provide the robot pose estimation. Such object recognition with noisy sensory data is challenging. In this paper, we present an effective global localization technique using soft 3D object recognition to estimate the pose with respect to the landmarks in the given map. A depth sensor acquires a partial view for each observed object, from which our algorithm extracts the robot pose relative to the objects, based on a library of 3D Partial View Heat Kernel descriptors. Our approach departs from methods that require classification and registration against complete 3D models, which are prone to errors due to noisy sensory data and object misclassifications in the recognition stage. We experimentally validate our method in different robot paths with different common 3D environment objects. We also show the improvement of our method compared to when the partial view information is not used.",

        "abstract": "Bipedal walking is a complex and dynamic whole-body motion with balance constraints. Due to the inherently unstable inverted pendulum-like dynamics of walking, the design of robust walking controllers proved to be particularly challenging. While a controller could potentially be learned with a robot in the loop, the destructive nature of losing balance and the impracticality of a high number of repetitions render most existing learning methods unsuitable for an online learning setting with real hardware. We propose a model-driven learning method that enables a humanoid robot to quickly learn how to maintain its balance. We bootstrap the learning process with a central pattern generator for stepping motions that abstracts from the complexity of the walking motion and simplifies the problem setting to the learning of a small number of leg swing amplitude parameters. A simple physical model that represents the dominant dynamics of bipedal walking estimates an approximate gradient and suggests how to modify the swing amplitude to restore balance. In experiments with a real robot, we show that only a few failed steps are sufficient for our biped to learn strong push recovery skills in the sagittal direction.",

Employing a modified SHOT descriptor, we propose a fast KNN-based method for object categorization. Then the graspable components are identified by adopting a learning framework based on human experience. Finally, a fast grasp planning method comprised of contact points exaction and hand kinematics calculation accomplishes the grasp on the identified graspable component.

        "abstract": "In this paper, we present a method to plan grasps for soft hands. Considering that soft hands can easily conform to the shape an the object, with preference to certain types of basic geometries and dimensions, we decompose the object into one type of these geometries, particularly into Minimal Volume Bounding Boxes (MVBBs), which are proved to be efficiently graspable by the hand we use. A set of hand poses are then generated using geometric information extracted from such MVBBs. All hand postures are used in a dynamic simulator of the PISA/IIT Soft Hand and put on a test to evaluate if a proposed hand posture leads to a successful grasp. We show, through a set of numerical simulations, that the probability of success of the hand poses generated with the proposed algorithm is very good and represents an evident improvement with respect to our previous results published in [1].",

Biased estimates of the grasp pose cause undesired interaction wrenches on the human partner, which disturbs the interaction and the recognition of motion intention. A use of wearable motion sensors for tracking the human motion facilitates the grasp pose estimation without a global sensing system. This paper presents an approach for estimating an unknown grasp pose of the human using wearable motion sensors while minimizing undesired interaction wrenches applied to the human. A condition necessary for convergence of the estimator together with appropriate robot motion strategies are provided. Estimation of relative orientation and displacement is performed online and based on minimizing the error in the least-square sense. The estimation process does not rely on a global sensing system and it considers only the measurements of the velocity and acceleration of the cooperating partners in their respective local frames. The approach is experimentally evaluated in a physical human-robot interaction scenario.",

An evaluation value of grasp stability is derived as the minimum energy which causes slippage of a fingertip on its contact surface. To formulate the evaluation value, the elastic potential energy of fingertips and the gravitational potential energy of a grasped object are considered. It is ensured that fingertips do not slip on grasped object surfaces if the external energy applied to the object is less than the evaluation value. Since our evaluation value explicitly considers the deformation values of fingertips, grasp stability is evaluated by taking into consideration the contact forces generated by the deformation. The effectiveness of our method is verified through numerical examples.",

        "abstract": "Quick motion and soft touch control are important for autonomous grasping. To perform a grasping action, a hand must adjust its fingertips to match the object shape. It is also necessary to reduce the fingertip velocity on contact with the object.We propose a method of fingertip velocity control for fast approach and slow contact using proximity sensors installed on fingertips. The proposed control reduces the fingertip velocity at contact, decreasing the change of impulse force and thus making it appropriate for grasping soft or fragile objects. The proposed control uses time-to-contact (TTC), which is converted from sensor output. It is known that many animals, including humans, use TTC for collision avoidance. TTC represents the remaining time until collision considering the rate change of a control variable. We carried out grasping tests on various common objects using TTC. Experimental results show that the proposed control realizes fingertip alignment perpendicular to unknown shapes and surface objects and lowers the velocity at contact.",

Using a stereo camera rig, our system first calculates a disparity map and transforms it to a v-disparity map, which is then filtered and processed to generate a corresponding probability field. The probability field generated is then used for precise segmentation of ground planes as well as for the generation of occupancy grids. Unlike what is proposed in the prior art, our system requires minimal initialization and is independent of the stereo sensor characteristics as well as the parameters of the disparity algorithm. More importantly, our technique does not require any prior assumption about the terrain visual characteristics. Experimental results using sequences of images from two different data sets are presented to validate the proposed methods.",

The usage by non-experts sets additional requirements to the abilities of a robot system. For instance, the system should be able to understand natural language as one of the primary communication forms. This requires knowledge about actions, which shall be executed, or about objects, which shall be manipulated. In this work, we focus on grounding knowledge for actions within the domain of object manipulation. Our approach is based on the concept of verbalized physical effects and manipulation primitives. Therefore, we introduce the concept of verbalized physical effects, describe the relations between verbal instructions, verbalized physical effects and sensor based robot motions, and evaluate our approach using a robot manipulator.",

        "abstract": "Recently, there are an increasing number of developing wearable devices that intent to display various contents. As can be seen in sign languages and hand signals, hand gestures can express rich information with small motions, therefore, they are useful input for those devices. Especially, these gestures are less obtrusive actions than other actions such as speaking. It means that hand-gesture-based input interfaces are very suitable for public use, where a user can't use desktop devices such as a mouse or a keyboard. Although there are many studies on recognition of hand gestures, existing hand shape recognition methods have several problems to be applied for home automation. A wearable wrist contour sensor device has been proposed in previous studies. However discussions about how to design the protocols of hand gesture interface are insufficient. In this paper, we develop real time hand gesture interfaces of content browse for wearable or remote displays. Usability test using the developed interfaces reveals that pronation is to be assigned as a variable configurator and hand shape is to be assigned as an operation switcher.",

        "abstract": "We propose a novel method for performing fine-grained recognition of human hand grasp types using a single monocular image to allow computational systems to better understand human hand use. In particular, we focus on recognizing challenging grasp categories which differ only by subtle variations in finger configurations. While much of the prior work on understanding human hand grasps has been based on manual detection of grasps in video, this is the first work to automate the analysis process for fine-grained grasp classification. Instead of attempting to utilize a parametric model of the hand, we propose a hand parsing framework which leverages a data-driven learning to generate a pixel-wise segmentation of a hand into finger and palm regions. The proposed approach makes use of appearance-based cues such as finger texture and hand shape to accurately determine hand parts. We then build on the hand parsing result to compute high-level grasp features to learn a supervised fine-grained grasp classifier. To validate our approach, we introduce a grasp dataset recorded with a wearable camera, where the hand and its parts have been manually segmented with pixel-wise accuracy. Our results show that our proposed automatic hand parsing technique can improve grasp classification accuracy by over 30 percentage points over a state-of-the-art grasp recognition technique.",

A highly compliant hand allows for intrinsic robustness to grasping uncertainty, but the specific configuration of the hand and object is not known, leaving undetermined if a grasp was successful in picking up the right object. A soft finger was adapted and combined to form a three finger gripper that can easily be attached to existing robots, for example, to the wrist of the Baxter robot. Resistive bend sensors were added within each finger to provide a configuration estimate sufficient for distinguishing between a set of objects. With one data point from each finger, the object grasped by the gripper can be identified. A clustering algorithm to find the correspondence for each grasped object is presented for both enveloping grasps and pinch grasps. This hand is a first step towards robust proprioceptive soft grasping.",

With these extra information channels, how a user haptically interacts with a system potentially presents unique user dependent features and can thus be used for authentication purposes. In this paper, we propose a new biometric technology based on haptic interaction. Our technique leverages artificial neural network (ANN) based wavelet analysis to perform user identification. Identification and authentication are done in two steps: a discrete wavelet transform (DWT) is applied to extract features, and then the neural network is used to perform identification and authentication. The performance of the model is evaluated based on identification and authentication accuracies. The results show that our proposed haptic password system has a high identification accuracy and that it is resistant to forgery attacks.",

Such simulations are known to be difficult due to the non-linear behavior of hyperelastic bodies; furthermore, haptic constraints enjoin contact forces to be refreshed at least at 1000 updates per second. To enforce the stability of simulations of generic objects of any range of stiffness, this method relies on implicit time integration. Soft tissues dynamics is simulated in real time (20 to 100 Hz) using the Multiplicative Jacobian Energy Decomposition (MJED) method. An asynchronous preconditioner, updated at low rates (1 to 10 Hz), is used to obtain a close approximation of the mechanical coupling of interactions. Finally, the contact problem is linearized and, using a specific-loop, it is updated at typical haptic rates (around 1000 Hz) allowing this way new simulations of prompt stiff-contacts and providing a continuous haptic feedback as well.",

In this paper, a framework for path planning is introduced, that uses heuristic search to build up a search graph in belief space, an extension to the deterministic state space considering the uncertainty associated with this space. As sources of uncertainty actuator errors and map uncertainties are considered. We apply this framework to various scenarios for a non-holonomic vehicle and compare the resulting paths to heuristic state space planners and LQG-MP[1] with the help of simulations. As a result, paths generated with this framework could either not be found with worst-case assumptions or have a higher probability of being successfully executed compared to planners with more relaxed constraints.",

This walking pattern can be described by a cyclic motion, which can be modeled using the consecutive gait phases. In this paper, we present a completely non-invasive framework for analyzing and recognizing a pathological human walking gait pattern. Our framework utilizes a laser range finder sensor to detect and track the human legs, and an appropriately synthesized Hidden Markov Model (HMM) for state estimation, and recognition of the gait patterns. We demonstrate the applicability of this setup using real data, collected from an ensemble of different elderly persons with a number of pathologies. The results presented in this paper demonstrate that the proposed human data analysis scheme has the potential to provide the necessary methodological (modeling, inference, and learning) framework for a cognitive behavior-based robot control system. More specifically, the proposed framework has the potential to be used for the classification of specific walking pathologies, which is needed for the development of a context-aware robot mobility assistant.",

        "abstract": "We propose an eye robot system with master-slave control using operator-gaze tracking data, which can produce a high response level such as that of the human eyes. The operators can move a remote robot camera by only moving their eye (master) in front of an eye tracking apparatus and obtain visual information of the environment surrounding the robot's eye (slave). The use of ultrasonic motors has enabled the high responsiveness of the robot eye and the compactness of the robot body. Our graphical user interface (GUI) makes the operation intuitive. We evaluate the robot system from modeling the ultrasonic motor model to the usability of GUI. Finally, the proposed robot system's usability compares well with that of the joystick typically used to operate robots.",

        "abstract": "This paper develops a simple and low-cost method for 3D, high-rate vehicle state estimation, specially designed for free-flying Micro Aerial Vehicles (MAVs). We fuse observations from inertial measurement units and the recently appeared low-cost optical flow smart cameras. These smart cameras integrate a sonar altimeter, a triaxial gyrometer and an optical flow sensor, and directly provide metric ego-motion information in the form of body velocities and altitude. Compared to state-of-the-art visual-inertial odometry methods, we are able to drastically reduce the computational load in the main processor unit, and obtain an accurate estimation of the vehicle state at a high update rate of 100Hz. We thus extend the current use of these smart cameras from hovering purposes to odometry estimation. In order to propose a simple algorithmic solution, we investigate the performances of two Kalman filters, in the extended and error-state flavors, alongside a large number of algorithm variations, using simulations and real experiments with precise ground-truth. We observe that the marginal performance gain attained with these algorithm improvements does not pay for the effort of implementing them. We conclude that a classical EKF in its simplest form is sufficient for providing motion estimates that coherently exploit the available measurements.",

However, the image processing performed in conventional high-speed vision systems is mainly based on two-dimensional pattern recognition. In order to extend the possibilities of this technology, here we focus on real-time three-dimensional sensing at the speeds achievable by high-speed vision systems. Although a related approach for high-speed 3D sensing can achieve a frame rate of over 200 fps, there are disadvantages, including the need for multiple captured frames during sensing, a limited measurement range and low resolution. Our proposed real-time 3D sensing system consists of a projector and two cameras. By projecting a well-designed segmented pattern and using three-viewpoint epipolar constraints, the proposed system can obtain 3D points at high speed. The developed system robustly obtained a 3D shape at 450\u2013500 fps in real time.",

Various circular maneuvers are experimentally demonstrated, and tangential velocities of up to 15 m/s and centripetal accelerations of more than 13 g can be achieved in steady flight. The recorded data allows to characterize the flight behavior of quadrocopters at high airspeeds: As an example, an estimate of the actual thrust produced by the motors and of the aerodynamic drag acting on the vehicle is presented. An accompanying video shows tethered quadrocopters performing high-speed maneuvers.",

        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "This paper presents a dual-user teleoperation scheme to perform a collaborative task using n-DOF nonlinear manipulators as masters and slave. Impedance controllers for the manipulators are implemented in order to achieve a desired dynamic behavior depending on the user's necessities. Furthermore, a sliding mode controller is introduced to cope with the time delay in the communication channels and the uncertainty in the slave. Since the slave teleoperator is in contact with a rigid environment, the slave controller requires a free of chattering control strategy, which makes first order sliding mode teleoperation control unsuitable. Then a higher order sliding mode based impedance controller is proposed to guarantee robust impedance tracking under constant, but unknown time delay. Therefore, a position scaling factor is incorporated to deal with the different workspaces among masters and slave. The validity of the proposed control scheme is demonstrated via experimentation on a 3-DOF dual-user teleoperation system. While the haptic devices Phantom Premium 1.0A and a Phantom Omni are used as masters, a virtual industrial manipulator Catalyst-5 is used as slave. The dual-user system is tested not only in presence of constant unknown time delay in each of the communication channels but also in free and constrained motion regime.",

        "abstract": "Recent advances in soft sensors using microfluidic liquid conductors enabled sensing of large deformation of soft structures. However, the use of liquids as conductive media carries a risk of leakage in many cases. Furthermore, it could be harmful when exposed to the human body in certain applications. To address these issues, a different sensing mechanism was proposed: highly stretchable optical sensors that could detect multiple modes of deformation. The method of operation involves a simple waveguide and its housing which are both made of silicone elastomer. The soft waveguide is coated with a thin gold reflective layer to encapsulate light propagating internally, with an light-emitting diode (LED) and a photodiode embedded at each end. When the sensor is stretched, compressed, or bent, micro-cracks within the reflective layer form and allow part of the light to escape, resulting in optical power losses in the light transmission. In this paper, we describe the design and fabrication of the proposed soft sensors. A prototype was created and characterized for pressure, strain, and curvature up to 350 kPa, 90%, and 0.12 mm\u22121, respectively, showing promising results of reasonable repeatability and linearity in certain ranges.",

Intentions are modeled as goal locations in 3-dimensional (3D) space where the human is intending to reach. Human intention inference is a critical step towards realizing safe human-robot collaboration. This work models the human arm's nonlinear motion dynamics using an unknown nonlinear function with intentions modeled as parameters. The unknown model is learned using a neural network (NN). Based on the learned model, an approximate expectation-maximization (E-M) algorithm is developed to infer human intentions. Furthermore, an identifier-based online model learning algorithm is developed to adapt to variations in the arm motion dynamics, trajectory of motion, goal locations, and initial conditions of different human subjects. We show the results of our algorithm using two sets of experiments conducted on data obtained from different users.",

        "abstract": "Optical motion capture systems, which are used in broad fields of research, are costly; they need large installation space and calibrations. Applying this technology in typical homes and care centers is unrealistic. Low cost motion capture systems such as Microsoft Kinect are based on video, thus privacy issues might arise from their usage. Therefore we propose to use low cost contact force measurement systems to develop rehabilitation and healthcare monitoring tools that can be used widely. Here, we propose a novel algorithm for motion recognition using the feature vector from force data solely obtained during a daily exercise program. We recognized 7 types of movement (Radio Exercises) of 5 candidates (mean age 24, male). The results show that the average recognition rate for each motion has good score (mean: 75%), but leave room for improvement. The results also confirm that there is a dynamic signature in each movement allowing inter-personal recognition. Thus it is possible using inexpensive contact force measurement for motion analysis and motion recognition for applications such as rehabilitation or healthcare.",

        "abstract": "Human-autonomy sensor fusion is an emerging technology with a wide range of applications, including object detection/recognition, surveillance, collaborative control, and prosthetics. For object detection, humans and computer-vision-based systems employ different strategies to locate targets, likely providing complementary information. However, little effort has been made in combining the outputs of multiple autonomous detectors and multiple human-generated responses. This paper presents a method for integrating several sources of human- and autonomy-generated information for rapid object detection tasks. Human electroencephalography (EEG) and button-press responses from rapid serial visual presentation (RSVP) experiments are fused with outputs from trained object detection algorithms. Three fusion methods\u2014Bayesian, Dempster-Shafer, and Dynamic Dempster-Shafer\u2014are implemented for comparison. Results demonstrate that fusion of these human classifiers with computer-vision-based detectors improves object detection accuracy over purely computer-vision-based detection (5% relative increase in mean average precision) and the best individual computer vision algorithm (28% relative increase in mean average precision). Computer vision fused with button press response and/or the XDAWN + Bayesian Linear Discriminant Analysis neural classifier provides considerable improvement, while computer vision fused with other neural classifiers provides little or no improvement. Of the three fusion methods, Dynamic Dempster-Shafer Theory (DDST) Fusion exhibits the greatest performance in this application.",

        "abstract": "Previous studies on human-pose estimation rely on the design of factors to represent underlying probability distributions. However, designing factors is laborious and yet, the designed factors may not represent the underlying probability distributions. In this paper, we propose to use a neural network to automatically design factors in one of the existing models called the action-mixture model (AMM). Factors that are designed automatically by neural networks can be adapted to different situations. The semantic meaning of random variables in AMM can be transferred to a neural network, rendering the semantic meaning of hidden neurons transparent to users. The design process consists of two stages: structure identification and parameter learning. In the structure identification, we propose a bottom-up approach to build a neural network while preserving the structure of AMM. In the parameter learning, we propose a part-based approach to learn synaptic weights by decomposing a neural network into parts. Synaptic weights that have been learnt in one part can be used as initial weights for learning synaptic weights in another part. Based on the concept of distributed representation, the proposed two-stage, neural-network-based design process is used to design a scalable neural network to realize an AMM. Experimental results showed that the scalable neural network outperformed AMM and some existing works.",

        "abstract": "This paper presents a framework for information sharing and fusion in cooperative tasks involving humans and robots. In this context, all information regarding the state of interest is recursively fused and maintained by each agent in a form of belief. For a robot agent, its belief is commonly and practically represented as a probability density function (pdf), formed by traditional sensor fusion and state estimation algorithms. In cooperative tasks with non-expert humans, a robot needs to effectively communicate its belief so that the gathered information can be easily processed and interpreted by the humans. The goal of this research is to provide two-way information exchange and fusion between robots and humans, the former operating on pdfs, while the latter on English sentences. This is achieved by considering two goodness measures: semantic correctness and information preservation. Based on the goodness measures studied, results show that the proposed framework is able to generate optimal statements describing the given belief pdfs and successfully recover the initial inputs used to generate them. Additionally, in order to describe complex belief pdfs, a Mixture of Statements (MoS) model is proposed such that the optimal expression can be generated through a composition of more than one statements. With a nonparametric Dirichlet Process MoS generation, it is found that the robot can determine correctly the number of statements as well as the corresponding reference parameters needed to describe all hypotheses underlying its belief.",

        "abstract": "Although in recent years several studies aimed at the navigation of robots in cluttered environments, just a few have addressed the problem of robots navigating while moving a large or heavy object. This is especially useful when transporting loads with variable weights and shapes without having to change the robot hardware. On one hand, a major advantage of using a humanoid robot to move an object is that it has arms to firmly grasp it and control it. On the other hand, humanoid robots tend to have higher drift than their wheeled counterparts as well as having significant lateral swing while walking, which propagates to anything they carry. In this work, we present algorithms for a humanoid robot navigating in a cluttered environment while pushing a cart-like object. In addition, the algorithms make use of the hands and arms to articulate the cart when executing tight turns using whole body control scheme to reduce the lateral swing effect on the load and ensure a safe transport. Experiments conducted on a real Nao robot assessed the proposed approach and algorithms, they show that the payload of a humanoid robot can be significantly increased without changing the humanoid robot's hardware, and therefore enact the capacity of humanoid robots in real-life situations.",

        "abstract": "Traditional underwater vehicle-manipulator systems (UVMS) consist mainly of an underwater vehicle on which a manipulator is mounted. In addition to the vehicle thrusters, this paper proposes to use cables to actuate UVMSs. The main goal of this extra source of actuation is to enhance UVMS work capabilities. Similarly to cable-driven parallel robots, the cables are attached to the UVMS and a set of fixed winches permit the control of the cable lengths or tensions. We refer to this new system as a hybrid cable-thruster (HCT)-actuated UVMS. Based on the kinematic and dynamic model of HCTactuated UVMSs, this paper focuses on the determination of the available set of end-effector forces in a suitable mathematical representation. An illustrative simple planar example of HCTactuated UVMS is also presented.",

        "abstract": "Mapping evolving environments requires an update mechanism to efficiently deal with dynamic objects. In this context, we propose a new approach to update maps pertaining to large-scale dynamic environments with semantics. While previous works mainly rely on large amount of observations, the proposed framework is able to build a stable representation with only two observations of the environment. To do this, scene understanding is used to detect dynamic objects and to recover the labels of the occluded parts of the scene through an inference process which takes into account both spatial context and a class occlusion model. Our method was evaluated on a database acquired at two different times with an interval of three years in a large dynamic outdoor environment. The results point out the ability to retrieve the hidden classes with a precision score of 0.98. The performances in term of localisation are also improved.",

        "abstract": "We present a new hybrid approach to computing penetration depth (PD) for general polygonal models. Our approach exploits both local and global approaches to PD computation and can compute error-bounded PD approximations for both deep and shallow penetrations. We use a two-step formulation: the first step corresponds to a global approximation approach that samples the configuration space with bounded error using support vector machines; the second step corresponds to a local optimization that performs a projection operation refining the penetration depth. We have implemented this hybrid algorithm on a standard PC platform and tested its performance with various benchmarks. The experimental results show that our algorithm offers significant benefits over previously developed local-only and global-only methods used to compute the PD.",

        "abstract": "Fish caudal fin is a prominent example of biological propulsion, in which the caudal peduncle, fin rays and fin membrane together form a dynamic locomotory system. In this paper, we developed a bio-robotic model to mimic the caudal fin structure and kinematics of Bluegill Sunfish (Lepomis macrochirus). We coupled controlled oscillations in both heave and pitch directions to the robot to model the caudal peduncle motion of swimming fishes. Synchronized multi-axis force transducer and particle image velocimetry were then used to quantify the hydrodynamic forces and wake flow in the vertical plane. We found that changing the flow speed and the phase between the caudal fin ray and peduncle locomotion resulted in significantly different lift and thrust force. DPIV results showed that the vortex jet angle changed with flow speed and phase \u03c6. According to current experiment, we hypothesized that the fish caudal fin may function as a \u201cflexible vectoring propeller\u201d, and may be responsible for the three-dimensional maneuverability of fishes.",

        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "This work introduces the IRON keypoint detector and the IRON descriptor which enable high-speed and high-accuracy alignment of 3D depth maps. Instead of using raw point values for storing 3D-scenes, all algorithms were designed to operate on Normal Distribution Transforms (NDT), since NDT-maps provide a highly memory-efficient representation of depth data. By taking into account surface curvature and object shape within NDT-maps, patches with strong surface variability can be recognized and described precisely. In this paper, the whole feature extraction process, as well as descriptor matching, outlier detection, and the final transform calculation between NDT-maps is elaborated. The presented technique is particularly insensitive to an initial offset between both maps, has a high robustness, and it achieves more than 75 NDT-map alignments per second (including complete memory allocation each time as well) in two large publicly available depth datasets while using only a single core of a modern Intel i7 CPU. Even though the main focus of this work was placed on the proposed IRON registration algorithm, two specific applications of this NDT-matching approach are outlined in the second part, namely robot pose tracking and NDT-one-shot localization within densely furnished domestic environments.",

        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "In this study, we experimentally investigated the process leading to fracture in tofu grasping by deformable fingertips filled with a fluid. In our previous papers [1, 2], we developed deformable fingertips using a rubber bag filled with a viscoelastic fluid, and presented a strategy for delicate tofu grasping without any advance knowledge about fracture. However, the predication point was close to fracture, and the prediction was then still a gamble. In order to realize fracture prediction at an earlier stage, we examined the process leading to fracture when pushing tofu by the deformable fingertips. The stiffness of the fingertips can be controlled with the pressure of the fluid inside the fingertips. The pushing force and fluid pressure were examined for different levels of stiffness of the fingertips. The main findings and contributions are as follows. 1) The convergence of the ratio of the contact force to fluid pressure gives an indication of dent occurrence. This convergence could be seen when fingertip rubber bag was not filled (low stiffness). 2) It was easier for a dent to occur when the fingertip rubber bag was not filled than when it was filled (high stiffness). 3) Changes in the rate of increase of the fluid pressure as the tofu was pushed were repeatedly observed. We defined this as a phase change and present a method for detecting such changes. The phase change points were detected by comparing the fitting accuracies of different approximation models. 4) The last and second to the last phase changes before fracture were detected by detecting the first phase change (after the convergence of the rate of the contact force to fluid pressure if the fingertip bag was not completely filled). The detected points can be regarded as alert points indicating a fracture risk that is not close to the fracture point.",

The mass parameters provided by CAD data are usually rough approximation of the true parameters. Therefore several methods for estimation of those parameters have been proposed. Their precision depends on the used motion, called optimal exciting trajectories. This paper describes a new approach to determine humanoid robot exciting trajectories for mass parameters identification. The method was inspired by the studies done in the field of human mass parameters identification, and it is based on observation of condition numbers of sub-regressor matrices created from the columns of the regressor matrix. The method has been experimentally applied to identify mass parameters of HRP-2 and HRP-4 humanoid robots. The proposed method is able to reconstruct ground reaction forces and force moments more accurately than parameters obtained from CAD data.",

On the object motion, we deliberately impose non-holonomic velocity constraint with pushing mobile robots. This yields smooth and efficient trajectories. Pushing manipulation is performed, for the first time, with a new uncalibrated image-based control scheme. This is achieved by transforming the image information to a scaled Euclidean space without using any metric information or calibration. Stability of the control law is also demonstrated.",

We also develop an 1/10-scale excavation model and conduct excavation experiment. In the experiment, the proposed method works well from the view point of productivity. It is confirmed that the fragmented rock pile condition can be described by its shape and the particle size distribution of its surface. The proposed approach has feasibility in autonomous excavation of the fragmented rock pile. Experimental results also reveal that both the number of learning data and the diversity of learning data are important to realize a high-productive excavation.",

        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "This paper introduces the control method for the impact force based on feed-forward control considering the stiffness ellipse of a biped robot. Assuming dynamic motion, such as jumping and running, the jumping direction depends on the dynamics in response to the ground reaction force. Therefore, it is necessary to control the ground reaction force in order to stabilize the system. However, control of the ground reaction force involves a fundamental problem: feedback control does not work properly against the impact force owing to the control bandwidth limitation. This study introduces a method for the stiffness ellipse control utilizing three antagonist pairs of six pneumatic artificial muscles. When the tip of the biped robot makes contact with the ground, an external force is induced in the direction that has lower stiffness. By utilizing this property of the stiffness ellipse, it is possible to control the ground reaction force by feed-forward control, which is not dependent on the control bandwidth. The results of several experiments convince us that the relationship between the ground reaction force and the stiffness ellipse is almost linear, and the ground reaction force can be controlled with high reproducibility by adjusting the stiffness ellipse. It is possible to stabilize the system during dynamic movements because this method can control the impact force.",

        "abstract": "Tubular continuum robots are particularly useful for minimally invasive surgery due to their small size and ability to dexterously manipulate in constrained environments. The robot can be used teleoperated or operated (semi-)autonomously. In both cases, safe manipulation has to be ensured considering constraints from the patient's unique anatomy and pathology to prevent injury of nerves, vessels, and soft tissue. While probabilistic path planning methods have been proposed for tubular continuum robots which generate sequences of collision free configurations in obstructed environments, these methods do usually not explicitly consider different trajectory generations. In this paper, we evaluate four trajectory generation strategies in terms of the resulting Cartesian paths and spatial extent of the course of motion. We demonstrate the implication of the different strategies on both collision free path planning and an example medical scenario. In conclusion, consideration of trajectory generation strategies is indispensable, if the distance between intermediate configurations increases - even though those intermediate configurations might be collision free.",

In this work, we demonstrate how multiagent cooperative coevolutionary algorithms can develop successful control policies for dynamic and stochastic multi-robot exploration missions. We find that agents using difference evaluation functions (a technique that quantifies each individual agent's contribution to the team) provides superior system performance (up to 15%) compared to global evaluation functions and a hand-coded algorithm.",

        "abstract": "Probabilistic Roadmap Methods (PRMs) solve the motion planing problem by constructing a roadmap (or graph) that models the motion space when feasible local motions exist. PRMs and variants contain several phases during roadmap generation i.e., sampling, connection, and query. Some work has been done to apply machine learning to the connection phase to decide which variant to employ, but it uses a global learning approach that is inefficient in heterogeneous situations. We present an algorithm that instead uses local learning: it only considers the performance history in the vicinity of the current connection attempt and uses this information to select good candidates for connection. It thus removes any need to explicitly partition the environment which is burdensome and typically difficult to do. Our results show that our method learns and adapts in heterogeneous environments, including a KUKA youBot with a fixed and mobile base. It finds solution paths faster for single and multi-query scenarios and builds roadmaps with better coverage and connectivity given a fixed amount of time in a wide variety of input problems. In all cases, our method outperforms the previous adaptive connection method and is comparable or better than the best individual method.",

In this context, the hammering test is an efficient inspection method, and it has been widely used because of the resulting accuracy and efficiency of operation. While robotic automation of the hammering inspection method is highly desirable, the development of an automatic diagnostic algorithm that can operate at actual inspection sites is essential. Furthermore, portability of the diagnostic algorithm is also highly desirable. In this study, in order to construct reliable detectors and to improve their portability for the performance of the hammering test, we propose a boosting-based defect detector that is robust against variations in environmental conditions. In particular, we present the construction of a noise-robust classifier with a refinement of the feature values extracted from hammering sounds and an updating rule of template vectors of its evaluation function. Our experimental results in a concrete tunnel demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method; the accuracy of the classifier at an actual site and adaptivity to environmental noise are confirmed.",

This article investigates how such information can augment the precision of a point cloud classifier. It presents an empirical evaluation of a low cost LiDAR, introduces features related to the intensity and multiple echoes and their use in a hierarchical classification scheme. Results on varied outdoor scenes are depicted, and show that more precise class identification can be achieved using the intensity and multiple echoes than when using only geometric features.",

        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "Existing commercial driver assistance systems, including automatic braking systems and lane-keeping systems, may monitor the state of the vehicle or the environment to determine whether the systems should intervene. However, the state of the human driver is not typically included in the decision making process. In this paper, we propose to use hidden mode stochastic hybrid systems to model the interaction between the human driver and the vehicle. We show that by monitoring the human behavior as well as the vehicle state, we can infer the human state and enhance the quality of decision making in a driver assistance system. The resulting control policy is obtained by solving an optimal planning problem of the proposed hidden mode hybrid system. The policy can automatically balance the decision making about when to give warning to the driver and when to actually intervene in the control of the vehicle.",

        "abstract": "Cable driven power transmission is popular in many manipulator applications including medical arms. In spite of advantages obtained by removing motors from the mechanism, cable transmission introduces higher non-linearity and more uncertainties such as cable stretch and cable coupling. In order to improve the control precision and robustness of the Raven-II surgical robot, particularly for automation applications, the Unscented Kalman Filter (UKF) was adopted for state estimation. The UKF estimated state variables of the Raven-II dynamic model from sensor data. The dual UKF was used offline to estimate cable coupling parameters. The experimental results showed that the proposed method improved joint position estimation precision and the estimation consistency, especially on the more elastic links. The improvements for links 2 and 3 of the Raven were 36.76%, and 62.99%, respectively. For link 1 the improvement was 1.43% because the transmission is very stiff.",

Most previous studies about knotting by robots assume that the rope is placed on a table. However, in-air knotting requires more skillful hand manipulations, such as swapping ropes between the right and left hands. Therefore, we herein focus on hand motion and first extract the essential hand motions for knotting, referred to herein as skill motions, by observing human knotting procedures. Next, hardware with the capability of executing these skill motions is developed. Finally, experiments are conducted to confirm that several types of knots can be tied in the air using the proposed method.",

In our approach, the robot holds the tool with a pinch grasp and we model the system as a link attached to the gripper via a passive revolute joint with friction, i.e., the grasp only affords rotational motions of the tool around a given axis of rotation. The robot controls the slippage by varying the opening between the fingers in order to allow the tool to move to the desired angular position following a reference trajectory. We show experimentally how the proposed controller achieves convergence to the desired tool orientation under variations of the tool's inertial parameters.",

The mobile robot has two U-shaped electromagnets and four piezoelectric actuators (PAs) for obtaining 3-degrees-of-freedom (3DoF) motion on well-polished ferromagnetic surfaces. We have proposed the kinematic model to get relationship among four input voltages to PAs and three displacements of the robot at a half step. We have also solved the inverse trajectory analysis of the probe to convert the motion errors of the probe into those of the robot. Moreover, we have proposed repetitive calibration formulas to calibrate 3DoF motion of the probe under a microscope simultaneously. In experiments, we have checked that the proposed formulas are surely working for decreasing the motion errors at straight motion although rotation around the tip is hard to calibrate because of its posture measuring error of an image processor. We discuss compact and flexible microscopic operations.",

        "abstract": "This paper proposes a method to increase the impedance range of admittance-type haptic interfaces. Admittance-type haptic interfaces are used in various applications that typically require interaction with high impedance virtual environments. However, the performance of admittance haptic interfaces is often judged by the lower boundary of the impedance that can be achieved without stability problem; in particular, minimum displayable inertia. It is well known that rendering the low value of inertia makes the admittance-type haptic interfaces unstable easily. This paper extends Time Domain Passivity Approach (TDPA) to lower down the minimum achievable inertia in an Admittance-type haptic interface. To use the well-developed TDPA framework, an admittance haptic interface should be represented in network domain with clear energy flows, which was not straightforward due to unclear causality. Therefore by introducing dependent effort and flow source concept, the admittance type haptic interface is represented in electrical network domain. This network representation allows us to have clear causality, and consequently allowing to implement TDPA. The proposed idea was experimentally verified, and found successful in bringing down the minimum inertia 10 times lower than without TDPA case.",

        "abstract": "Aquiring reliable depth maps is an essential prerequisite for accurate and incremental 3D reconstruction used in a variety of robotics applications. Depth maps produced by affordable Kinect-like cameras have become a de-facto standard for indoor reconstruction and the driving force behind the success of many algorithms. However, Kinect-like cameras are less effective outdoors where one should rely on other sensors. Often, we use a combination of a stereo camera and lidar, however, process the acquired data in independent pipelines which generally leads to sub-optimal performance since both sensors suffer from different drawbacks. In this paper, we propose a probabilistic model that efficiently exploits complementarity between different depth-sensing modalities for incremental dense scene reconstruction. Our model uses a piecewise planarity prior assumption which is common in both the indoor and outdoor scenes. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on the KITTI dataset, and provide qualitative and quantitative results showing high-quality dense reconstruction of a number of scenes.",

        "abstract": "In this paper, we propose a novel online multiobject learning and detection algorithm. From single seed images of the target objects, our algorithm detects these objects in the input sequence, and incrementally updates the databases with the detection results. Reasonably sized databases are maintained as graphs of the registered images, while new views of the objects are added as the detection proceeds. The importance of the registered images is computed using our ranking algorithm, and redundant images are pruned from the database. The proposed method fully utilizes graphical representation to detect and recognize objects. A 3D model of a candidate object is built on-the-fly using the retrieved images, and initially undetected features are hallucinated for further matching and verification. This process improves the detection performance compared to the baseline algorithm. Object/background feature classification and object-likelihood maps effectively keep noisy background features from being added to the databases. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm efficiently maintains the object databases and achieves better performance.",

        "abstract": "Urban reconstruction from a video captured by a surveying vehicle constitutes a core module of automated mapping. When computational power represents a limited resource and, a detailed map is not the primary goal, the reconstruction can be performed incrementally, from a monocular video, carving a 3D Delaunay triangulation of sparse points; this allows online incremental mapping for tasks such as traversability analysis or obstacle avoidance. To exploit the sharp edges of urban landscape, we propose to use a Delaunay triangulation of Edge-Points, which are the 3D points corresponding to image edges. These points constrain the edges of the 3D Delaunay triangulation to real-world edges. Besides the use of the Edge-Points, a second contribution of this paper is the Inverse Cone Heuristic that preemptively avoids the creation of artifacts in the reconstructed manifold surface. We force the reconstruction of a manifold surface since it makes it possible to apply computer graphics or photometric refinement algorithms to the output mesh. We evaluated our approach on four real sequences of the public available KITTI dataset by comparing the incremental reconstruction against Velodyne measurements.",

Given a segmented trajectory, a simplified map of the environment, and a set of error thresholds, we implement a map-matching algorithm in a urban setting and analyze the accuracy of the resulting path. We also discuss aggregation of user step data into a segmented trajectory. Besides providing an interesting application of learning human motion in a constrained environment, we examine how the uncertainty of the snapped trajectory varies with path length. We demonstrate that as new segments are added to a path, the number of possibilities for earlier segments is monotonically non-increasing. Applications of this work in an urban setting are discussed, as well as future plans to develop a formal theory of odometry-based map-matching.",

In order to inform operators the potential data in the views, we introduced several augmented reality (AR) elements to induce visual attention to suitable images in a scenario. The purpose of this study is to develop an attention inducement system using AR technique and evaluate it under different conditions. We first improve our autonomous camera control system and then implement several kinds of AR items suitable for each work situation. The experimental results conducted using our virtual reality simulator confirm that AR items can supply a better positional relationship between machine and objects in the environment which makes operator handle the conditions as experienced. The results from eye-tracker data also indicate that AR items can induce visual attention to images suitable for situations.",

We use a special type of the Noisy-OR model known as BN2O model of Bayesian inference network to represent the inter-visibility and to infer the locations of the doors, i.e., potential locations of the opponents. Experimental results on both synthetic data and real person tracking data achieve an F-measure of over .9 on average, suggesting further investigation on the use of non-visual perception in human-robot team operations.",

        "abstract": "We propose an algorithm that enables robots to improve their spatial-semantic representation of an environment by engaging users in dialog during a guided tour. The algorithm selects the best information gathering actions in the form of targeted questions that reduce the ambiguity over the grounding of user-provided natural language descriptions (e.g., \u201cThe kitchen is down the hallway\u201d). These questions include those that query the robot's local surround (e.g., \u201cAre we in front of the kitchen?\u201d) as well as areas distant from the robot (e.g., \u201cIs the lounge near the conference room?\u201d). Our algorithm treats dialog as an optimization problem that seeks to balance the information-theoretic value of candidate questions with a measure of cost associated with dialog. In this manner, the algorithm determines the best questions to ask based upon the expected entropy reduction, while accounting for the burden on the user. We evaluate entropy reduction for a joint distribution over a hybrid metric, topological, and semantic representation of the environment learned from user-provided descriptions and the robot's sensor data during the guided tour. We demonstrate that, by asking deliberate questions of the user, the method significantly improves the accuracy of the learned map.",

We first formulate optimal lossy compression for OGs based on the Principle of Relevant Information. The solution to this formulation is a simple compression algorithm that is motivated by rate distortion theory. We then compress OGs to different resolutions and develop a second optimization based on the Information Bottleneck method that chooses a resolution simultaneously maximizing compression and minimizing loss of information from the robot's sensor measurements. On computationally constrained systems, the resulting reduction in computational complexity enables planning over longer predictive horizons, leading to higher-speed operation. Using these techniques to adaptively optimize OG resolution as the robot enters a new area causes it to autonomously slow down in obstacle-dense locations and speed up in open expanses. We simulate and experimentally evaluate mutual information-based exploration through cluttered indoor environments with exploration rates that adapt based on environment complexity, leading to an order-of-magnitude increase in the maximum rate of exploration in contrast to non-adaptive techniques given the same finite computational resources.",

        "abstract": "This paper presents a method for integrating a cooperative manipulation task in the design of dynamic walking motions for an underactuated bipedal robot. Applications that involve physical interaction between a walking biped and a leading human (or robot) collaborator, require that the biped exhibits compliance at the port of interaction with the collaborator, while at the same time be capable of adjusting its stepping pattern in response to the interaction forces developed. To achieve these objectives, the proposed method combines impedance control of the biped's arm with position control of its legs in a way that the closed-loop system adapts its stepping pattern in accordance with the collaborator's intentions. The method is applied in the case of a bipedal robot model walking over flat ground and up and down stairs of known geometry under the influence of a trajectory that is unknown to the biped and represents the intention of a collaborator.",

        "abstract": "Real-world robotic systems have to perform reliably in uncertain and dynamic environments. State-of-the-art cognitive robotic systems use an abstract symbolic representation of the real world for high-level reasoning. Some aspects of the world, such as object dynamics, are inherently difficult to capture in an abstract symbolic form, yet they influence whether the executed action will succeed or fail. This paper presents an integrated system that uses a physics-based simulation to predict robot action results and durations, combined with a Hierarchical Task Network (HTN) planner and semantic execution monitoring. We describe a fully integrated system in which a Semantic Execution Monitor (SEM) uses information from the planning domain to perform functional imagination. Based on information obtained from functional imagination, the robot control system decides whether it is necessary to adapt the plan currently being executed. As a proof of concept, we demonstrate a PR2 able to carry tall objects on a tray without the objects toppling. Our approach achieves this by simulating robot and object dynamics. A validation shows that robot action results in simulation can be transferred to the real world. The system improves on state-of-the-art AI plan-based systems by feeding simulated prediction results back into the execution system.",

        "abstract": "In robot-assisted upper limb rehabilitation, detecting the intentions of hemiplegic patients is essential towards assisting the patients to actively exercise instead of driving passive motions. Many interactive channels, such as voice, EMG and EEG, have been studied to estimate the motion intentions. However, limitations of these techniques, such as high complexity, have constrained their applications in practice. In this paper, we integrate a virtual environment and a low-cost motion sensor into a novel control strategy to detect motion intentions for a rehabilitation robot. Several bimanual motion sequences are intuitively programmed by a professional therapist for subjects to repeat. The strategy uses the unaffected arm and the programmed motion sequence to estimate the motion intentions of the affected arm. We adopt this strategy in Mirror Therapy, a widely-practised therapeutic intervention method. Experiments have been conducted to validate the control strategy.",

        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "Sensitivity Amplification Control (SAC) algorithm was first proposed in the augmentation applications of Berkeley Lower Extremity Exoskeleton (BLEEX). The SAC algorithm is widely used in human augmentation applications since it just need the information from the exoskeleton robot, so that the complexity of exoskeleton system can be reduced greatly. However, the SAC algorithm has two main drawbacks: 1) requiring accurate dynamic models of the exoskeleton, 2) can not manage the variation of interaction dynamics from different walking speed. This paper presents a novel developed learning control strategy based on SAC algorithm. In the proposed Adaptive Sensitivity Amplification Control (ASAC) strategy, the reinforcement learning method is utilized to learn the sensitivity factors online for the sake of handling the variation of interaction dynamics. We demonstrate the control efficiency of ASAC on an one degree-of-freedom (DOF) platform with swing movements first, and then extend it into a HUman-powered Augmentation Lower EXoskeleton (HUALEX). The experimental results show that the proposed ASAC strategy can handle the changing interaction dynamics with less interaction force between the pilot and the exoskeleton as compared with traditional SAC algorithm.",

        "abstract": "This paper investigates localization of sound sources in a real environment using a tablet device. For the localization, we use build-in sensors on a tablet device and additionally mount a cover with a microphone array. Because of the flat shape and limited sensor performance, the localization has mainly the following three issues; 1) the flat microphone array allows only azimuth estimation but elevation estimation; 2) the measurement noise of built-in sensors degrades the direction of arrival estimation performance; 3) the direction of arrival is not sufficient information to localize sound sources in three dimensional space to explore. To solve these issues, we propose interactive sound source localization using robot audition. For 1), we propose elevation estimation by integrating sound azimuth estimation and device motion information under an active audition framework in robot audition. For 2), we introduced a constrained optimization to robustify the direction of arrival estimation. For 3), we propose an interactive interface based on augmented reality for tablet devices, which navigates the device camera view to sound sources to explore. The proposed system was evaluated both subjectively and objectively and showed validity in real cases of sound source localization.",

        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "We present MantisBot, a 28 degree of freedom robot controlled by a high-fidelity neural simulation. It is modeled after the mantis, with many degrees of freedom, because we intend to study directed behaviors and leg multi-functionality, such as prey tracking and striking. As a first step, we present a distributed reflexive posture controller. MantisBot maintains posture through a series of reflexes observed in insects, specifically: strain measurements from a leg produce proportional torque commands (reflex A); large or rapidly decreasing leg strains produce a rapid, single \u201crestep\u201d (reflex B); a leg can only restep if its neighboring legs are all under strain (reflex C); and a leg will search for the ground if it does not reach it as expected (reflex D). All of these reflexes contribute to a hardware platform's posture, and are implemented in a highly distributed fashion. The two most distal joints in each leg each has its own central pattern generator (CPG, 12 total), upon which all of these behaviors depend. To achieve the desired dynamics, we implement a control network of conductance-based neurons with persistent sodium channels arranged in a network like the animal may possess in its thoracic ganglia. The result is a robot capable of actively maintaining posture without a centralized planner or body model. In addition, the network implementation is fast, calculating network dynamics 150 times faster than real time.",

        "abstract": "Assistive devices such as exoskeletons are capable of providing rehabilitative improvement and independence for individuals suffering from musculoskeletal conditions. Typical devices use either active assistance methods such as DC motors or passive methods such as springs. Active methods require a continuous power input, while passive methods are limited by user capability. This work introduces an Active/Passive EXoskeleton (APEX) framework. This device can passively provide continuous assistance, only requiring energy to change the dynamic properties of the passive state. The first prototype (APEX-\u03b1) is introduced and tested on six healthy subjects who performed hammer curls. It was found that changes in the passive state of the APEX-\u03b1 affect the number of curls performed by an individual. By changing the passive state of the exoskeleton, increases in curl count of 65 - 92% were observed. This indicates the potential for such devices to provide assistance to an individual through the use of lightweight, energy efficient active/passive actuators.",

        "abstract": "Advances in miniature surgical instrumentation are key to less invasive and safer medical interventions. In cardiovascular procedures interventionalists turn towards catheter-based interventions, treating patients considered unfit for classical more invasive approaches. Improvements in design and steerability of catheters could further reduce the invasiveness of these interventions. For example, by improving controllability and interaction forces with the vessels, tissue damage could be limited. Through improved steerability and coordinated control, operation times and exposure to radiation might also be reduced. Latter argument formed the original motivation for the development of teleoperated robotic catheters. Despite the large kinematic dissimilarity and thus non-trivial mapping between joystick input and catheter output motion, few investigations have been conducted to find intuitive mappings that allow straightforward catheter steering. This paper presents some recent work in this direction. Three promising mappings are proposed. The mappings were implemented and validated upon a robotic catheter moving inside an artificial aorta model. Experimental results show good steerability of the robotic catheter for all the mappings. Although superiority of one mapping with respect to the others was observed, further investigation and validation is planned. In the future, additional visual cues that increase the situational awareness of the user are expected to further simplify the steering.",

        "abstract": "Search and rescue (SAR) missions are being carried out by several types of robots. They include ground, marine and air vehicles depending on the terrain and mission to be tackled. A particular niche for SAR activities are shallow waters. They present high difficultly for conventional ground or marine robots because of the mix of water and ground. Such an environment is difficult to be accessed for a robot without some built-in amphibious capabilities. Our lab has experience in the design of amphibious salamander-like robots. In order to consider whether these robots would be suited for SAR missions in shallow waters, a key requirement is the ability to tackle rough terrains. In this paper we present a control framework for a highly redundant salamander-like robot. It involves bio-inspired spine control, inverse kinematics-based limb control, proper limb-spine coordination, reflex mechanisms and attitude control. The framework is validated in a simulation and on the real robot. In both cases, the robot is used in two different configurations: with and without its tail, in order to investigate how the tail (which is necessary for swimming) affects ground locomotion. With this exploration, we aim to set the precedent for improving the problem of dynamic locomotion of salamander-like robots over unperceived rough terrain. Our results confirm that the design of reflexes like stumbling and extension, combined with an attitude controller, allows for the improving of the performance of the robot in a generic rough terrain which includes stairs, holes and bumps with several levels of complexity adjusted according to the robot dimensions.",

        "abstract": "In general, the problems of objects' and rooms' categorizations for robotic applications have been addressed separately. The current trend is, however, towards a joint modelling of both issues in order to leverage their mutual contextual relations: object \u2192 room (e.g. the detection of a microwave indicates that the room is likely to be a kitchen), and room \u2192 object (e.g. if the robot is in a bathroom, it is probable to find a toilet). Probabilistic Graphical Models (PGMs) are typically employed to conveniently cope with such relations, relying on inference processes to hypothesize about objects' and rooms' categories. In this work we present a Conditional Random Field (CRF) model, a particular type of PGM, to jointly categorize objects and rooms from RGBD images exploiting object-object and object-room relations. The learning phase of the proposed CRF uses Human Knowledge (HK) to eliminate the necessity of gathering real training data. Concretely, HK is acquired through elicitation and codified into an ontology, which is exploited to effortless generate an arbitrary number of representative synthetic samples for training. The performance of the proposed CRF model has been assessed using the NYU2 dataset, achieving a success of ~ 70% categorizing both, objects and rooms.",

        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "Robust, scalable localization unlocks path-planning, obstacle avoidance as well as manipulation and thus is a core competency for many robotic applications. However, as we leave the lab and move out in the world, models of the environment no longer span distances of meters but kilometers in length. Now, gigabytes instead of megabytes of memory are required to hold the model of the environment required for localization. Discarding data and keeping the map representation compact is thus essential for any meaningful application. This paper presents and evaluates a map compression algorithm that approaches this data-reduction as an constrained optimization problem. At the core of the algorithm is the concept of a Summary Map, a reduced map representation that includes only the landmarks that are deemed most useful for place recognition. To assign landmarks to the map we have to satisfy the conflicting goals of map coverage and localizability as well as our tight memory budget. While using an optimization approach for compression is not novel, in this paper we propose adaptations to drastically reduce the computational requirements. Our approach improves scalability from trajectories of a few tens of meters manageable by the state of the art to virtually unlimited dataset sizes in our system. We evaluate the performance of various compression levels as well as several methods for selecting the best localization landmarks from outdoor datasets.",

The similarities are then used to predict the future locations of a target. For a given environment with a history of previous target trajectories, the goal is to establish a probabilistic framework to predict the future trajectory of currently observed targets based on their recent moves. Instead of clustering trajectories into groups, we calculate the similarity between a given test trajectory and the set of all past trajectories in a dataset. Next, we use a weighted mechanism for prediction, that can be used in target tracking and collision avoidance applications. The proposed method is compared with two other commonly used similarity models (PCA and LCSS) over a dataset of simulated trajectories, and two datasets of real observations. Results show that the proposed method significantly outperforms the existing models for those datasets and experimental settings.",

        "abstract": "An algorithm is proposed for matching data from different sensing modalities. The problem is formalised as a kidnapped robot problem, where Bayesian fusion is used to find the most likely location where both modalities agree. The key idea of our algorithm is to model the correlation between the two modalities as a likelihood used to update a location prior. Data, in this case, is represented as 2.5D thickness maps from a laser scanner and a Remote Field Eddy Current (RFEC) tool, used in non-destructive testing to assess the condition of infrastructures. The laser data is limited, while RFEC data is continuous. Given some prior in location, the aim is to find the 2.5D thickness map from the laser that corresponds to the RFEC data, which should be noted is highly noisy. Real data from CCTV inspections of water pipes are used to validate the proposed approach.",

        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "The use of more than one steerable (standard) driving wheel allows a robot to perform omnidirectional motions. However, the modeling and control of such robots is challenging since the system is non-holonomic, nonlinear and typically over actuated. Moreover, such platforms exhibit kinematic singularities. A well known singular configuration is the configuration where two steerable driving wheels are coaxial aligned. This is highly problematic since this configuration corresponds to pure rotations, which is crucial for narrow space navigation. In this paper a control scheme with improved robustness w.r.t. these singularities is derived. It is based on the second order (accelerations) non-holonomic constraints. The remaining singularity is tackled by a regular parametrization of the robot's motion. Thereupon a novel control concept is presented which is based on an input-output linearization in terms of a path parameter. The choice of this parametrization provides an additional parameter in the controller design. The approach is demonstrated for a prototype implementation.",

        "abstract": "This paper challenges the well-established assumption in robotics that in order to control a robot it is necessary to know its kinematic information, that is, the arrangement of links and joints, the link dimensions and the joint positions. We propose a kinematic-free robot control concept that does not require any prior kinematic knowledge. The concept is based on our hypothesis that it is possible to control a robot without explicitly measuring its joint angles, by measuring instead the effects of the actuation on its end-effector. We implement a proof-of-concept encoderless robot controller and apply it for the position control of a physical 2-DOF planar robot arm. The prototype controller is able to successfully control the robot to reach a reference position, as well as to track a continuous reference trajectory. Notably, we demonstrate how this novel controller can cope with something that traditional control approaches fail to do: adapt to drastic kinematic changes such as 100% elongation of a link, 35-degree angular offset of a joint, and even a complete overhaul of the kinematics involving the addition of new joints and links.",

Based on the biological architecture of human masticatory system, this robot is modeled in the form of a redundantly actuated parallel mechanism constrained by two point-contact higher kinematic pairs (HKPs). The aim of this robot is to chew samples of newly developed foods in a human way while the food textures can be characterized. The kinematics including inverse kinematics, workspace and singularity are studied systematically. The inverse kinematics is given in closed-form solutions. The workspace is generated by a numerical search method. In virtue of the Jacobian matrix derived from differential kinematics, the singularity and the stiffness are investigated. Via the derived stiffness matrix and mass matrix, natural frequency is also computed. Finally, simulation is carried out, one real incisor trajectory of a healthy human subject is reproduced, illustrating the robot is able to reproduce kinematic behaviors of the human masticatory system, and it owns a satisfactory performance in terms of stiffness and natural frequency. Comparison between the redundantly actuated masticatory robot and its two non-redundantly actuated counterparts also exhibits that the former owns better performance, in terms of a similar incisor's workspace as the Posselt envelope, no singularity, larger stiffness and higher natural frequency.",

This paper extends this approach for kinodynamic planning in dynamic environments by performing the exploration in both space and time domains. Thus, a time-dependent heuristic is constructed to guide the search algorithm applying a kinodynamic vehicle model. Furthermore, the search step-size and state resolution are adapted incrementally to guarantee resolution completeness with a trade-off for efficiency. The performance of Space-Time Exploration Guided Heuristic Search (STEHS) approach is verified in two scenarios and compared with several search-based and sampling-based methods.",

The robots are given structures through self-folding and functions using printed actuators. We developed a new system and device to fabricate more sophisticated printed robots. First, we successfully fabricated complex self-folding structures by applying an automatic cutting. Second, a rapidly created and low-voltage electrothermal actuator was developed using an inkjet printed circuit. Finally, a printed robot was fabricated by combining two techniques and two types of paper; a structure design paper and a circuit design paper. Gripper and conveyor robots were fabricated, and their functions were verified. These works demonstrate the possibility of paper mechatronics for rapid and low-cost prototyping as well as of printed robots.",

        "abstract": "Analysis of human running has revealed that the motion of the human leg can be modeled by a compression spring because the leg's joints behave like a torsion spring in the stance phase. Moreover, the knee bends rapidly to avoid contact of the foot with the ground in the swing phase. In this paper, we describe the development of a knee joint mechanism that mimics the elastic characteristics of the stance leg and rapid bending knee of the idling leg of a running human. The knee was equipped with a mechanism comprising two leaf springs and a worm gear for adjusting the joint stiffness and high-speed bending knee. Using this mechanism, we were able to achieve joint stiffness within the range of human knee joints that could be adjusted by varying the effective length of one of the leaf springs. In addition, the mechanism was able to bend rapidly by changing the angle between the two leaf springs. The equation proposed for calculating the joint stiffness considers the difference between the position of the fixed point of the leaf spring and the position of the rotational center of the joint. We evaluated the performance of the adjustable joint stiffness and the effectiveness of the proposed equation for joint stiffness and high-speed knee bending. We were able to make a bipedal robot hop using pelvic oscillation for storing energy produced by the resonance to leg elasticity and confirmed the mechanism could produce large torque 210 Nm.",

A suitable representation of the knot topology is introduced taking into account the use of supporting elements and the characteristics of flying machines. This information is then translated into three-dimensional trajectories for the vehicle performing the aerial knot-tying task. Furthermore, preliminary results suggest that the quality of the resulting knot can be improved by the use of an iterative learning algorithm.

        "abstract": "State-of-the-art techniques for simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) employ iterative nonlinear optimization methods to compute an estimate for robot poses. While these techniques often work well in practice, they do not provide guarantees on the quality of the estimate. This paper shows that Lagrangian duality is a powerful tool to assess the quality of a given candidate solution. Our contribution is threefold. First, we discuss a revised formulation of the SLAM inference problem. We show that this formulation is probabilistically grounded and has the advantage of leading to an optimization problem with quadratic objective. The second contribution is the derivation of the corresponding Lagrangian dual problem. The SLAM dual problem is a (convex) semidefinite program, which can be solved reliably and globally by off-the-shelf solvers. The third contribution is to discuss the relation between the original SLAM problem and its dual. We show that from the dual problem, one can evaluate the quality (i.e., the suboptimality gap) of a candidate SLAM solution, and ultimately provide a certificate of optimality. Moreover, when the duality gap is zero, one can compute a guaranteed optimal SLAM solution from the dual problem, circumventing non-convex optimization. We present extensive (real and simulated) experiments supporting our claims and discuss practical relevance and open problems.",

        "abstract": "This paper presents a systematic flight controller design based on the mathematics of parametrized manifolds and calculus of variations for the Bat Bot (B2), which possesses many articulated wings. Wing kinematics and morphological properties are crucial in the powered flight of flying vertebrates. The articulated skeleton of these mammals, which contains many degrees of actuation and underactuation, has made it difficult to understand the connection between the bat's flight dynamics and its intricate array of physiological and morphological specializations. B2 is a biomimetic micro aerial vehicle (MAV) that possesses similar morphological properties to a bat in order to duplicate bats powered ballistic motion. In an effort to design the advanced flight control algorithm for B2, this paper reports two major contributions. First, a systematic mathematical framework is introduced that evaluates the holonomically-constrained Lagrangian model of a flapping robot with specified active and passive degrees of freedom (DoF) in order to locate physically feasible and biologically meaningful periodic solutions using optimization. These are parametrized constraint manifolds; the flapping wing dynamics are governed by these manifolds. Second, calculus of variations and the well-recognized method of inverse dynamics are applied in order to synthesize the flight control algorithm for the flapping wings.",

Road segments, intersections and salient structures such as houses and trees are detected using vision and LiDAR data. The landmarks are entered in a sparse metrictopological map that is used for navigation. In contrast to traditional SLAM approaches, however, we only store the information required to navigate along the path of the robot that built the map. Due to the sparseness of the data, it can easily be transmitted to other robots via a low-bandwidth radio connection (9600 bit/s), allowing the receivers to reconstruct the map, localize themselves in it and follow the path recorded by the sender. All of this is done without the help of global navigation satellite systems such as GPS. The algorithms were tested and evaluated in practical experiments with our autonomous cars MuCAR-3 and MuCAR-4.",

        "abstract": "We propose a real-time, direct monocular SLAM method for omnidirectional or wide field-of-view fisheye cameras. Both tracking (direct image alignment) and mapping (pixel-wise distance filtering) are directly formulated for the unified omnidirectional model, which can model central imaging devices with a field of view above 180 \u00b0. This is in contrast to existing direct mono-SLAM approaches like DTAM or LSD-SLAM, which operate on rectified images, in practice limiting the field of view to around 130 \u00b0 diagonally. Not only does this allows to observe - and reconstruct - a larger portion of the surrounding environment, but it also makes the system more robust to degenerate (rotation-only) movement. The two main contribution are (1) the formulation of direct image alignment for the unified omnidirectional model, and (2) a fast yet accurate approach to incremental stereo directly on distorted images. We evaluated our framework on real-world sequences taken with a 185 \u00b0 fisheye lens, and compare it to a rectified and a piecewise rectified approach.",

        "abstract": "We propose a novel Large-Scale Direct SLAM algorithm for stereo cameras (Stereo LSD-SLAM) that runs in real-time at high frame rate on standard CPUs. In contrast to sparse interest-point based methods, our approach aligns images directly based on the photoconsistency of all high-contrast pixels, including corners, edges and high texture areas. It concurrently estimates the depth at these pixels from two types of stereo cues: Static stereo through the fixed-baseline stereo camera setup as well as temporal multi-view stereo exploiting the camera motion. By incorporating both disparity sources, our algorithm can even estimate depth of pixels that are under-constrained when only using fixed-baseline stereo. Using a fixed baseline, on the other hand, avoids scale-drift that typically occurs in pure monocular SLAM.We furthermore propose a robust approach to enforce illumination invariance, capable of handling aggressive brightness changes between frames - greatly improving the performance in realistic settings. In experiments, we demonstrate state-of-the-art results on stereo SLAM benchmarks such as Kitti or challenging datasets from the EuRoC Challenge 3 for micro aerial vehicles.",

We consider a walking logistics support robot, which is designed to carry heavy loads to locations that are too difficult to reach with a wheeled or tracked vehicle. In this application the robot is carrying equipment and supplies for a group of pedestrians, and the primary task for the user interface is to keep the robot traveling with the overall group in the right formation. This paper presents a marker tracking system that uses near infrared cameras, retro-reflective markers, and LIDAR to allow a particular user to designate himself as the robot's leader, and guide the robot along a desired path. We provide an extensive quantitative evaluation to show that the proposed system is able to detect and track a leader through unconstrained and cluttered off-road environments under a wide variety of illumination and motion conditions.",

A problem that arises from learning PSRs is that it is often hard to attribute semantic meaning to the learned representation. This makes generalization and planning in PSRs challenging. In this paper, we extend PSRs and introduce the notion of PSRs that include prior information (P-PSRs) to learn representations which are suitable for planning and interpretation. By learning a low-dimensional embedding of test features we map belief points of similar semantic to the same region of a subspace. This facilitates better generalization for planning and semantical interpretation of the learned representation. In specific, we show how to overcome the training sample bias and introduce feature selection such that the resulting representation emphasizes observables related to the planning task. We show that our P-PSRs result in qualitatively meaningful representations and present quantitative results that indicate improved suitability for planning.",

        "abstract": "Predicting the outcome of an action can help a robot detect failures in advance, and schedule action replanning before an error occurs. We propose using an interactive physics based simulator with the aim of collecting realistic data to be used for learning. We then show how we save and query for specific information from the data more effectively. The data from the simulation is used to learn a failure detection model which is utilized by a real robot performing the same actions. We show that learning from simulation data is realistic enough to be applied on a real robot. The learning algorithm is more simple in design and outperforms the more complex one from our previous work.",

        "abstract": "Very often, when addressing the problem of human-robot skill transfer in task space, only the Cartesian position of the end-effector is encoded by the learning algorithms, instead of the full pose. However, orientation is just as important as position, if not more, when it comes to successfully performing a manipulation task. In this paper, we present a framework that allows robots to learn the full poses of their end-effectors in a task-parameterized manner. Our approach permits the encoding of complex skills, such as those found in bimanual manipulation scenarios, where the generalized coordination patterns between end-effectors (i.e. position and orientation patterns) need to be considered. The proposed framework combines a dynamical systems formulation of the demonstrated trajectories, both in \u211d3 and SO(3), and task-parameterized probabilistic models that build local task representations in both spaces, based on which it is possible to extract the relevant features of the demonstrated skill. We validate our approach with an experiment in which two 7-DoF WAM robots learn to perform a bimanual sweeping task.",

        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "Applications of reinforcement learning for robotic manipulation often assume an episodic setting. However, controllers trained with reinforcement learning are often situated in the context of a more complex compound task, where multiple controllers might be invoked in sequence to accomplish a higher-level goal. Furthermore, training such controllers typically requires resetting the environment between episodes, which is typically handled manually. We describe an approach for training chains of controllers with reinforcement learning. This requires taking into account the state distributions induced by preceding controllers in the chain, as well as automatically training reset controllers that can reset the task between episodes. The initial state of each controller is determined by the controller that precedes it, resulting in a non-stationary learning problem. We demonstrate that a recently developed method that optimizes linear-Gaussian controllers under learned local linear models can tackle this sort of non-stationary problem, and that training controllers concurrently with a corresponding reset controller only minimally increases training time. We also demonstrate this method on a complex tool use task that consists of seven stages and requires using a toy wrench to screw in a bolt. This compound task requires grasping and handling complex contact dynamics. After training, the controllers can execute the entire task quickly and efficiently. Finally, we show that this method can be combined with guided policy search to automatically train nonlinear neural network controllers for a grasping task with considerable variation in target position.",

        "abstract": "Learning from demonstration by means of non-rigid point cloud registration is an effective tool for learning to manipulate a wide range of deformable objects. However, most methods that use non-rigid registration to transfer demonstrated trajectories assume that the test and demonstration scene are structurally very similar, with any variation explained by a non-linear transformation. In real-world tasks with clutter and distractor objects, this assumption is unrealistic. In this work, we show that a trajectory-aware non-rigid registration method that uses multiple demonstrations to focus the registration process on points that are relevant to the task can effectively handle significantly greater visual variation than prior methods that are not trajectory-aware. We demonstrate that this approach achieves superior generalization on several challenging tasks, including towel folding and grasping objects in a box containing irrelevant distractors.",

        "abstract": "The number of mechanical degrees of freedom (DoFs) within rehabilitation robots directly influences the scope of the movements that a subject can perform when training walking. Currently, gait rehabilitation robots have a limited number of mechanical DoFs, as a consequence this limits the movements these robots can make possible. In this paper, the novel gait rehabilitation system CORBYS is presented which consists of the mobile platform and a powered orthosis which is attached to the platform. The CORBYS powered orthosis has 16 DoFs enabling more physiological movements, making it a state-of-the-art gait rehabilitation robotic system. With the sufficient number of DoFs to enable natural-like walking, the CORBYS robotic system enables the integration of the \u201clearning gait by therapist demonstration\u201d paradigm. This paper presents the fully integrated functional CORBYS gait rehabilitation system, with the focus on the implementation aspects which enable generation of the reference gait trajectory through learning by therapist demonstration, and the use of the generated trajectory in the robotic therapy session. The results of the initial evaluation of the robotic system obtained in tests with a selected patient are given in the paper.",

In this paper, we therefore present a novel approach to human motions analysis using motor control strategies with joint weight parameterization. We record the motions of healthy subjects and PD patients performing a hand coordination task with the whole-body XSens MVN motion capture system. For our motion strategy analysis we then follow a two step approach. First, we perform a complexity reduction by mapping the recorded human motions to a simplified kinematic model of the upper body. Second, we reproduce the recorded motions using a Jacobian weighted damped least squares controller with adaptive joint weights. We developed a method to iteratively learn the joint weights of the controller with the mapped human joint trajectories as reference input. Finally, we use the learned joint weights for a quantitative comparison between the motion control strategies of healthy subjects and PD patients. Other than expected from clinical experience, we found that the joint weights are almost evenly distributed along the arm in the PD group. In contrast to that, the proximal joint weights of the healthy subjects are notably larger than the distal ones.",

        "abstract": "Learning motor skills from multiple demonstrations presents a number of challenges. One of those challenges is the occurrence of occlusions and lack of sensor coverage, which may corrupt part of the recorded data. Another issue is the variability in speed of execution of the demonstrations, which may require a way of finding the correspondence between the time steps of the different demonstrations. In this paper, an approach to learn motor skills is proposed that accounts both for spatial and temporal variability of movements. This approach, based on an Expectation-Maximization algorithm to learn Probabilistic Movement Primitives, also allows for learning motor skills from partially observed demonstrations, which may result from occlusion or lack of sensor coverage. An application of the algorithm proposed in this work lies in the field of Human-Robot Interaction when the robot has to react to human movements executed at different speeds. Experiments in which a robotic arm receives a cup handed over by a human illustrate this application. The capabilities of the algorithm in learning and predicting movements are also evaluated in experiments using a data set of letters and a data set of golf putting movements.",

        "abstract": "Learning models of behaviours has many applications in robotics spanning both control, e.g. learning from demonstration and perception, e.g. monitoring and surveillance. Inverse reinforcement learning encodes behaviours as a reward function learned from a set of demonstrations. This paper addresses the problem of learning from unlabelled datasets containing an unknown number of behaviours in continuous action-state spaces. The proposed method uses a hierarchical clustering approach to directly group trajectories that share a common reward function. The similarity metric is based on the distribution of maximum entropy of the feature counts computed using path integrals. We evaluated the method in three different tasks: navigation on a set of synthetic maps, human driving styles on a simulator and human reaching. Results show that clustering in the reward space is able to discover the latent reward structure resulting in compact models that can generate all the observed behaviours.",

For some tasks, physical contact between the user and the robot may occur, originating significant challenges at safety, cognition, perception and control levels, among others. This paper focuses on robot motion adaptation to parameters of a collaborative task, extraction of the desired robot behavior, and variable impedance control for human-safe interaction. We propose to teach a robot cooperative behaviors from demonstrations, which are probabilistically encoded by a task-parametrized formulation of a Gaussian mixture model. Such encoding is later used for specifying both the desired state of the robot, and an optimal feedback control law that exploits the variability in position, velocity and force spaces observed during the demonstrations. The whole framework allows the robot to modify its movements as a function of parameters of the task, while showing different impedance behaviors. Tests were successfully carried out in a scenario where a 7 DOF backdrivable manipulator learns to cooperate with a human to transport an object.",

        "abstract": "In this paper, an approach for learning optimal striking points is proposed. Based on a ball-flight model and a rebound model, a set of reachable striking points within the robot's workspace can be obtained. However, while these striking points are geometrically reachable, their success probability differs substantially due to the robot's nonlinear dynamics, the distance to the ball, the need to reach sufficient velocity as well as the right angle at interception and non-uniform sensitivity to errors. Thus, it is crucial for a ping-pong robotic system to select striking points well. As a successful ball interception is the result of various factors that cannot be modeled straightforwardly, we suggest determining optimal striking points based on a reward function that measures how well the ping-pong ball's trajectory and the racket's movement coincidence. In this approach, we propose to learn a stochastic policy over the reward given the prospective striking point in order to facilitate exploration of a wide range of prospective striking points. The resulting learning method takes both the amount of experience data and its confidence into account to reach optimal solutions reliably. Evaluation with a real robotic system demonstrates the applicability of the proposed method.",

        "abstract": "With robots leaving factory environments and entering less controlled domains, possibly sharing living space with humans, safety needs to be guaranteed. To this end, some form of awareness of their body surface and the space surrounding it is desirable. In this work, we present a unique method that lets a robot learn a distributed representation of space around its body (or peripersonal space) by exploiting a whole-body artificial skin and through physical contact with the environment. Every taxel (tactile element) has a visual receptive field anchored to it. Starting from an initially blank state, the distance of every object entering this receptive field is visually perceived and recorded, together with information whether the object has eventually contacted the particular skin area or not. This gives rise to a set of probabilities that are updated incrementally and that carry information about the likelihood of particular events in the environment contacting a particular set of taxels. The learned representation naturally serves the purpose of predicting contacts with the whole body of the robot, which is of clear behavioral relevance. Furthermore, we devised a simple avoidance controller that is triggered by this representation, thus endowing a robot with a \u201cmargin of safety\u201d around its body. Finally, simply reversing the sign in the controller we used gives rise to simple \u201creaching\u201d for objects in the robot's vicinity, which automatically proceeds with the most activated (closest) body part.",

Our method models the set of fault-triggering inputs as a Cartesian product and identifies this set by actively querying the system under test. The active sampling scheme is very efficient in the common case that few fields in the interface are relevant to causing the fault. This scheme also solves the problem of efficiently finding sufficient examples to model rare faults, which is problematic for other learning-based methods. Compared to other techniques, ours requires no parameter turning or post-processing in order to produce useful results. We analyze the method qualitatively, theoretically, and empirically. An experimental evaluation demonstrates superior performance and reliability compared to a basic decision tree approach. We also briefly discuss how the method has assisted in debugging a commercial autonomous ground vehicle system.",

        "abstract": "One of the major goals for mobile robots is to be able to traverse any kind of terrains. A possible way to achieve this goal is by the use of legged robots, as they have increased mobility. However, this would require them to be able to modify their gaits, based on the identification of the terrain that they are currently traversing. In this paper, we introduce a number of novel methods to address this issue of autonomous terrain classification and clustering, based on tactile data collected with a walking robot. The proposed learning methods are based on the Pitman-Yor process mixture of Gaussians, a Bayesian nonparametric prior, well-suited for density estimation. This model is initially used to learn the non-Gaussian distribution of the features produced from proprioceptive (force/torque) signals from the legs, registered during the interaction of one robot foot with a terrain. Then, we exploit its capacity on clustering and discovering structures in the data to identify terrains in the feature space. Experiments were conducted on a six-legged robot, thus demonstrating the applicability of the Pitman-Yor process mixture of Gaussians for terrain identification. In particular, we obtained a classification success rate of 82% and 51% accuracy, with our supervised learning and unsupervised learning approach respectively.",

Specifically, we examine the domain of UAV traffic management in urban airspaces. Each robot does not explicitly coordinate with other vehicles in the airspace. Instead, the robots execute their own individual internal cost-based planner to travel between locations. Given this structure, our goal is to develop a high-level UAV traffic management (UTM) system that can dynamically adapt the cost space to reduce the number of conflict incidents in the airspace without knowing the internal planners of each robot. We propose a decentralized and distributed system of high-level traffic controllers that each learn appropriate costing strategies via a neuro-evolutionary algorithm. The policies learned by our algorithm demonstrated a 16.4% reduction in the total number of conflict incidents experienced in the airspace while maintaining throughput performance.",

        "abstract": "This paper examines the design of a parallel spring-loaded actuated linkage intended for dynamically dexterous legged robotics applications. Targeted at toe placement in the sagittal plane, the mechanism applies two direct-drive brushless dc motors to a symmetric five bar linkage arranged to power free tangential motion and compliant radial motion associated with running, leaping, and related agile locomotion behaviors. Whereas traditional leg design typically decouples the consideration of motor sizing, kinematics and compliance, we examine their conjoined influence on three key characteristics of the legged locomotion cycle: transducing battery energy to body energy during stance; mitigating collision losses upon toe touchdown; and storing and harvesting prior body energy in the spring during stance. This analysis leads to an unconventional design whose \u201cknee\u201d joint rides above the \u201chip\u201d joint. Experiments demonstrate that the resulting mechanism can deliver more than half again as much kinetic energy to the body (or more than double the kinetic energy if the full workspace is used), and offers a five-fold increase in energy storage and collision efficiency relative to the conventional design.",

        "track": "main",
        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "Manipulation of deformable objects is a widely applicable but challenging task in robotics. One promising nonparametric approach for this problem is trajectory transfer, in which a non-rigid registration is computed between the starting scene of the demonstration and the scene at test time. This registration is extrapolated to find a function from \u211d3 to \u211d3, which is then used to warp the demonstrated robot trajectory to generate a proposed trajectory to execute in the test scene. In prior work [1] [2], only depth information from the scenes has been used to compute this warp function. This approach ignores appearance information, but there are situations in which using both shape and appearance information is necessary for finding high quality non-rigid warp functions. In this paper, we describe an approach to learn relevant appearance information about deformable objects using deep learning, and use this additional information to improve the quality of non-rigid registration between demonstration and test scenes. Our method better registers areas of interest on deformable objects that are crucial for manipulation, such as rope crossings and towel corners and edges. We experimentally validate our approach in both simulation and in the real world, and show that the utilization of appearance information leads to a significant improvement in both selecting the best matching demonstration scene for a given test scene, and finding a high quality non-rigid registration between those two scenes.",

        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "The fidelity with which series elastic actuators (SEAs) render desired impedances is important. Numerous approaches to SEA impedance control have been developed under the premise that high-precision actuator torque control is a prerequisite. Indeed, the design of an inner torque compensator has a significant impact on actuator impedance rendering. The disturbance observer (DOB) based torque control implemented in NASA's Valkyrie robot is considered here and a mathematical model of this torque control, cascaded with an outer impedance compensator, is constructed. While previous work has examined the impact a disturbance observer has on torque control performance, little has been done regarding DOBs and impedance rendering accuracy. Both simulation and a series of experiments are used to demonstrate the significant improvements possible in an SEA's ability to render desired dynamic behaviors when utilizing a DOB. Actuator transparency at low impedances is improved, closed loop hysteresis is reduced, and the actuator's dynamic response to both commands and interaction torques more faithfully matches that of the desired model. All of this is achieved by leveraging DOB based control rather than increasing compensator gains, thus making improved SEA impedance control easier to achieve in practice.",

The proposed arm design allows for estimating payload mass, as well as detecting collisions against obstacles in the forearm. The compliant arm design is intended to be applied in aerial manipulation and transportation, being mounted on the base of an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) like a multirotor or a small autonomous helicopter. The payload mass estimation can be useful in the adaptation and stabilization of UAV altitude and attitude controllers when objects of unknown weight are grasped by the arm, while compliance reduces the effect of physical interaction when lifting an object on UAV stability. The paper addresses the mechanical design and construction of a three DoF arm prototype (elbow, wrist roll and pitch), deriving the equations for estimating the payload mass. A set of experiments for payload mass estimation and collision detection and reaction have been performed to test the validity of the approach.",

This problem has many real-world applications including that of a co-bot engaged in a follow-the-leader behavior or a robot that is participating in a convoy. If the robot is expected to eventually break away and reach its own goal, then the robot must stay self-localized. A key challenge for localization while tailing another is the extreme and persistent occlusion of the robot's sensors by the dynamic obstacle in front of it that is not modeled in its map. Current Monte Carlo localization (MCL) methods use sensor models with random noise, which are inadequate under such occlusion. We utilize a particle filter that simultaneously tracks the subject robot and the leader. We introduce novel particle weighting and adaptive sampling schemes that significantly improve the follower's localization. The result is a robust and adaptive MCL for applications involving persistent occlusion.",

Only short range traversable regions can be detected using traditional methods based on stereo vision because of the limited image resolution and baseline of stereo vision. In this paper, we propose a novel method to detect long range traversable regions without using any supervised or self-supervised learning process. Superpixels are clustered using an improved spectral clustering algorithm to segment the image effectively, and after integrating short range traversable region detection based on u-v-disparity, the traversable region can be extended to long range naturally. The experimental results show that the proposed method works well in different outdoor/field environments, and the detecting range can be improved greatly in comparison with traditional methods. Furthermore, the proposed superpixels clustering algorithm can also be applied in other robot vision tasks like road detection and object recognition.",

Daily geometric maps with the same coordinate frame were generated with SLAM, and in a similar manner, daily affordance density maps (places people use) were generated with the output of a human tracker running on the robot. The contribution of the paper is two-fold: an approach to detect geometric changes to cluster them in similar geometric configurations and the building of geometric and affordance composite maps on each cluster. This approach avoids the loss of long term retrieved information. Geometric similarity was computed using a normal distance approach on the maps. The analysis was performed on data collected by a mobile robot for a period of 4 months accumulating data equivalent to 70 days. Experimental results show that the system is capable of detecting geometric changes in the environment and clustering similar geometric configurations.",

        "abstract": "While humanoid robots and various associated algorithms for gait control and motion planning have been considered in the prior literature, the possibility of utilizing a low-profile crawling gait to operate in tight spaces (e.g., going under obstacles) has not been considered previously and enables new capabilities of the humanoid robot. In this paper, a new gait for humanoid robots is presented that enables humanoid motion in tight spaces that are vertically constrained. The gait is laterally symmetric and utilizes a cooperative motion of both the hands and feet. The addition of this gait expands the set of environments that can be handled by the humanoid robot. The efficacy of the proposed gait is demonstrated experimentally on a NAO humanoid robot.",

        "abstract": "Sensorimotor coupling is ubiquitous in living organisms. Sensory and motor systems are utterly useless if left without the presence of the other. One crucial faculty that organisms have developed with tremendous ecological advantages is the ability to discern between the origins of perceptual input as being originated by the environment or the organism itself, provided by resource efficient sensor and motor systems. This ability has been shown to be implemented through a specialized circuit (forward model) receiving a copy of the motor command (corollary discharge). We propose a fast method to derive a resource constrained forward model by framing sensorimotor coupling as a low-rank approximation of an overly detailed forward model. By framing the problem as a factorization approach we can resort to currently available off-the-shelf solvers for matrix factorization. We experimentally show that by solving the problem as a low-rank approximation we obtain more than an order of magnitude speed up relatively to minimizing the objective function with gradient descent methods. The development of resource constrained and ecologically adapted sensorimotor systems is essential for the deployment of low-cost energy efficient autonomous robots for the execution of specific tasks in particular environments.",

        "abstract": "For intelligent robots to solve real-world tasks, they need to manipulate multiple objects, and perform diverse manipulation actions apart from rigid transfers, such as pushing and sliding. Planning these tasks requires discrete changes between actions, and continuous, collision-free paths that fulfill action-specific constraints. In this work, we propose a multi-modal path planner, named MOPL, which accepts generic definitions of primitive actions with different types of contact manifolds, and randomly spans its search trees through these subspaces. Our evaluation shows that this generic search technique allows MOPL to solve several challenging scenarios over different types of kinematics and tools with reasonable performance. Furthermore, we demonstrate MOPL by solving and executing plans in two real-world experimental setups.",

The algorithm guides the exploration so that it draws more samples from the relevant region as the number of iterations increases. The approach works in two steps: first, it predicts if a given sample is collision-free (classification phase) without calling the collision-checker, and it then estimates if it is a promising sample, i.e., if it has the potential to improve the current best solution (regression phase), without solving the local steering problem. The proposed exploration strategy is integrated to the RRT# algorithm. Numerical simulations demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed approach.",

To transport the drugs, we use therapeutic magnetic boluses composed of magnetic particle aggregates as navigable agents controlled by magnetic gradients. Based on the optimal design of the bolus, an experimental investigation is carried out in millimeter-sized fluidic artery vessels to demonstrate the steerability of the magnetic bolus under different velocity, shear-stress and trajectory constraints with a laminar viscous fluidic environment.",

The comparative studies show that the control performance yielded by the FUZZY P+ID controller is superior. We replace the existing PID controller implemented on the towing winch with the FUZZY P + ID controller for burying cable tasks at speed up to 1 knot under sea waves with significant variations (peak-to-peak) from 1.5 to 2.5 meters. The real applications demonstrate that the FUZZY P + ID controller is much more robust than the conventional PID controller.",

Key issues in map merging are the transformation of the coordinate frame of each submap to a global coordinate frame and the rejection of outliers (false arcs) in a pose graph. The proposed method reduces outliers using cycle consistency constraints. To cope with the exponential increase of cycles, cycle consistency check is applied iteratively with a limited number of chordless cycles. Then, spanning trees having only inlier arcs are selected by RANSAC to find the transformation of each submap to a global coordinate frame. Experiments using public datasets show that the proposed method successfully obtained good spanning trees at high outlier ratio.",

The paper describes an approach to the acquisition of such panoramic images using a robotic platform that collects sequences of depth images with a commodity depth sensor. These sequences are stitched into panoramic images that efficiently capture scene information while reducing noise in the captured imagery. Scene structure is extracted from the panoramas and used to register a collection of panoramas to obtain coverage of extended areas. The presented approach maintains fine geometry detail in 3D reconstructions, uses a modest amount of memory, and enjoys excellent scaling characteristics across large environments.",

        "abstract": "We consider the problem of a human-following robot in which a human is equipped with a low-fidelity odometry sensor and a robot follows the human leader - often lagging well behind and out of visual contact with the human. The challenge is for the robot to determine the path taken by the human, despite the relatively noisy odometry data available. Such a system is useful in a \u201cpack mule\u201d application, where the robot carries a heavy load for the human. Our key idea is to equip the robot with sensors allowing it to build a map, and to use observations of the environment structure to constrain the path of the human. We propose and evaluate several approaches: a particle filter method that extends monte-carlo localization approaches, and a multi-hypothesis maximum-likelihood approach based on stochastic gradient descent optimization that efficiently clusters similar trajectories. We demonstrate that our proposed approaches are able to track human trajectories in several synthetic and real-world datasets.",

        "abstract": "In this paper we present experimentally obtained cable-pulley Coulomb and viscous friction for cable-driven surgical robotic systems including the RAVEN II surgical robotic research platform. In the study of controlling cable-driven systems a simple mathematical model which does not capture physical behavior well is often employed. Even though control of such systems is achievable without an accurate model, fully understanding the behavior of the system will potentially realize more robust control. A surgical robot is one of the systems that often relies on cables as an actuation method as well as pulleys to guide them. Systems with such structure encounter frictional force related to conditions of cable and pulley such as cable velocity, tension, type and number of pulley, and angle of cable wrapping around pulley. Using a couple of test platforms that incorporate cable, pulleys, and other experimental conditions corresponding to the RAVEN II system, it is shown that cable-pulley friction is function of tension, wrap angle, and number of pulleys and not of magnitude of cable velocity.",

        "abstract": "Robust fingertip force detection from fingernail image is a critical strategy that can be applied in many areas. However, prior research fixed many variables that influence the finger color change. This paper analyzes the effect of the finger joint on the force detection in order to deal with the constrained finger position setting. A force estimator method is designed: a model to predict the fingertip force from finger joints measured from 2D cameras and 3 rectangular markers in cooperation with the fingernail images are trained. Then the error caused by the color changes of the joint bending can be avoided. This strategy is a significant step forward from a finger force estimator that requires tedious finger joint setting. The approach is evaluated experimentally. The result shows that it increases the accuracy over 10% for the force in conditions of the finger joint free movement. The estimator is used to demonstrate lifting and replacing objects with various weights.",

Since it may lead to the mechanical characteristics changes of the cell itself due to the intracellular pressure changes, we focus on constructing the mechanical characteristics measurement system of Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803, one of unicellular cyanobacteria. There are two important issues in constructing the system. Because of features of the cyanobacteria, which is a kind of floating cell whose diameter is a few micrometer, one is how to transport the cell to the measurement point. The other is how to deform the target cell. In this paper, we propose the system combining optical tweezers for transportation of the target cell with the robot integrated microfluidic chip (robochip). The robochip contains an on-chip probe actuated by an external actuator, and a force sensor. We present the concept of the total system, and demonstrated the results of mechanical characterization of a single cyanobacteria.",

Robot intrinsic accuracy, CT scan accuracy and two methods of robot tool positioning with aid of the optical tracking system (OTS) are measured. Measurements show RMS error of the robot (0.669 mm) is decreased 55.4% when guided with OTS using a single marker probe (0.29 mm) and 40.5% when using OTS with relative referencing (0.39 mm). RMS error of the CT scan readings is 0.46 mm.",

In this paper, we present a novel approach that instead uses geo-tagged panoramas from the Google Street View as a source of global positioning. We model the problem of localization as a non-linear least squares estimation in two phases. The first estimates the 3D position of tracked feature points from short monocular camera sequences. The second computes the rigid body transformation between the Street View panoramas and the estimated points. The only input of this approach is a stream of monocular camera images and odometry estimates. We quantified the accuracy of the method by running the approach on a robotic platform in a parking lot by using visual fiducials as ground truth. Additionally, we applied the approach in the context of personal localization in a real urban scenario by using data from a Google Tango tablet.",

        "abstract": "Performance benchmarking has become an important topic within robotics. It is indeed, a critical way to compare different solutions under different conditions. In this paper, we focus on performance benchmarking of multi-robot systems which explore and map unknown terrains. We present a collection of metrics to objectively compare different algorithms that can be applied to collaborative multi-robot exploration. We also identify parameters that impact robotic fleet performances. By varying the parameters, we can identify strengths and limits of an algorithm. This work is also a first concrete step to address the general problem of objectively comparing different multi-robot coordination algorithms. We illustrate these contributions with realistic simulations of the frontier-based exploration strategy. The simulations were implemented in ROS, which enables to uncouple the control software from the drivers of the robot body. We can therefore use the same code on both simulation and real robots.",

        "abstract": "3D posture estimation for a hose-shaped robot is critical in rescue activities due to complex physical environments. Conventional sound-based posture estimation assumes rather flat physical environments and focuses only on 2D, resulting in poor performance in real world environments with rubble. This paper presents novel 3D posture estimation by exploiting microphones and accelerometers. The idea of our method is to compensate the lack of posture information obtained by sound-based time-difference-of arrival (TDOA) with the tilt information obtained from accelerometers. This compensation is formulated as a nonlinear state-space model and solved by the unscented Kalman filter. Experiments are conducted by using a 3m hose-shaped robot with eight units of a microphone and an accelerometer and seven units of a loudspeaker and a vibration motor deployed in a simple 3D structure. Experimental results demonstrate that our method reduces the errors of initial states to about 20 cm in the 3D space. If the initial errors of initial states are less than 20 %, our method can estimate the correct 3D posture in real-time.",

        "abstract": "This paper presents a new control method devoted to improve the performances of 2-DOF piezoelectric actuator for precise positioning tasks. The piezoelectric actuator exhibits strong cross-couplings between its two axes and strong hysteresis and creep nonlinearities. These unwanted phenomena undeniably compromised therefore the final precision of the targeted tasks (micromanipulation) and should be conveniently accounted during the controller synthesis. In this paper, we proposed a combination of the discrete linear Kalman filtering with a closed-loop scheme to suppress the effects of the couplings and of the nonlinearities. The suggested method permits to improve the performances of the piezoelectric actuator without specific and detailed characterization and knowledges on the hysteresis and on the creep models. Extensive experiments were carried out with complex desired trajectories and demonstrate the efficiency of the novel approach.",

        "abstract": "This paper presents a new soft-bodied millimeterscale swimmer actuated by rotating uniform magnetic fields. The proposed swimmer moves through internal undulatory deformations, resulting from a magnetization profile programmed into its body. To understand the motion of the swimmer, a mathematical model is developed to describe the general relationship between the deflection of a flexible strip and its magnetization profile. As a special case, the situation of the swimmer on the water surface is analyzed and predictions made by the model are experimentally verified. Experimental results show the controllability of the proposed swimmer under a computer vision-based closed-loop controller. The swimmers have nominal dimensions of 1.5\u00d74.9\u00d70.06 mm and a top speed of 50 mm/s (10 body lengths per second). Waypoint following and multiagent control are demonstrated for swimmers constrained at the air-water interface and underwater swimming is also shown, suggesting the promising potential of this type of swimmer in biomedical and microfluidic applications.",

However, during the bending the manipulator sweeps over a region, where sensitive organs may locate. This raises the safety concern. In this paper, a motion planning algorithm focusing on minimize the sweeping area for flexible serpentine manipulators is presented. Particularly, a three dimensional backward average neural dynamic model (BANDM) is proposed to build minimum sweeping area planning field in the configuration space of the serpentine manipulator. Given a target position, the motion sequence is generated automatically based on the established planning field. The simulations and experimental results validate the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed planning approach over conventional planning algorithms in terms of sweeping area with keeping target reach and obstacle avoidance.",

        "abstract": "A precise calibration method for optical high-speed gaze controllers using rotational mirrors is proposed. The mirror-based pan/tilt camera can change gaze direction more quickly than a conventional pan-tilt-zoom camera, which actuates the camera itself. The high-speed gaze controller can track moving objects at high magnification and can utilize new applications of three-dimensional measurement. However, the controller is difficult to calibrate owing to shallow depth of field (DOF) at close focus positions and mechanical differences. We propose to control optics and illumination to detect calibration pattern control points precisely against shallow DOF; we deepen the DOF using a small aperture, coaxial episcopic illumination, and a retroreflective checkerboard pattern. We introduce mirror thickness for an exact gaze control model and bundle adjustment for large center-of-projection translation. We confirm that wide gaze range calibration is achieved more accurately than when mirror thickness is not considered.",

Robots can be enhanced with additional virtual capabilities, or can interact with humans without sharing physical space. We demonstrate Mixed Reality with three representative experiments, each of which highlights the advantages of our approach.

        "abstract": "In recent years, the demand for rocket launching has increased due to the development of space technology. However, using inexpensive rockets is not always possible. Although the cost of solid-propellant rockets is relatively reasonable, safely manufacturing a large amount of solid propellant is difficult, and the manufacturing process is disjointed. Therefore, safe and continues manufacturing of solid propellant is necessary. On the basis of the movements of the intestinal tract, we realized that the movements required for transport and mixing of solid propellants are possible to achieve without the application of a large force. By mimicking these intestinal movements, we can safely and continuously manufacture a large amount of solid propellant. We developed a peristaltic pump, based on bowel peristalsis, using straight-fiber-type artificial muscle, and in this study, we demonstrate the usefulness of this pump for transporting the highly viscous fluids and solid-liquid mixed fluid. We consider that the peristaltic pump can also be effectively used as a mixing device. In this paper, we show that mixing one highly viscous fluid with another is possible by measuring the luminance values. In the manufacturing process, we use glass beads with the same diameter as microparticles and a sodium polyacrylate aqueous solution resembling a high viscosity fluid or hydroxyl-terminated polybutadiene as the raw material in the solid propellant. We then measure the glass beads in the resulting solid-liquid mixed fluid.",

        "abstract": "In this paper we present a new method to control instantaneously MIMO oscillating systems. The algorithm and its hardware configuration are implemented on a multidimensional resonant force sensor. The robotic applications of this sensor require real-time resonant frequency measures. Inspired by the technique used in single quartz crystal oscillator, the method is extended to the MIMO case and is presented as an alternative solution to control multiple resonances of a force sensor. Three frequencies of one single active plate, on which several piezoelectric patches are bonded, are simultaneously excited. The method uses spatial modal decoupling technique implemented with analogue electronics thanks to a smart arrangement of the piezoelectric patches. This allows the full MIMO system to be transformed into three independent SISO subsystems. Then, for each of them, a controller is tuned to reinforce self-oscillation of the force sensor system to several resonant working points in a closed-loop configuration. Finally, experimental verification shows that the method can be successfully used for the control of a new type of resonant force sensors.",

        "abstract": "This paper presents a non-linear, dynamic model of the flexure-based transmission in the Harvard Ambulatory Microrobot (HAMR). The model is derived from first principles and has led to a more comprehensive understanding of the components in this transmission. In particular, an empirical model of the dynamic properties of the compliant Kapton flexures is developed and verified against theoretical results from beam and vibration theory. Furthermore, the fabrication of the piezoelectric bending actuators that drive the transmission is improved to match theoretical performance predictions. The transmission model is validated against experimental data taken on HAMR for the quasi-static (1\u201310 Hz) operating mode, and is used to redesign the transmission for improved performance in this regime. The model based redesign results in a 266% increase in the work done by the foot when compared to a previous version of HAMR. This leads to a payload capacity of 2.9g, which is \u223c 2\u00d7 the robot's mass and a 114% increase. Finally, the model is validated in the dynamic regime (40\u2013150 Hz) and the merits of a second order linear approximation are discussed.",

        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "Physical interaction in robotics is a complex problem that requires not only accurate reproduction of the kinematic trajectories but also of the forces and torques exhibited during the movement. We base our approach on Movement Primitives (MP), as MPs provide a framework for modelling complex movements and introduce useful operations on the movements, such as generalization to novel situations, time scaling, and others. Usually, MPs are trained with imitation learning, where an expert demonstrates the trajectories. However, MPs used in physical interaction either require additional learning approaches, e.g., reinforcement learning, or are based on handcrafted solutions. Our goal is to learn and generate movements for physical interaction that are learned with imitation learning, from a small set of demonstrated trajectories. The Probabilistic Movement Primitives (ProMPs) framework is a recent MP approach that introduces beneficial properties, such as combination and blending of MPs, and represents the correlations present in the movement. The ProMPs provides a variable stiffness controller that reproduces the movement but it requires a dynamics model of the system. Learning such a model is not a trivial task, and, therefore, we introduce the model-free ProMPs, that are learning jointly the movement and the necessary actions from a few demonstrations. We derive a variable stiffness controller analytically. We further extent the ProMPs to include force and torque signals, necessary for physical interaction. We evaluate our approach in simulated and real robot tasks.",

        "abstract": "This paper focuses on various control strategies for a modular cable-articulated parallel robotic manipulator called PACER (Parallel Articulated-Cable Exercise Robot). The proposed robotic device is comprised of multiple cables and a single antagonistically actuated prismatic joint which connects a six degrees-of-freedom moving platform to a fixed base. This novel design provides an attractive architecture for implementation of a home-based rehabilitation device as an alternative to expensive serial robots. In this paper, after deriving the dynamic equations via Newton-Euler formulation, the development of different control strategies in the context of upper limb rehabilitation in three-dimensional space will be examined. The various control modes include: (i) passive mode through feedback linearization for recovering functionalities of the joints at the first step of post-stroke rehabilitation, (ii) active mode via admittance controller for assisting patient to do tasks better, and finally (iii) resistive mode via stiffness controller for increasing the muscle strength. This is now evaluated via a simulation case-study and development of a physical testbed is underway. Since the human arm consists of seven degrees-of-freedom, and daily activities of upper limbs are combination of motions of these simple joints, this proposed design with various control strategies has enormous potential for neurological remapping and brain plasticity in post-stroke patients with upper limb injuries.",

After the presentation of the basic properties of the twisted string actuation system, the way how they are used for the implementation of a variable stiffness joint is discussed. A simple PID-based motor-side algorithm for controlling simultaneously both the joint stiffness and position is discussed, then the identification of the system parameters is performed on an experimental setup for verifying the proposed model and control approach.",

        "abstract": "In this work we present an obstacle detection and tracking solution applied to Automated Guided Vehicles (AGVs) in industrial environments. The proposed method relies on information provided by an omnidirectional stereo vision system enabling 360 degree perception around the AGV. The stereo data is transformed into a classified digital elevation map (DEM). Based on this intermediate representation we are able to generate a set of obstacle hypotheses, each represented by a 3D cuboid and a free-form polygonal model. The cuboidal model is used for the classification of each hypothesis as \u201cPedestrian\u201d, \u201cAGV\u201d, \u201cLarge Obstacle\u201d or \u201cSmall Obstacle\u201d, while the free-form polylines are used for object motion estimation relying on an Iterative Closest Point (ICP) method. The obtained measurements are subjected to a Kalman filter based tracking approach, in which the data association takes into account also the classification results.",

        "abstract": "To gain high mobility on challenging terrains, a mobile robot based on eccentric paddle mechanism (ePaddle) with locomotion versatility has been proposed. In this paper, a paddle-aided stair-climbing motion is presented for this ePaddle-based robot. The robot can roll on the stair as a traditional wheeled vehicle and also can climb up the stair under the help of its paddles. Robot-stair interaction modes are presented and typical feasible postures of the robot in stair-climbing are discussed. Frictional requirements for the robot to hold a desired posture are evaluated by modelling statics of the robot. Analyzed results reveal that two critical scenarios in wheeled mode occur when the front-wheel is at the bottom of the riser, and when the rear-wheel is at the top of the riser, respectively. In contrast, frictional requirements of the paddle-aided stair-climbing postures confirm that the robot can climb up the stair with all feasible postures by touching the stair with the paddle, which verifies the effectiveness of the proposed paddle-aided stair-climbing.",

The 5-DoF passive structure has three translations and two rotations (T3R2) that allows the surgeon to manually place the endoscope near to the entry point during. The 4-DoF motorized structure (T2R2) actively controls the endoscope's position based on the surgeon's input commands. We analyze the reciprocal screw of the passive and active structures. The motion control system is based on a real-time Linux kernel that processes the commands from the surgeon and controls the manipulator's active joints. A user control interface based on an IMU fastened on the surgeon's foot is developed; this interface measures the foot's posture and through a series of gestures, it provides the desired pan/tilt/zoom motions of the camera. The developed endoscope manipulator allows the surgeon to conduct \u2018two-hand\u2019 operations while retaining direct control of the camera. We present an experimental study to validate the performance of the robotic prototype.",

        "abstract": "Modular Robot Manipulators are user-configurable manipulators which provide rapid design and inexpensive implementation. To be easy-use, smart actuators embedded with position input and position feedback controller are adopted, these local controllers render the manipulators position controlled, but also result in limited performance and precision. This paper targets the case that the built-in controller does not provide desirable precision for set-point regulation. Firstly a joint-level model is established, of which the nominal model can be identified with derivative observer based on the position feedback, then an auxiliary adaptive controller coping with parametric uncertainty is proposed which leads to an error close to zero, a switching control strategy is introduced considering the actuator saturation. The proposed control method is implemented on a 5-DOF modular manipulator, with comparison to classic integral controller.",

However, understanding and managing the safety information of a robot is not a trivial task. The quantity of this information is large, and it is usually stored in text-based formats. These factors mean that maintaining safety information when it changes is error prone, and understanding it requires manually searching through lengthy reports. In this paper, we demonstrate that a robot's safety information can be stored in a model-based format. We use the SafeML modelling language to model the results of a safety analysis performed on a semi-autonomous wheelchair. We then illustrate and discuss the benefits of storing and managing safety information using a model, both to maintainability of the information and to understanding the safety of the robot.",

Collaboration models can potentially include multiple agents working towards a shared objective - a scenario referred to as multilateral manipulation. In this work, we examine multilateral manipulation in the task of debridement: removing dead tissue or damaged tissue fragments to allow remaining healthy tissue to heal. We extended our previously developed multilateral manipulation software framework to the task of debridement and implemented four different collaboration models: (1) fully autonomous debridement, (2) shared control between a human and robotic agent, (3) supervised control where the operator identifies foreign bodies to be excised, and (4) teleoperation. We demonstrate these collaboration models with the RAVEN-II robot, an open-architecture surgical robot with two cable-driven 7-DOF arms. Each collaboration model included methods to remove foreign bodies from the field of view of a stereoscopic camera setup. Results indicate tradeoffs in experiment duration, hardware requirements, and safety implications among the four collaboration models.",

        "abstract": "The execution of long-horizon tasks under uncertainty is a fundamental challenge in robotics. Recent approaches have made headway on these tasks with an integration of task and motion planning. In this paper, we present Interfaced Belief Space Planning (IBSP): a modular approach to task and motion planning in belief space. We use a task-independent interface layer to combine an off-the-shelf classical planner with motion planning and inference. We determinize the problem under the maximum likelihood observation assumption to obtain a deterministic representation where successful plans generate goal-directed observations. We leverage properties of maximum likelihood observation determinizations to obtain a simple representation of (optimistic) belief space dynamics that is well-suited to planning. Our interface is implemented with standard belief state queries, requiring only the ability to sample, compute unnormalized likelihoods, and compute maximum likelihood states. Our contribution is a novel algorithm for task and motion planning in belief space that has minimal dependence on the details of the inference engine used. IBSP can work with a broad class of black box state estimators, with zero changes to the algorithm. We validate our approach in simulated tasks for the PR2 that account for continuous state, different types of initial state distributions, and negative observations.",

The mechanism propels itself forward by oscillating its inner body in a symmetric fashion using a single actuator. The paper starts by using a simple model to investigate the dynamics of the robot and to simulate its motion. Next, we simulate various design parameters and conclude that some parameters can improve the performance of the swimming robot. We conclude with a proof-of-concept prototype that is capable of swimming similar to the predicted model. Moreover, by using an asymmetric input, the mechanism is able to rotate in various curvatures. The combination of these forward and rotational gaits can be used to stabilize the robot onto a desired trajectory.",

Rather than combining these functions as an afterthought, we design sensors and actuators into the robot at the onset, both reducing fabrication complexity and optimizing component interactions. We utilize liquid metal strain sensors and pneumatic actuators embedded into a silicone robotic gripper. The robot's body is formed by curing the silicone in complex 3D printed molds. We show that the liquid metal strain gauges provide a repeatable resistance response during robotic actuation. We further show that, given sufficient control over other time-dependent variables, it is possible to determine when the robot begins gripping an object during actuation.",

In this paper, we address the localization problem when the map of the environment is not present beforehand, and the robot relies on a hand-drawn map from a non-expert user. We addressed this problem by expressing the robot pose in the pixel coordinate and simultaneously estimate a local deformation of the hand-drawn map. Experiments show that we can successfully identify the room in which the robot is located in 80% of the tests.",

        "abstract": "Helical microswimmers capable of propulsion at low Reynolds numbers have been proposed for numerous applications. Several different kinds of helical swimmers inspired by E. coli bacteria have been proposed by researchers, and most of them have rigid helical tails. However, high softness could make swimmers more adaptive in confined environments for biomedical applications. This paper aims to study the morphologies and the swimming characteristics of magnetically actuated swimmers with belt-like soft tails initially straight at low Reynolds numbers. We found that a swimmer with a soft tail during rotations shows different morphologies: a twisted shape until the input frequency increases to a threshold frequency, and a helical shape until a step-out frequency. Beyond the stepout frequency, the shape of the soft tail becomes irregular. The soft tail swimmers with different lengths show similar swimming velocities at same rotational frequencies. However, their maximal swimming velocities are different because of the varied step-out frequencies. The interactions between the soft tails reduce the swimming velocity, and this influence increases with the rotational frequency. Thus, the swimming performance is not improved by doubling the number of soft tails in our experiments.",

This pattern not only occupies lots of the orthodontist's labor time, but also can not ensure the accuracy of the appliances. Therefore, a robotic system was developed for automatic and accurate orthodontic archwire bending in our study. First, a method for customized archwire parameterization was developed. Second, an adaptive sampling-based bending planner with collision checker in time-varying environment was designed. Finally, a bending control strategy was used to eliminate the springback effect of the archwires and bending point shift during the bending process. A self-developed simulation platform based on Robot Operating System with MoveIt was used for preliminary validation of the proposed method. Physical experiments for multi-functional orthodontic bends on the robotic system were conducted as well. The results have shown that the developed robotic system using the proposed planning and control method was able to accomplish the automatic and accurate orthodontic archwire bending.",

The considered surgical robot is a dual-arm prototype developed with a redundant and modular mechanical structure, designed to be reconfigured for different surgical tasks, and with a hybrid parallel/serial kinematics. The motion planning solution proposed in the paper includes both an online collision-free path planner, based on the RRT-Connect algorithm, and a generator of predefined motion primitives. This solution allows the multi-arm robot to autonomously execute the complex motion patterns required for a suturing task. Since such motion patterns are specified in the Cartesian space, an efficient and univocal solution of the inverse kinematics of the robot, which is a challenging problem due to its hybrid structure, is another crucial issue addressed in the paper.",

        "abstract": "Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer-related death, and early-stage diagnosis is critical to survival. Biopsy is typically required for a definitive diagnosis, but current low-risk clinical options for lung biopsy cannot access all biopsy sites. We introduce a motion planner for a multilumen transoral lung access system, a new system that has the potential to perform safe biopsies anywhere in the lung, which could enable more effective early-stage diagnosis of lung cancer. The system consists of three stages in which a bronchoscope is deployed transorally to the lung, a concentric tube robot pierces through the bronchial tubes into the lung parenchyma, and a steerable needle deploys through a properly oriented concentric tube and steers through the lung parenchyma to the target site while avoiding anatomical obstacles such as significant blood vessels. A sampling-based motion planner computes actions for each stage of the system and considers the coupling of the stages in an efficient manner. We demonstrate the motion planner's fast performance and ability to compute plans with high clearance from obstacles in simulated anatomical scenarios.",

        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "The exploitation of new fields of application in addition to traditional industrial production for robot manipulators (e.g. agriculture, human areas) requires extensions to the sensor as well as to the planning capabilities. Motion planning solely based on visual information performs poorly in cluttered environments since contacts with obstacles might be inevitable and thus a distinction between hard and soft objects has to be made. In our contribution we present a novel intrinsic tactile sensing module mounted on a multipurpose 9 DOF agricultural manipulator. With its innovative sensor arrangement we consider it to be a low-cost, easily manageable and efficient solution with a reasonable abstraction layer in comparison to complex torque sensing or tactile skins. The sensor provides information about the resulting force and torque. In the second part of our paper, the tactile information is used for minimizing contact forces while pursuing the end-effector tasks as long as reasonable. Hence, we present robust and efficient extensions to Resolved Motion Rate Control for real-time application. We introduce a general formulation providing control inputs in task-space, joint-space and nullspace. Thus, we design a suitable controller by feedback linearization and feed-forward terms. Results from real-world experiments show the potential of our approach. A discussion of the different control schemes completes the paper.",

        "abstract": "Continuum tubular robots, which are constructed by telescoping pre-curved elastic tubes, are capable of balancing the force application and steerability during minimally invasive surgeries. These devices are able to reach the desired surgical sites in body cavities without colliding with critical blood vessels, nerves and tissues. However, the motion planning of continuum tubular robots is quite challenging because of their complicated kinematics as well as the high dimensional configuration space. In this paper, a sampling-based motion planning method is proposed based on the Rapidly-exploring Random Tree (RRT) algorithm for continuum tubular robots in 3D environments, such as medullary cavities. The proposed motion planner enables a continuum tubular robot to maneuver roughly along the central axis of the statistical humerus atlas in an approximate follow-the-leader manner. The experiment results have demonstrated the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed motion planning algorithm.",

        "abstract": "This paper proposes a novel motion planning approach that exploits the concept of synergies (correlations) between degrees of freedom, extending it to the velocity space and calling them first-order synergies. An automatic partition method is defined to optimally divide the configuration space into cells where first-order synergies are significantly different. Using this partition, an algorithm that tends to grow a tree by extending the branches in the directions determined by the the first-order synergies of the cell where the leaf to be grown lies is introduced and called FOS-RRT. This allows the natural expansion of the tree along the directions determined by the data used to define the synergies. 2D examples illustrate the performance of the proposed approach, which is particularly attractive for potential applications in human-like robots using human synergies.",

Typical approaches generate evasive trajectories or optimise the trajectories of all involved vessels. The idea of this work is to validate these trajectories related to guaranteed motion safety, which means that it is not sufficient for a trajectory to be collision-free, but it must additionally ensure that an evasive manoeuvre is performable at any time. An approach using the distance and the evolution of the distance to the other vessels is proposed. The concept of Inevitable Collision States (ICS) is adopted to identify the states for which no evasive manoeuvre exist. Furthermore, it is implemented into a collision avoidance system for recreational crafts to demonstrate the performance.",

The approach enables online modeling of uncertain task costs and yields a schedule that adapts according to an evolving energy expenditure model. A fast heuristic method is formulated that enables online generation of a schedule that concurrently maximizes task completion frequency and avoids the risk of individual robot energy-depletion and consequential platform failure. Failure mitigation is introduced through a recourse strategy that routes robots based on acceptable levels of risk. Simulation and experimental results evaluate the efficacy of the proposed methodology and demonstrate online system-level adaptation due to increasingly certain costs models acquired during the deployment execution.",

        "abstract": "The present paper considers the modeling, control, development and experimental validation of bio-inspired multiarm underwater robotic swimmers actuated by compliant actuating elements, in the context of the soft robotics paradigm. Each one of the swimmer's compliant arms is actuated at its base by a pair of antagonistic compliant shape memory alloy (SMA) springs. The base joint of each such arm displays hysteretic behavior and asymmetries, which are compensated via the modified Prandtl-Ishlinskii (MPI) model of the joint's response, in conjunction with angular position feedback from a potentiometer. This closed-loop control scheme achieves fast and efficient tracking of a sculling joint motion profile. Experimental results based on a pair of such submerged arms, integrated in a catamaran hull, indicate the feasibility of this actuation and control scheme, providing propulsive speeds up to approximately 0.5 arm lengths per second (\u223c50 mm/sec) and propulsive forces up to 30 mN. The experimental studies presented, regarding the effect of the arm kinematic parameters on propulsive speed and force, are in qualitative agreement with previous results of our group for rigid-actuator multi-arm underwater swimmers.",

        "abstract": "This paper presents an innovative hand-held device able to compute stiffness when interacting with a soft object. The device is composed of four linear indenters and a USB camera. The stiffness is computed in real-time, tracking the movements of spherical features in the image of the camera. Those movements relate to the movements of the four indenters when interacting with a soft surface. Since the indenters are connected to springs with different spring constants, the displacement of the indenters varies when interacting with a soft object. The proposed multi-indenting device allows measuring the object's stiffness as well as the pan and tilt angles between the sensor and the surface of the soft object. Tests were performed to evaluate the accuracy of the proposed palpation mechanism against commercial springs of known stiffness. Results show that the accuracy and sensitivity of the proposed device increases with the softness of the examined object. Preliminary tests with silicon show the ability of the sensing mechanism to characterize phantom soft tissue for small indentation. It is noted that the results are not affected by the orientation of the device when probing the surface. The proposed sensing device can be used in different applications, such as external palpation for diagnosis or, if miniaturized, embedded on an endoscopic camera and used in Minimally Invasive Surgery (MIS).",

        "abstract": "Reliable manipulation of everyday household objects is essential to the success of service robots. In order to accurately manipulate these objects, robots need to know objects' full 6-DOF pose, which is challenging due to sensor noise, clutters and occlusions. In this paper, we present a new approach for effectively guessing the object pose given an observation of just a small patch of the object, by leveraging the fact that many household objects can only keep stable on a planar surface under a small set of poses. In particular, for each stable pose of an object, we slice the object with horizontal planes and extract multiple cross-section contours. The pose estimation is then reduced to find a stable pose whose contour matches best with that of the sensor data, and this can be solved efficiently by convolution. Experiments on the manipulation tasks in the DARPA Robotics Challenge validate our approach. In addition, we also investigate our method's performance on object recognition tasks raising in the challenge.",

Numerous types of microrobotic swimmers have been developed, assuming different peculiar applications, but often suffering from a lack of mobility and robustness, due to their unique propulsion mode. Hence we present in this paper the multi-flagella helical microswimmers that combine complementary propulsion modes for covering different motions and applications. The numerous possibilities of motions make the robots capable of moving rapidly, on long distances and in hard conditions, as expected in biological organisms. Besides, our microswimmers prove to be able of precise targeted binding, reversible binding, and multi-scale cargo transport moving particles from 5 to 30 \u00b5m large. Thus the demonstrated skillful multi-flagella helical microswimmers are very promising for future interventions in microfluidic chips and biological organisms, such as cell manipulation, precise drug delivery, minimally invasive surgery.",

In the present paper, we maintain all the advantages of the AKP, and we overcome the previous limitations by presenting novel contributions to our approach. Firstly, we present a multi-objective cost function to consider different and independent criteria and a well-posed procedure to build a joint cost function in order to select the best path. Then, we improve the construction of the planner tree by introducing a cost-to-go function that will be shown to outperform a classical Euclidean distance approach. In order to achieve real time calculations, we have used a steering heuristic that dramatically speeds up the process. Plenty of simulations and real experiments have been carried out to demonstrate the success of the AKP.",

        "abstract": "Teams of mobile robots can be deployed in search and rescue missions to explore previously unknown environments. Methods for joint localization and mapping constitute the basis for (semi-)autonomous cooperative action, in particular when navigating in GPS-denied areas. As communication losses may occur, a decentralized solution is required. With these challenges in mind, we designed a submap-based SLAM system that relies on inertial measurements and stereo-vision to create multi-robot dense 3D maps. For online pose and map estimation, we integrate the results of keyframe-based local reference filters through incremental graph SLAM. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to combine these two methods to benefit from their particular advantages for 6D multi-robot localization and mapping: Local reference filters on each robot provide real-time, long-term stable state estimates that are required for stabilization, control and fast obstacle avoidance, whereas online graph optimization provides global multi-robot pose and map estimates needed for cooperative planning. We propose a novel graph topology for a decoupled integration of local filter estimates from multiple robots into a SLAM graph according to the filters' uncertainty estimates and independence assumptions and evaluated its benefits on two different robots in indoor, outdoor and mixed scenarios. Further, we performed two extended experiments in a multi-robot setup to evaluate the full SLAM system, including visual robot detections and submap matches as inter-robot loop closure constraints.",

Here the human can be interpreted as a leader in a leader-follower formation with the robotic manipulators being the followers. The results of a controllability analysis in such a leader-follower formation suggest that it is beneficial to measure the state of the human (leader) by all physically cooperating manipulators (followers). The proposed approach is evaluated in a full-scale multi-robot cooperative manipulation experiment with humans.",

The method is local and computes the optimal parameters for the formation within a neighborhood of the robots, allowing for reconfigurations, when required, by considering a set of target formations. The method consists of first computing the largest collision-free convex polytope in a neighborhood of the robots, followed by a constrained optimization via sequential convex programming where the optimal parameters for the formation are obtained. The robots navigate towards the target collision-free formation with individual local planners that account for their dynamics.

Agents have a local view of their environment, inside which they navigate in a asynchronous manner. When the exploration is complete, agents gather at a rendezvous point. The novelty consists in using a distributed exploration algorithm which is not guided by frontiers to perform this task. Using the Brick&Mortar Improved ant-algorithm as a base, we add robot-perspective vision, variable vision range, and an optimization which prevents agents from going to the rendezvous point before exploration is complete. The algorithm was evaluated in simulation on a set of standard maps.",

        "abstract": "In this paper, we consider several autonomous robots with separate tasks that require coordination, but not a coupling at every decision step. We assume that each robot separately acquires its task, possibly from different providers. We address the problem of multiple robots incrementally acquiring tasks that require their sparse-coordination. To this end, we present an approach to provide tasks to multiple robots, represented as sequences, conditionals, and loops of sensing and actuation primitives. Our approach leverages principles from sparse-coordination to acquire and represent these joint-robot plans compactly. Specifically, each primitive has associated preconditions and effects, and robots can condition on the state of one another. Robots share their state externally using a common domain language. The complete sparse-coordination framework runs on several robots. We report on experiments carried out with a Baxter manipulator and a CoBot mobile service robot.",

        "abstract": "This paper presents a novel approach to modeling the dynamics of human movements with a grid-based representation. The model we propose, termed as Multi-scale Conditional Transition Map (MCTMap), is an inhomogeneous HMM process that describes transitions of human location state in spatial and temporal space. Unlike existing work, our method is able to capture both local correlations and long-term dependencies on faraway initiating events. This enables the learned model to incorporate more information and to generate an informative representation of human existence probabilities across the grid map and along the temporal axis for intelligent interaction of the robot, such as avoiding or meeting the human. Our model consists of two levels. For each grid cell, we formulate the local dynamics using a variant of the left-to-right HMM, and thus explicitly model the exiting direction from the current cell. The dependency of this process on the entry direction is captured by employing the Input-Output HMM (IOHMM). On the higher level, we introduce the place where the whole trajectory originated into the IOHMM framework forming a hierarchical input structure to capture long-term dependencies. The capabilities of our method are verified by experimental results from 10 hours of data collected in an office corridor environment.",

In this paper, we try to create a similar coordination between these modalities of communication in order to make the robot behave as naturally as possible. The proposed system uses a group of videos in order to elicit specific target emotions in a human user, upon which interactive narratives will start (i.e., interactive discussions between the participant and the robot around each video's content). During each interaction experiment, the humanoid expressive ALICE robot engages and generates an adapted multimodal behavior to the emotional content of the projected video using speech, head-arm metaphoric gestures, and/or facial expressions. The interactive speech of the robot is synthesized using Mary-TTS (text to speech toolkit), which is used - in parallel - to generate adapted head-arm gestures [1]. This synthesized multimodal robot behavior is evaluated by the interacting human at the end of each emotion-eliciting experiment. The obtained results validate the positive effect of the generated robot behavior multimodality on interaction.",

Our architecture is composed of two separate CNN processing streams - one for each modality - which are consecutively combined with a late fusion network. We focus on learning with imperfect sensor data, a typical problem in real-world robotics tasks. For accurate learning, we introduce a multi-stage training methodology and two crucial ingredients for handling depth data with CNNs. The first, an effective encoding of depth information for CNNs that enables learning without the need for large depth datasets. The second, a data augmentation scheme for robust learning with depth images by corrupting them with realistic noise patterns. We present state-of-the-art results on the RGB-D object dataset [15] and show recognition in challenging RGB-D real-world noisy settings.",

Our model combines the bottom-up saliency and depth-based segmentation with the top-down cues such as pointing and gaze to detect the objects of interest according to the user. For generation of the top-down saliency maps, we have introduced novel methods for object saliency, based on the pointing direction as well as the gaze direction. For gaze estimation, a hybrid model has been introduced which automatically selects keypoint-based matching or back-projection based on the textureness of the object model. The combination of different cues ensures reliable object detection and interaction independent of the relative position between the user, robot and objects. Extensive experiments show good detection results in different interaction scenarios as well as in challenging environmental conditions.",

In this paper, an approach is presented for estimating the dynamic pose and the internal (body) and external (ground contact) wrenches acting on the individual feet of a bipedal robot fusing haptic (compliant skin), inertial, and force/torque (F/T) measurements. Assuming rigid body dynamics on an individual foot, an Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) is used to combine ankle F/T sensor readings, contact forces computed from a compliant tactile array on the foot sole and accelerometer plus gyroscope measurements, thereby estimating both the state and the external wrenches affecting a foot through a method of state augmentation. Moreover, covariance estimation of the measurement noise was carried out for all sensors, in particular, for the skin, a bayesian-network-based regression method was chosen. The framework was implemented with the iCub humanoid robot under a toppling scenario; the estimated augmented foot state was then used to compute the Foot Rotation Indicator (FRI) trajectory as a validation through prediction of the onset of toppling and instability.",

Given an unstable initial state of the robot, our approach plans for the optimal sequence of contact points such that the initial momentum is dissipated with minimal impacts on the robot. Instead of switching among a collection of individual control strategies, we propose a general algorithm which plans for appropriate responses to a wide variety of falls, from a single step to recover a gentle nudge, to a rolling motion to break a high-speed fall. Our algorithm transforms the falling problem into a sequence of inverted pendulum problems and use dynamic programming to solve the optimization efficiently. The planning algorithm is validated in physics simulation and experimentally tested on a BioloidGP humanoid.",

In consequence, these schemes are not suited to impose smooth priorities or changing them during motion execution. A recently developed mixture of controller approach superpose torques from several control modules for motion generation and thereby enables to flexibly impose priorities for pursuing different goals in parallel. The main contribution of this paper is the development of a framework which allows for automatic derivation of suitable mixture coefficients which represent priorities. The functionality of the optimization framework is demonstrated for a virtual 3 DOF pendulum and the humanoid robot COMAN.",

One of the most practical methods which remove large debris, such as non-functioning satellite, is attaching a propulsion system for reentry. However, it exists difficulty to attach the system because non-cooperative satellites are expected to have no fixture specialized for grasping purpose. Furthermore, the dynamic parameters of the target need to be determined to realize stabilization when they are unknown. Accordingly, multipoint contact is introduced for stabilization of push-only control and estimate parameters. This paper describes the estimation method of the dynamic parameters using an unscented Kalman filter based on multipoint contact information and attitude stabilization using push-only (without pull operation) control based on feedback linearization and receding horizon with input constraints.",

        "abstract": "This paper presents a centralized algorithm for multi-scale observation of multiple moving targets using a team of Micro Aerial Vehicles (MAVs). The proposed algorithm is appropriate when MAVs can observe targets at different elevations with the objective of jointly maximizing duration and resolution of observation for each target. The MAVs share the workload using a greedy assignment of locations and targets to MAVs. The proposed algorithm uses a quad-tree data structure to model the movement decisions of MAVs as well as the variable qualities (resolutions) of observations. We consider cases where there is uncertainty in the target observations (i.e., measurement noise), the number of targets is larger than that of the MAVs and the combined field of views (FOVs) of the sensors cannot cover the whole search region. Simulation results confirm the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.",

        "abstract": "The problem of active perception with an autonomous robot is studied in this paper. It is proposed that the exploratory behavior of the robot be controlled using mutual information (MI) surfaces between the current map and a one-step look ahead measurements. MI surfaces highlight informative areas for exploration. A novel method for computing these surfaces is described. An approach that exploits structural dependencies of the environment and handles sparse sensor measurements to build a continuous model of the environment, that can then be used to generate MI surfaces is also proposed. A gradient field of occupancy probability distribution is regressed from sensor data as a Gaussian Process and provide frontier boundaries for further exploration. The continuous global frontier surface completely describes unexplored regions and, inherently, provides an automatic termination criterion for a desired sensitivity. The results from publicly available datasets confirm an average improvement of the proposed methodology over comparable standard and state-of-the-art exploratory methods available in the literature by more than 20% and 13% in travel distance and map entropy reduction rate, respectively.",

The algorithm relies on a least squares formulation of the alignment problem, that minimizes an error metric depending on these surface characteristics. We named the approach Normal Iterative Closest Point (NICP in short). Extensive experiments on publicly available benchmark data show that NICP outperforms other state-of-the-art approaches.",

        "abstract": "Navigation in complex and unknown environments is a major challenge for blind people. The most popular, conventional navigation aids such as white canes and guide dogs, however, provide limited assistance in such settings as they are constrained to interpret the local environment only. At the same time, they can hardly be combined with a walker required by elderly people with walking disabilities. Technologies developed in the field of robotics have the potential to assist blind people in complex navigation tasks as they can provide information about obstacles and reason on both global and local environment models. The contribution of this paper is a smart walker that enables blind users to safely navigate. It includes an innovative vibro-tactile user interface and a controller that takes into account human characteristics based on a user study. The walker has been designed to deal with the fact that humans can only sense and interpret a limited number of commands and have a delayed response. Our experiments validate our claim that the technique outlined in this paper guides a user to the desired goal in less time and with shorter traveled distance compared to a standard robotic controller.",

The RodBot, which was introduced in previous work, is able to perform noncontact manipulation of microscopic objects such as fragile crystals by trapping them in an induced vortex fluid flow. Here, we are concerned with navigating the RodBot autonomously in a liquid environment containing obstacles such as crystals. A literature review shows existing approaches to untethered microrobot control are limited and cluttered environments are often not considered. We demonstrate real-time tracking of the RodBot and surrounding obstacles, kinematic obstacle-free path planning, and nonholonomic path following. The system was evaluated in qualitative and quantitative experiments, shows satisfactory performance, and presents itself as a first step towards fully automated crystal harvesting.",

We focus on the ability to learn visual-motor relationships, which can work as a reusable memory in association of drawing motion from a picture image. Assuming that a humanoid robot can draw a shape on a pen tablet, the proposed model learns drawing sequences, which comprises drawing motion and drawn picture image frames. To learn raw pixel data without any given specific features, we utilized a deep neural network for compressing large dimensional picture images and a continuous time recurrent neural network for integration of motion and picture images. To confirm the ability of the proposed model, we performed an experiment for learning 15 sequences comprising three types of shapes. The model successfully learns all the sequences and can associate a drawing motion from a not trained picture image and a trained picture with similar success. We also show that the proposed model self-organizes its behavior according to types shapes.",

        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "Braitenberg vehicles are simple models of the motion of animal towards, or away from, a stimulus. They have been used to implement target reaching and avoidance behaviours in robotics, based, among others, on sound, light, distance, and pressure sensors. When the sensors are accurate enough - when they provide a high signal to noise ratio - variations on the readings can be neglected. Their behaviour, in these applications, can be explained using a non-linear deterministic dynamical system. For noisy sensors, or when the physical interaction between the robot and the measured variable is complex, a deterministic model is not good enough. Some examples include robots with cheap sensors, sensor prototypes, or settings where the interaction with the environment changes the measurements, like odour tracking - as the motion of the robot creates turbulences in the air. This paper presents the first analysis of the behaviour of Braitenberg vehicle 3a with noisy sensors. The mathematical equations of the evolution of the vehicle state probability are derived under white noise assumptions, and a bound for the vehicle state uncertainty is obtained assuming Gaussian probability distributions of the pose. These equations relate the morphological parameters of the vehicle, the noise variance and the function connecting the sensors to the actuators. The non-linear controller simulations illustrate the local validity of the model, and global simulations show how the vehicles converge.",

        "abstract": "In contact micromanipulation, the adhesive forces between manipulators and microobjects decrease the chances of achieving successful releases at the desired positions. We study a non-contact micromanipulation technique of microbeads (300 \u00b5m in average diameter) using clusters of paramagnetic microparticles (100 \u00b5m in average diameter). This non-contact micromanipulation is done using the hydrodynamic forces instead of the interaction forces in contact manipulation, and hence eliminates the adhesive forces that decrease the chances of achieving successful releases. Motion of the cluster of microparticles results in a pressure gradient (within the vicinity of the microbead in a fluid) that derives and steers the microbeads without contact. The microparticles are moved under the influence of controlled magnetic field gradient to push or pull the microbeads towards reference positions. We achieve non-contact manipulation via pushing and pulling at average speeds of 219 \u00b5m/s and 258 \u00b5m/s for the microbead, respectively (using cluster of 10 microparticles). The noncontact pushing and pulling localize the microbeads within the vicinity of reference positions with average steady-state errors of 177 \u00b5m and 100 \u00b5m, respectively. Moreover, we experimentally demonstrate non-contact microassembly of 3 microbeads into an L-shape at a task completion time of 25 seconds.",

For miniature robots with a size of a few centimeters, it is challenging to achieve similar capabilities due to their small sizes. To address this problem, we present a new vision based landing algorithm using a non-vector space control method, which formulates the system dynamics in the space of sets\u2014different from the traditional vector space with a linear structure. Using a stabilization controller in the non-vector space, we can control the landing posture of a small robot with an active tail. Preliminary experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach. The research presented in this paper, together with the idea of compressive feedback\u2014when only a compressed image is used for feedback\u2014can potentially achieve real time onboard vision based control for miniature robots.",

        "abstract": "This paper proposes a simple solution for stabilization of a nano-hexacopter carrying a manipulator arm in order to increase the type of missions achievable by these types of systems. The manipulator arm is attached to the lower part of the hexacopter. The motion of the arm induces a change of the center of mass of the whole body, which induces torques which can produce the loss of stability. The present work deals with the stabilization of the whole system - that is hexacopter and arm - by means of a set of nonlinear control laws. First, an attitude control, stabilizes the hexacopter to a desired attitude taking into account the movement of the arm. Then, a suitable virtual control and the translational dynamics allow the formulation of a nonlinear controller, which drives the aerial vehicle to a desired position. Both controls consist in saturation functions. Experimental results validate the proposed control strategy and compares the results when the motion of the arm is taken into account or not.",

The work focuses on the friction force modeling to describe the dynamics of a stick-slip actuator in a wide operating range needed in nano-robotics. Based on the theory of the single state elasto-plastic model and on an experimental analysis, necessary conditions on presiding modeling are highlighted. The conditions allow describing the dynamics of stick-slip type actuators for both scanning mode and stepping mode in the time and the frequency domains and for backward and forward directions of the motion. The proposed dynamic model opens new perspective for closed loop control of nano-robotic system.",

        "abstract": "We consider the problem of state-observation and control for a bi-tethered aerial system composed by a physical chain of two underactuated aerial robots, also called UAVs. The controlled outputs are the Cartesian position of the last robot and the internal forces along the links. We aim at a minimal use of sensors in order to retrieve the full state. For this goal we propose an output transformation method whose applicability implies the system observability. When this is the case we prove that it is possible to design a nonlinear state estimator based on the high gain- and Luenberger- observers that is able to retrieve the state from any dynamic condition. We also demonstrate how this estimator can be employed with a nonlinear controller for the Cartesian position and the link stresses while ensuring the stability in closed-loop. We show the validity of the method for sensorial configurations composed only by two accelerometers (no gyros) and just two encoders, or two accelerometers (no gyros) and just two inclinometers. A realistic simulative validation concludes the paper.",

A CVT is a transmission whose ratio can be continuously varied and an IVT is a transmission whose ratio can be continuously varied from positive to negative values. However, efficient use of such transmissions in walking applications requires changing the transmission ratio at a minimal energy cost, even at rest, i.e. when the input shaft is not rotating. This contribution proposes a novel CVT and IVT principle which can achieve such ratio variations at rest. The presented CVT is a modified planetary gear, whose planets are conical and mounted on inclined shafts, and whose ring is made of contiguous diabolo-shaped rollers. This configuration enables the control of the transmission ratio by adjusting the point of contact between the cones and rollers that comprise the ring. A traditional planetary gear system can be added to the CVT to form an IVT.",

        "abstract": "Environment recognition is an effective way for a mobile robot to move across rough terrain. In particular, this makes it possible to prevent a tiny mobile robot from getting stuck or turning over. Several studies have been conducted on environment recognition using a laser range finder or camera. However, almost all of these studies focused on obstacle detection or shape recognition, which cannot be used to recognize the surface condition such as slipperiness. The purpose of this work is to design a model for estimating the surface condition using a tiny mobile robot. We set slipperiness as one of the parameters for recognizing the surface condition, which is already used by terramechanics, along with two additional parameters, the hardness and unevenness. We find that a robot can roughly estimate the ground hardness by measuring the current peak of a motor and the unevenness from measuring the robot posture. By recognizing the surface condition, the robot can change the parameters of the controlling motor based on the ground characteristics. This new method for recognizing the surface condition is significant, not only because it fills gaps in the previous research, but also because it does not require any special sensors such as a laser range finder and does not consume a large quantity of energy. Therefore, it achieves a core objective of our environmental monitoring system using multiple mobile robot.",

        "abstract": "Any system that realizes the function of autonomous driving has to perform the task of constructing a continuous trajectory that can be followed by the autonomous vehicle. Many planning approaches may benefit from an efficient algorithm that is able to construct a continuous trajectory which satisfies the initial and target poses of the vehicle as well as the vehicle actuator states at the boundaries. We present an approach to planning motion trajectories that solves this problem. Our method uses a steering profile which is inspired by human driving behavior. Careful parametrization of the steering profile allows designing of an efficient numerical solver to compute the values of the profile parameters for a wide range of possible vehicle target states. In addition, the comprehensible interpretation of the profile parameters may be exploited by planners that rely on trajectory sampling with varying boundary conditions at the trajectory end point.",

        "abstract": "Mapping the environment is crucial to enable path planning and obstacle avoidance for self-driving vehicles and other robots. In this paper, we concentrate on ground-based vehicles and present an approach which extracts static obstacles from depth maps computed out of multiple consecutive images. In contrast to existing approaches, our system does not require accurate visual inertial odometry estimation but solely relies on the readily available wheel odometry. To handle the resulting higher pose uncertainty, our system fuses obstacle detections over time and between cameras to estimate the free and occupied space around the vehicle. Using monocular fisheye cameras, we are able to cover a wider field of view and detect obstacles closer to the car, which are often not within the standard field of view of a classical binocular stereo camera setup. Our quantitative analysis shows that our system is accurate enough for navigation purposes of self-driving cars and runs in real-time.",

        "abstract": "Large debris created after natural disasters restrict access to inner parts of affected regions and slows down disaster relief operations. Power shovels are often used to clear wreckage but the process can take a lot of time. Moreover, it is dangerous to involve human workers in such conditions due to loose debris collapsing and causing severe damage. To speedup access to inner areas, instead of removing obstacles, they can be surmounted with the assistance of a carefully maneuvered power shovel arm. In this paper, an autonomous obstacle surmounting technique for an unmanned power shovel is proposed. Out of different sequences, the one that optimizes the total energy consumption is selected as the best candidate for surmounting a given obstacle by dynamic simulations. The experiments conducted using a miniaturized power shovel show the effectiveness of the proposed method.",

        "abstract": "In this paper the developed method for off-line compensation of tool deflections when milling aluminum with an industrial robot is presented. The efficiency of this approach is verified with high precision measurements of deflections using a laser tracker. The compensation method includes both the static milling process model which can predict the mean value components of the tool forces and a new combined local/global approach for estimating the combined stiffnesses of joints. With a process model such as the one presented in this paper and estimates of the robot's joint stiffness values, the tool path can be adjusted to counteract deflections of the tool during milling operations. The model was estimated from a large set of machining experiments and is valid for a given tool and material. The stiffness of each joint is a combination of several effects: (i) stiffness of the links, (ii) stiffness of joint bearings and gears and (iii) stiffness of the position control loops given by the individual axis controller gains in the controller software. The method presented in this paper increases accuracy when using an industrial robot for milling in relatively hard materials.",

        "abstract": "For autonomous navigation of Micro Aerial Vehicles (MAVs) in cluttered environments, it is essential to detect potential obstacles not only in the direction of flight but in their entire local environment. While there exist systems that do vision based obstacle detection, most of them are limited to a single perception direction. Extending these systems to a multi-directional sensing approach would exhaust the payload limit in terms of weight and computational power. We present a novel light-weight sensor setup comprising of four stereo heads and an inertial measurement unit (IMU) to perform FPGA-based dense reconstruction for obstacle detection in all directions. As the data-rate scales up with the number of cameras we use an FPGA to perform streaming based tasks in real-time and show a light-weight polar-coordinate map to allow a companion computer to fully process the data of all the cameras and perform obstacle detection in real-time. The system is able to process up to 80 frames per second (fps) freely distributed on the four stereo heads while maintaining a low power budget. The perception system including FPGA, image sensors and stereo mounts is 235 g in weight.",

Such mixed-initiative methods in goal-oriented commanding are new for the oceanographic domain and we describe the motivations and preliminary experiments with multiple vehicles operating simultaneously in the water, using a shore-based automated planner.",

        "abstract": "The modeling and control of a vectoring tricopter UAV are developed in this article. The UAV is actuated by three thrust motors, each guided by suitable actuators, thus forming a platform able to independently track any desired attitude and trajectory. The derivation of the equations of motion is followed by the development of a vectoring controller that is supplemented by an allocation strategy. Both are based on geometric feedback linearization techniques, resulting in a singularity-free control law, taking into account the inertia effects of the main body, of the motors, and of the vectoring dynamics (actuators). A stability proof is developed validating the effectiveness of the control strategy under bounded disturbances. Simulations showcase the developed controller and tricopter performance.",

        "abstract": "This paper presents a new control scheme for dexterous manipulation of an object by a multifingered hand. The aim of this control is to ensure the tracking by the object of specific trajectories depending on the task. More specifically, we consider a decoupling control according to the motion directions in the task space. The control scheme is based on a new eigenstructure assignment method, where the placement of the closed-loop eigenvalues ensures the stability of the system hand/object, and the strict placement of the object-level eigenvectors ensures the system decoupling. A parallel is made between task specifications and synergies. Current synergy controllers are often bio-inspired and based on the analysis of synergies in the human hand. The proposed algorithm allows the specification of precise object level performance according to the task, and to find the related synergies. Moreover, robustness to uncertainties on the contact point is an additional objective of the control law, and the effect of these uncertainties on the decoupling is investigated. Simulation results are presented and illustrate the decoupling effect of the control law on the system hand/object in the 2D-cartesian space.",

We address the DTSPN as a problem to find Dubins path to visit a given sequence of regions and propose a simple iterative optimization procedure to find Dubins path visiting the regions. The proposed approach allows to efficiently solve the DTSPN and based on the presented comparison with existing approaches, the proposed algorithm provides solutions of competitive quality to the evolutionary techniques while it is significantly less computationally demanding.",

        "abstract": "This paper investigates the ability of dynamically walking bipeds to adapt their motion to persistent exogenous forcing. Applications that involve physical interactions between a bipedal robot and other robots (or humans), require that the robot adjust its stepping pattern in response to externally applied force signals. In our setting, an underactuated bipedal robot model walks under the influence of an external force. First, the hybrid zero dynamics method is used to design controllers that stabilize periodic walking motions in the absence of the external force. Then, conditions are derived analytically under which these (unforced) periodic gaits are modified to new (possibly aperiodic) stepping patterns that are consistent with the external force. It is deduced that underactuation holds the key to the ability of our model to adapt to external forces.",

        "abstract": "This paper examines the problem of transitioning between gaits using a sagittal-plane reduced-order model of quadrupedal running, which has compliant elements in its torso and legs. First, periodic motions that correspond to pronking and two variations of bounding are generated. Analysis of the torso pitch motion in these gaits reveals basic differences that determine whether transitions between these gaits can be achieved. This observation is then incorporated in control design to enhance the stability of the generated motions. The domain of attraction of the closed-loop systems is estimated through simulation, showing that transition between pronking and bounding can be realized as a sequence of switchings between fixed points. The results in this work can be regarded as the first step towards synthesizing controllers for gait transitions within template models for quadrupedal running gaits.",

It is well known that the forward kinematics of parallel robots may have multiple solutions and in general the convergence of numerical methods is unknown. In recent works, it was proposed to formulate the forward kinematics as optimization problem that models the cables as linear springs in order to compute the platform pose which has minimal potential energy in the cables. In this paper, we analyzed this objective function. Using the Hessian matrix, we show that under certain conditions the problem at hand is convex and we can expect a unique and stable minimum. The computations are exemplified for point-shaped platforms as well as for the planar case. For the spatial case, we present an encouraging numerical study. An ordinary least squares method is then applied to find a position approximation and an improvement to previous methods is demonstrated.",

We show that the IK requires to solve a square system of equations if the robot has up to 6 cables and an underconstrained system if the number of cables is larger than 6. In this paper we address the problem of finding all solutions of the IK when the number of cables is lower or equal to 6. We propose an algorithm that allows one to determine all possible solutions. for any number of cables. We illustrate the use of the IK solver on a CDPR with 6 cables and shows that the IK may have no solution even if the pose lie within the envelope of the base points or may have several solutions, in which case some cables may have a length at rest that is much larger than the distance between the anchor points of the cable.",

Our approach to explore the need for a coordination mechanism is based on a systematic methodology to identify team coordination requirements. We show that a team combined of robots that each individually can solve a task not always is able to guarantee task completion as a team. In these cases some mechanism for coordination is required and we formally identify various problem classes that impose different requirements. We introduce a formal task model and distinguish between no, implicit and explicit coordination mechanisms. This model is used to study which mechanisms guarantee task completion. It allows us to prove some empirical findings reported in the literature such as that a simple foraging task does not require coordination.",

Our goal is to characterize all teleoperation system behaviors that can be achieved with delayed communication but without any restrictive assumptions on the control law, such as passivity. To this end, a recent non-restrictive stabilizing control architecture for bilateral teleoperation is exploited. The main properties of this architecture are discussed and used to obtain parameterization of all the admittance matrices feasible under the nominal stability constraint. The use of this parameterization for shaping system behavior is demonstrated and the results are compared with those obtained using the classical passivity-based control schemes.",

        "abstract": "After the incredible success of deep learning in the computer vision domain, there has been much interest in applying Convolutional Network (ConvNet) features in robotic fields such as visual navigation and SLAM. Unfortunately, there are fundamental differences and challenges involved. Computer vision datasets are very different in character to robotic camera data, real-time performance is essential, and performance priorities can be different. This paper comprehensively evaluates and compares the utility of three state-of-the-art ConvNets on the problems of particular relevance to navigation for robots; viewpoint-invariance and condition-invariance, and for the first time enables real-time place recognition performance using ConvNets with large maps by integrating a variety of existing (locality-sensitive hashing) and novel (semantic search space partitioning) optimization techniques. We present extensive experiments on four real world datasets cultivated to evaluate each of the specific challenges in place recognition. The results demonstrate that speed-ups of two orders of magnitude can be achieved with minimal accuracy degradation, enabling real-time performance. We confirm that networks trained for semantic place categorization also perform better at (specific) place recognition when faced with severe appearance changes and provide a reference for which networks and layers are optimal for different aspects of the place recognition problem.",

Statistical techniques that employ probabilistic graphical models have proven effective at interpreting symbols that represent commands and observations for robot direction-following and object manipulation. A limitation of these approaches is their inefficiency in dealing with larger and more complex symbolic representations. Herein, we present a model for language understanding that uses parse trees and environment models both to learn the structure of probabilistic graphical models and to perform inference over this learned structure for symbol grounding. This model, called the Hierarchical Distributed Correspondence Graph (HDCG), exploits information about symbols that are expressed in the corpus to construct minimalist graphical models that are more efficient to search. In a series of comparative experiments, we demonstrate a significant improvement in efficiency without loss in accuracy over contemporary approaches for human-robot interaction.",

By applying circular vibration to a chip having micropillar patterns on its surface, local whirling flow is induced around the micropillars. Therefore, by patterning micropillar array on a chip and applying the circular vibration to the chip, we can achieve cell transportation along the array in an open chip environment. We theoretically analyzed this phenomenon with a single micropillar, and experimentally evaluated behaviours of manipulated microbeads with two micropillars. We confirm there are different manipulation modes according to the pitch of micropillars. We designed the micropillar array for an oocyte transportation based on these evaluations. We succeeded in the transportation of oocytes with up to 35.6 \u03bcm/s and confirmed that the velocity can be changed by changing the frequency and amplitude of the applied vibration.",

        "abstract": "Concentric tube robots are catheter-sized robots that are ideally suited for navigating along natural anatomical pathways and treating deep-seated pathologies. Their telemanipulation in dynamic environments requires on-line computation of inverse kinematics with simultaneous avoidance of anatomical obstacles. Moreover, unstable configurations, which arise for elongated curved robots that navigate extremely tortuous paths, must be avoided. To achieve on-line computations, existing work has investigated Jacobian approximations and configuration-space precomputation. This paper leverages the state-of-the-art multi-core computer architectures to deliver real-time local inverse kinematics solutions using the established concentric tube robot mechanics models while avoiding both instabilities and anatomical collisions. Furthermore, it considers frictional active constraints for concentric tube robots, i.e. viscoelastic force fields that guide the operator away from obstacles and towards safe configurations. The value of the proposed framework is demonstrated on realistic clinical scenarios.",

The control system adjusts the stride length and walking velocity of a robot according to user's voluntary movement while generating a continuous walking pattern. We assume that the desired stride length and walking speed correspond to the preceding motion of a walking aid (walker), and the motion of the walker by the user was measured by a laser range sensor and an accelerometer. The continuous walking pattern during a step was planned by optimization of joint trajectories under inequality conditions. To perform continuous walking, the desired trajectory is required before the walker movement. To adjust the foot placement according to the walker movement, the desired walking pattern in the late swing phase is replanned. For the latest movement distance of the walker, the posture at heel strike is modified by Newton-like iterative calculations. We confirmed that a normal subject could walk continuously with a wearable robot controlled by our system while changing the stride length and walking speed.",

        "abstract": "In this paper, we propose a novel online gait task recognition algorithm for hip exoskeleton. The proposed algorithm provides an automatic and prompt recognition result in just one step based on the relations between both hip joint angles at the moment of foot contact. Gait task recognition is one of the challenges that walking assist devices must address to offer adaptable and reliable assistance to users. However gait task recognition in hip exoskeleton is challenging because the sensors are very limited and fast gait task recognition is required to prevent inadequate assistance and reduce fall risk. Although in general foot contact event can be considered as crucial information during walking, it has not received attention in hip exoskeletons with no sensors corresponding foot force or pressure. In this study, we exploit foot contact event as a critical point to perform gait task recognition in hip exoskeleton. The proposed algorithm suggests a foot contact estimation method without using any foot force or pressure sensors and a rule-based inference system to recognize a new gait task in real time. Results presented from experiments will demonstrate the validity and performance of the proposed algorithm.",

This paper addresses the problem of multiagent learning in the likely scenario that agents estimate different models from their measured data, but they can share information by communicating model parameters. Previous approaches either consider homogeneous scenarios or perform model transfer in an open-loop manner, which hinders the convergence rate. We develop a closed-loop multiagent learning algorithm, Collaborative Filtering-Decentralized Incremental Feature Dependency Discovery (CF-Dec-iFDD), which enables agents to learn and share models in heterogeneous scenarios. Each agent learns a linear function approximation of the actual model, and the number of features is increased incrementally to adjust model complexity based on the observed data. The agents obtain feedback from other agents on the model error reduction associated with the communicated features. Although this increases the communication cost of exchanging features, it improves the quality/utility of what is being exchanged, leading to improved convergence rate. The approach is demonstrated in indoor hardware flight tests on a forest fire management scenario for which agents must learn the transition model of the fire spread depending on external factors such as wind and vegetation. It is shown that CF-Dec-iFDD has superior convergence rate compared to the alternative approaches.",

        "abstract": "Temporal logics have proven effective for correct-by-construction synthesis of controllers for a wide range of robotic applications. Receding horizon frameworks mitigate the computational intractability of reactive synthesis for temporal logic, but have thus far been limited by pursuing a single sequence of short horizon problems to the goal. We propose a receding horizon algorithm for reactive synthesis that automatically determines a path to the currently pursued goal at runtime, responding as needed to nondeterministic environment behavior. This is achieved by allowing each short horizon to have multiple local goals, and determining which local goal to pursue based on the current global goal, the currently perceived environment and a pre-computed invariant dependent on the global goal. We demonstrate the utility of this additional flexibility in grant-response tasks, using a search-and-rescue example. Moreover, we show that these goal-dependent invariants mitigate the conservativeness of the receding horizon approach.",

Implicit in all localization and place recognition techniques is the ability to decide whether a place is novel or familiar; the idea of \u201chas this place been visited before?\u201d. To make this decision accurately, localization systems typically require prior calibration or training on datasets from the specific type of operating environment; a requirement that is not practical in many environments or applications. One approach to this problem has been to remove the perfect data association requirement for place recognition systems by utilizing robust pose graphs. However, this approach requires a batch-based process and consequently does not solve the problem of real-time navigation in the interim before optimization. We present a novel technique which calibrates the localization system online as the robot moves through an environment, alleviating the need for prior calibration of a localization system. We leverage a robust pose graph optimization to determine a suitable model for our place recognition system which is sensor-invariant and does not require manually-labeled data for threshold tuning. The system continually refines place recognition parameters using sensory data and an optimized pose graph in order to increase the instantaneous precision of the location matches output by the underlying robust pose graph. We evaluate the system using the public New College dataset and a multi-sensor indoor office dataset. Our results indicate that the system produces superior mapping performance to a static place recognition model, and superior instantaneous place recognition performance to a robust pose graph technique.",

Inclusion of step time modification extends the robustness against rarely addressed disturbances, such as pushes towards the stance foot. The controller is able to recover dynamic stability regardless of the source of the disturbance (e.g. model inaccuracy, reference tracking error or external disturbance). We describe the robot state estimation and center-of-mass feedback controller necessary to realize stable locomotion on our humanoid platform COMAN. We also present a set of experiments performed on the platform that show the performance of the feedback controller and of the gait pattern regenerator.

In a recently introduced version of the problem, adversarial coverage, the covering robot operates in an environment that contains threats that might stop it. Previous studies of this problem dealt with finding optimal strategies for the coverage, that minimize both the coverage time and the probability that the robot will be stopped before completing the coverage. However, these studies assumed that a map of the environment, which includes the specific locations of the threats, is given to the robot in advance. In this paper, we deal with the online version of the problem, in which the covering robot has no a-priori knowledge of the environment, and thus has to use real-time sensor measurements in order to detect the threats. We employ a frontier-based coverage strategy that determines the best frontier to be visited by taking into account both the cost of moving to the frontier and the safety of the region that is reachable from it. We also examine the effect of the robot's sensing capabilities on the expected coverage percentage. Finally, we compare the performance of the online algorithm to its offline counterparts under various environmental conditions.",

        "abstract": "We address the problem of verifying motion plans for aerial robots in uncertain and partially-known environments. Thereby, the initial state of the robot is uncertain due to errors from the state estimation and the motion is uncertain due to wind disturbances and control errors caused by sensor noise. Since the environment is perceived at runtime, the verification of partial motion plans must be performed online (i.e. during operation) to ensure safety within the planning horizon and beyond. This is achieved by efficiently generating robust control invariant sets based on so-called loiter circles, where the position of the aerial robot follows a circular pattern. Verification of aerial robots is challenging due to the nonlinearity of their dynamics, the high dimensionality of their state space, and their potentially high velocities. We use novel techniques from reachability analysis to overcome those challenges. In order to ensure that the robot never finds itself in a situation for which no safe maneuver exists, we provide a technique that ensures safety of aerial robots beyond the planning horizon. Our method is applicable to all kinds of robotic systems that follow reference trajectories, such as bipedal robotic walking, robotic manipulators, automated vehicles, and the like. We evaluate our method by simulations of high speed helicopter flights.",

This paper introduces the planner CHIMP, which is based on meta-CSP planning to represent the hybrid plan space and uses hierarchical planning as the strategy for cutting efficiently through this space. The paper makes two contributions: First, it describes how HTN planning is integrated into meta-CSP reasoning leading to a planner that can reason about different forms of knowledge and that is fast enough to be used on a robot. Second, it demonstrates CHIMP's task merging capabilities, i.e., the unification of different tasks from different plan parts, resulting in plans that are more efficient to execute. It also allows to merge new tasks online into a plan that is being executed. This is demonstrated on a PR2 robot.",

The differential mechanism used is a variation of the whiffletree (or seesaw) mechanism, which introduces a set of locking buttons that can block the motion of each finger. The proposed design is unique since with a single motor and the proposed differential mechanism the user is able to control each finger independently and switch between different grasping postures in an intuitive manner. Anthropomorphism of robot structure and motion is achieved by employing in the design process an index of anthropomorphism. The proposed robot hands can be easily fabricated using low-cost, off-the-shelf materials and rapid prototyping techniques. The efficacy of the proposed design is validated through different experimental paradigms involving grasping of everyday life objects and execution of daily life activities. The proposed hands can be used as affordable prostheses, helping amputees regain their lost dexterity.",

        "abstract": "The Rubber Hand Illusion is a well known multisensory illusion in which the participant feels their own unseen hand become a rubber hand that is placed at the position where their hand is supposedly placed, triggered by synchronized haptic stimuli on their hand and the rubber hand. Our previous study showed that a robotized 1-degree-of-freedom rubber hand in the form of a master-slave system significantly enhanced the illusion compared with the classic rubber hand illusion. The illusion gives the sense that the part of body becomes part of the robot - it is thus assumed that this multisensory illusion is a potentially effective way to increase intuitiveness, and therefore increase the operability of a multi-degrees-of-freedom master-slave system. To further investigate the concept, we built a multisensory illusion inducible microsurgical robotic system based on the findings of the previous study and conducted a series of psychophysical experiments. The experimental results reveal that the multisensory illusion and operability is significantly correlated.",

        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "We introduce a novel setup of self-supervised learning (SSL), in which optical flow provides the supervised outputs. Optical flow requires significant movement for obstacle detection. The main advantage of the introduced method is that after learning, a robot can detect obstacles without moving - reducing the risk of collisions in narrow spaces. We investigate this novel setup of SSL in the context of a Micro Air Vehicle (MAV) that needs to select a suitable landing place. Initially, when the MAV flies over a potential landing area, the optical flow processing estimates a \u2018surface roughness\u2019 measure, capturing whether there are obstacles sticking out of the landing surface. This measure allows the MAV to select a safe landing place and then land with other optical flow measures such as the divergence. During flight, SSL takes place. For each image a texton distribution is extracted (capturing the visual appearance of the landing surface in sight), and mapped to the current roughness value by a linear regression function. We first demonstrate this principle to work with offline tests involving images captured on board an MAV, and then demonstrate the principle in flight. The experiments show that the MAV can land safely on the basis of optical flow. After learning it can also successfully select safe landing spots in hover. It is even shown that the appearance learning allows the pixel-wise segmentation of obstacles.",

The algorithm, termed Ergodic Environmental Exploration (E3), is a finite receding horizon optimal control algorithm that minimizes control effort and the difference between the time average behavior of the system's trajectory and the distribution of the gain in information. The novelty of the E3 algorithm is the gain in information distribution used in the exploration trajectory optimization. The gain in information distribution uses an estimate of the information distribution and the confidence value on that estimate. Successful experiments have been conducted using E3 on a real mobile robot to explore an unknown 2-dimensional area.

A novel systematic optimization-based approach is presented for making important design choices, such as the selection of gearboxes and electric DC motors in the drive-train, manipulator link lengths, and UGV base length. The objective is to minimize the overall mass of the MM-UGV. Constraints related to workspace, dynamic tip-over stability, actuator torque/force limits in static and dynamic motions, executed in the air or on the ground, and battery properties are incorporated into the problem formulation. The system operating conditions in the form of the range of end-effector forces, operating surface grade, and various position, velocity and acceleration variables are provided by the designer. The resulting problem is a robust bilevel nonlinear optimization, in which some of the constraints are derived from maximization/minimization over the operational variables to ensure constraint satisfaction in all possible operation scenarios. The problem is solved using a genetic algorithm. Numerical simulations demonstrate that the proposed strategy produces a design that meets the user-specified requirements.",

Applications of a database of high-quality colored meshes include object recognition in robot vision, virtual reality, graphics, and online shopping. Most modern approaches that color a 3D object model from a collection of RGB images face problems in (1) producing realistic colors for non-Lambertian surfaces and (2) seamlessly integrating colors from multiple views. Our approach efficiently solves a non-linear least squares optimization problem to jointly estimate the RGB camera poses and color model. We discover that incorporating 2D texture cues, vertex color smoothing, and texture-adaptive camera viewpoint selection into the optimization problem produces qualitatively more coherent color models than those produced by competing methods. We further introduce practical strategies to accelerate optimization. We provide extensive empirical results on the BigBIRD dataset [15], [21]: results from a user study with 133 participants indicate that on all 16 objects considered, our method outperforms competing approaches.

The component tubes of these robots can be swapped prior to performing a task in order to customize the robot's behavior and reachable workspace. Optimizing a robot's design by appropriately selecting tube parameters can improve the robot's effectiveness on a procedure- and patient-specific basis. In this paper, we present an algorithm that generates sets of concentric tube robot designs that can collectively maximize the reachable percentage of a given goal region in the human body. Our algorithm combines a search in the design space of a concentric tube robot using a global optimization method with a sampling-based motion planner in the robot's configuration space in order to find sets of designs that enable motions to goal regions while avoiding contact with anatomical obstacles. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our algorithm in a simulated scenario based on lung anatomy.",

        "abstract": "This paper presents a novel active audition method that enables multiple mobile robots to move to optimal positions for improving the performance of sound source separation. A main advantage of our distributed system is that each robot has its own microphone array and all mobile robots can collaborate on source separation by regarding a set of movable microphone arrays as a big reconfigurable array. To incrementally optimize the positions of the robots (the layout of the big microphone array) in an active-audition manner, it is necessary to predict the source separation performance from a possible layout of the next time step although true source signals are unknown. To solve this problem, our method simulates delay-and-sum beamforming from a possible layout for theoretically calculating the gain for each frequency component of a source signal in the corresponding separated signal. The robots are moved into a layout with the highest average gain over all sources and the whole frequency range. The experimental results showed that the harmonic mean of signal-to-distortion ratios (SDRs) was improved by 6.0 dB in simulations and by 5.7 dB in a real environment.",

        "abstract": "Mobile humanoid robots have the capability of accomplishing complex tasks in human dominated environments. In order to execute a task with its arm, a robot needs to place its base reasonably first. In previous work, a positionbased reachability map solved this problem by matching a precomputed inverse kinematics database with discretized versions of the task path. However, its capability is restricted to the end effector with which the database was computed. This paper proposes an orientation-based reachability map which supports on-line end effector frame extensions. The added extension capability enables robots to handle partially constrained task paths with different tool frames, which would be non-trivial for previous methods without recomputing a reachability map. We discuss the differences between the new method and its predecessors, and analyze extension transformation matrix to provide mathematical proof for the extension capability of our reachability map. Our experimental results show that the orientation-based reachability map is as fast as the positionbased reachability map while benefiting from the additional extension capability.",

        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "Efficient object manipulation based only on force feedback typically requires a plan of actively contact-seeking actions to reduce uncertainty over the true environmental model. In principle, that problem could be formulated as a full partially observable Markov decision process (POMDP) whose observations are sensed forces indicating the presence/absence of contacts with objects. Such a naive application leads to a very large POMDP with high-dimensional continuous state, action and observation spaces. Solving such large POMDPs is practically prohibitive. In other words, we are facing three challenging problems: 1) uncertainty over discontinuous contacts with objects; 2) high-dimensional continuous spaces; 3) optimization for not only trajectory cost but also execution time. As trajectory optimization is a powerful model-based method for motion generation, it can handle the last two issues effectively by computing locally optimal trajectories. This paper aims to integrate advantages of trajectory optimization into existing POMDP solvers. The full POMDP formulation is solved using sample-based approaches, where each sampled model is quickly evaluated via trajectory optimization instead of simulating a large number of rollouts. To further accelerate the solver, we propose to integrate temporal abstraction, i.e. macro actions or temporal actions, into the POMDP model. We demonstrate the proposed method on a simulated 7 DoF KUKA arm and a physical Willow Garage PR2 platform. The results show that our proposed method could effectively seek contacts in complex scenarios, and achieve near-optimal performance of path planing.",

        "abstract": "Disaster response is one of the most critical social issues and introduces quite a few research themes for the AI planning area. Robocup Rescue provides a platform to simulate the rescue process in a city when an earthquake happens. Existing methods consist of multi-agent methods that use greedy heuristics. These methods scale to large maps but suffer from volatile performance under different scenarios. In this work, we propose a planning framework to boost the performance on Robocup Rescue given several policies from the competition to be used as components. More specifically, we use an online POMDP algorithm with macro-actions and restrict it to plan within the space of tasks performed by the agents in the component policies at each time instance. Since the action space contains macro-actions of the component policies, the method is guaranteed to perform at least as well as the best component policy, and possibly better, if sufficient computation is provided. On the other hand, the restriction of the tasks to those suggested by component policies reduces the computational complexity of planning and allows the planning method to be practically applied. Experiment results show that our planner generates better performance than the best component policy for some scenarios and gives performance comparable to the best component policy for the rest.",

However, most existing algorithms for reference resolution are domain-specific and limited to environments assumed to be known a priori. In this paper we present an algorithm for reference resolution which is both domain independent and designed to operate in an open world. We call this algorithm POWER: Probabilistic Open-World Entity Resolution.

Lighting changes, self-similar textures, motion blur, and moving objects are all considerable stumbling blocks for state-of-the-art vision-based navigation algorithms. In this paper we present a novel technique for improving localization accuracy within a visual-inertial navigation system (VINS). We make use of training data to learn a model for the quality of visual features with respect to localization error in a given environment. This model maps each visual observation from a predefined prediction space of visual-inertial predictors onto a scalar weight, which is then used to scale the observation covariance matrix. In this way, our model can adjust the influence of each observation according to its quality. We discuss our choice of predictors and report substantial reductions in localization error on 4 km of data from the KITTI dataset, as well as on experimental datasets consisting of 700 m of indoor and outdoor driving on a small ground rover equipped with a Skybotix VI-Sensor.",

To this end, we propose an alternating optimization procedure that estimates lower body orientations and detects groups of interacting people. The first task is achieved by tracking the direction of the lower body of the people in the scene based on their position, their head orientation, the location of objects of interest in their vicinity, and their groups. For the second task, we propose a new group detection algorithm based on F-formation detection. This method can reason about lower body orientation distributions, and generates soft group assignments for the orientation trackers. We evaluate the proposed approach on a publicly available dataset, and show that it can improve state-of-the-art detection of non-interacting people without sacrificing group detection accuracy. This is particularly useful for robots since it provides more opportunities for starting interactions and can help estimate disengagement.",

        "abstract": "For satellite servicing, it is necessary to remove a patch of multi-layer insulation (MLI) that covers the access panel. We consider the case where this patch is secured by tape and desire to use ground-based teleoperation to carefully cut the tape on three sides of the patch. Communication delays of several seconds motivate the development of an online method to enable failure detection by the remote (on-orbit) robot system, so that cutting can be stopped without having to wait several seconds for the ground-based operator to observe the failure. This method is based on a model that predicts the force in the direction of cutting. The model parameters are provided by a recursive least squares estimator, with vector-like forgetting factors, that also includes a throttling mechanism to ensure that the estimator is used only when operating conditions and measurements enable reasonable outcomes. During cutting, the predicted force is compared to the measured force to detect various types of failures. Experiments are conducted on a ground-based platform to demonstrate that the proposed estimation system can reliably detect these failures.",

In this paper, we discuss the robot-world, hand-eye calibration problem which has been modeled as the linear relationship AX = ZB, where X and Z are the unknown calibration matrices composed of rotation and translation components. While there are many different approaches to determining X and Z, including linear and iterative methods, we parameterize the rotation components using Euler angles and find a solution using Levenberg-Marquadt iterative approach. We also offer a method to determine A, X, and Z, by formulating the robot-world, hand-eye calibration problem in terms of camera reprojection error. We compare both of these approaches to the state-of-the-art and conclude that our approaches yield lower values of camera reprojection error. In addition, we demonstrate the improved reconstruction accuracy when using the robot-world, hand-eye calibrations produced from our methods.",

We present an efficient parametric covariance predictor based on the modified Cholesky decomposition that maps from features of the input to covariance matrices. In addition, we discuss fitting the predictor parameters using noise samples with simple regularization techniques. We demonstrate our approach by estimating observation covariances for range-bearing localization with simulated and experimental datasets and show that this results in increased filtering performance compared to traditional covariance adaptation and constant covariance baselines.",

        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "This paper explores the use of a single passive design to stabilize frontal plane dynamics for 3D biped walking across a range of forward velocities and/or step lengths. Particular goals are to determine if design of sagittal plane control can be done independently from design of frontal plane stabilization mechanisms, and to explore how dynamic coupling between the two planned motions affects energetic efficiency of walking. Passive dynamic walkers have long utilized curved feet for low energy frontal plane stabilization in 3D walking, with the current design practice of matching the linearized resonance of the curvature to match a particular, steady-state walking gait to achieve stable coupled limit cycle in 3D dynamics. However, practical legged walking systems should operate across a range of velocities and step widths. We examine aspects of the nonlinear dynamics that contribute to the energy efficiency and stability of the system through simulations. Specifically, we focus on the tight coupling between the frontal plane dynamics and stepping speed. We find that roll velocity is strongly coupled to the stepping speed and energy consumption. Our decoupled analysis explains some aspects of the 3D motions; however, the actual effects on cost of transport demonstrate interesting phenomena we had not anticipated. Specifically, while a general trend of increasing cost of transport for 3D vs 2D gaits with stride time does hold in our simulations, the 3D gaits sometimes require less energy than their constrained 2D counterparts, which was a surprising and encouraging result. This work provides a promising direction for the development of practical methods to utilize control designed for planar 2D walking models on more sophisticated 3D dynamic models using little or no additional active control.",

In this paper, referring to the upper body of a human, we propose a trunk mechanism that has redundant and viscoelastic joints and changes their viscoelasticity with relatively low energy consumption. By using physical and simulation models, we observe the relationship between the viscoelasticity of the trunk joints and the walking cycle. Results of the physical experiment and the simulation show that there are correlations between the joint viscoelasticity and the walking cycle, and thus, the proposed trunk mechanism is considered a suitable mechanism that controls the walking behavior of a semi-passive walker.",

        "abstract": "In this paper, we solve the path planning problem for a tethered mobile robot, which is connected to a fixed base by a cable of length L. The reachable space of the robot is restricted by the length of the cable and obstacles. The reachable space of the tethered robot can be computed by considering the topology class of the cable. However, it is computationally too expensive to compute this space a-priori. Instead, in this paper, we show how we can plan using a recently-developed variant of A* search, called Multi-Heuristic A*. Normally, the Multi-Heuristic A* algorithm takes in a fixed set of heuristic functions. In our problem, however, the heuristics represent length of paths to the goal along different topology classes, and there can be too many of them and not all the topology classes are useful. To deal with this, we adapt Multi-Heuristic A* to work with a dynamically generated set of heuristic functions. It starts out as a normal weighted A*. Whenever the search gets trapped in a local minimum, we find the proper topology class of the path to escape from it and add the corresponding new heuristic function into the set of heuristic functions considered by the search. We present experimental analysis comparing our approach with weighted A* on planning for a tethered robot in simulation.",

        "abstract": "Multi robot formation is a canonical problem in robotic research. The problem has been examined in neutral environments, where the robots' goal is usually to maintain the formation despite changes in the environment. The problem of multi robot formation has been motivated by natural phenomena such as schools of fish or flocks of birds. While in the natural phenomena the team behavior is responsive to threats, in robotics research of team formation, adversarial presence has been ignored. In this paper we present the problem of adversarial formation, in which a team of robots travels in a connected formation through an adversarial environment that includes threats that may harm the robots. The robots' goal is, therefore, to maximize their chance of traveling through the environment unharmed, where the formation may be used as a mean to achieve this goal. We formally define the problem, present a quantitative measure for evaluating the survivability of the team, and suggest possible solutions to a variant of the problem under certain threat characteristics, optimizing different team survivability criteria. Finally, we discuss the challenges raised by transitioning the discrete representation to a continuous environment in simulation.",

A unique algorithm for tracking and searching ground images with natural texture is used to localize the robot without a feature-point extraction scheme commonly used in other visual odometry methods. In our tracking algorithm, groups of reference pixels are used to detect the relative translation and rotation between frames. Furthermore, a reference pixel group of another shape is registered both to record a path and to correct errors accumulated during localization. All image processing and robot control operations are carried out with low memory consumption for image registration and fast calculation times for completing the searches on a laptop PC. We also describe experimental results in which a vehicle developed by the proposed method repeatedly performed precise path tracking under indoor and outdoor environments.",

        "abstract": "Patrolling is an important task for autonomous mobile robots. In this paper, we focus on a single patrolling robot in indoor environments composed of rooms. For the robot, it is required to visit the rooms and detect unknown intruders as many as possible. However, the robot does not have correct information about intruders in the initiation step of patrolling. Therefore, the robot first acquires the information through the patrolling trials. As for the information, the robot focuses on intrusion probabilities into the rooms. Subsequently, target rooms are determined on the basis of the intrusion probabilities. This so-called explore/exploit tradeoff in reinforcement learning is a challenge for the intelligent patrolling. In this paper, we tackle the patrolling problem as a part of the learning issues. Thus a multi-armed bandit problem is introduced. For the challenge, we propose stochastic patrolling strategies based on Bayesian learning. Simulation experiments show that the robot is enabled to estimate the correct intrusion probabilities of the rooms. Through the discussion of the patrolling results, finally, we present the most effective patrolling strategy.",

        "abstract": "Perching on a vertical surface carries the risk of severe damage to the vehicle if the maneuver fails, especially if failure goes undetected. We present a detection method using an onboard 3-axis accelerometer to discriminate between perching success and failure. An analytical model was developed to calculate acceleration differences for success and failure and set decision times. Two distinct decision times were shown to be effective, corresponding to properly engaging the gripper and overloading the gripper's capabilities. According to a machine learning feature selection algorithm, the maximum Z axis acceleration of the quadrotor and the presence of near-zero readings are the most relevant features within these two time frames. Using these features, the detection algorithm discriminated between success and failure with a 91% accuracy at 40 ms, and 94% at 80 ms. Real-time detection and failure recovery experiments with a 20 g quadrotor verify the detection method. An improved approach that combines various decision times correctly identified success/failure for all 20 trials with an average total falling distance of 0.8m during recovery. We discuss the feasibility of extending our method to other quadrotor platforms.",

MRF-based actuators exhibit superior characteristics, which can significantly contribute to the transparency and stability of haptic devices. To validate this statement, a prototype two degrees-of-freedom (DoF) haptic interface is constructed. A distributed antagonistic configuration is used in order to develop the 2-DoF haptic interface based on small-scale MRF-based clutches for a class of medical applications. The developed device is compared with three conventional haptic interfaces and their stability is compared using the Virtual Wall experiment. Next, the prototype interface is incorporated in a master-slave teleoperation medical setup. Preliminary studies on the performance of the haptic interface show great potential of MRF-based actuators for integration in haptic devices for medical interventions that require safe, accurate, and stable force representation.",

        "abstract": "Advanced countries are currently experiencing an aging society, and many people could benefit from a personal robot that can support a comfortable lifestyle. However, excessive and premature robot assistance may deteriorate the user's physical abilities and can accelerate their aging process. The authors have already proposed a personal robot that can follow the user, even on uneven road surfaces. Therefore, people utilizing this personal robot do not need to carry heavy baggage, even after shopping. It is reported that a few brisk walks per week can be advantageous to our health management and can improve our quality of life, so this means that the personal robot can encourage the user to maintain an active lifestyle. For this personal robot, close following is required to ensure the safety of the baggage and the personal robot. However, it is difficult for the conventional approach to avoid collisions when the user stops suddenly. In this paper, a control approach based on model predictive control is proposed to achieve two conflicting requirements: close following and no collision. The proposed approach predicts multiple future outcomes, in which the user either stops or accelerates in the next step, in order to realize an appropriate relative distance and to consider the upper and lower boundaries for posture stabilization. The effectiveness of the proposed approach can be verified in numerical simulations using a multibody dynamics model consisting of actual 3D representations.",

These models can be used to optimize a variety of human-robot collaboration scenarios for the comfort or ergonomics of an individual human collaborator. Our approach offers two main advantages over prior approaches from the literature and commercial software: the kinematic models are estimated for a specific individual without a priori assumptions on limb dimensions or range of motion, and our kinematic formalism explicitly encodes the natural kinematic constraints of the human body. The personalized models are tested in a human-robot collaborative manipulation experiment. We find that human subjects with a restricted range of motion rotate their torso significantly less during bimanual object handoffs if the robot uses a personalized kinematic model to plan the handoff configuration, as compared to previous approaches using generic human kinematic models.",

        "abstract": "The advantages of using the entire photometric image information as visual feature are: it does not require any feature detections, matching or tracking process. To enlarge the convergence domain, we propose to accomplish visual servoing based on the analytical formulation of Gaussian mixtures to model the images. During the servoing, we consider the optimization of the Gaussian spreads allowing the camera to converge to a desired pose even from a far initial one. Simulation that overcomes the state-of-the-art and real experiments highlight the success of our approach.",

        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "In off-road applications, where mobile robots operate on rough environments, the physical properties of the terrain play a key role on their performance. An extreme example is posed by planetary rover missions to Mars, for which communication constraints and the inability of vision-based approaches to detect non-geometric hazards, e.g. sand traps hidden below thin duricrusts, can lead to permanent immobilisation, as experienced by NASA's Spirit rover. To prevent such events, this paper proposes a method to classify dry granular soils according to their physical properties by using an on-board sensor system for on-line analysis of sinkage, slippage and vibrations of the hybrid wheel-legs mounted on a highly mobile robot. As reflected by the experimental results, obtained using a single wheel-leg test bed, the novel approach produces an efficient and robust differentiation of soils with dissimilar physical properties. This output can enable autonomous avoidance of non-geometric hazards without endangering the mobility of the mission. Different classifier algorithms are trained, validated and compared in terms of classification accuracy and computational efficiency, revealing the advantages and disadvantages of each approach.",

However, an interesting offshoot of these settings that has largely been overlooked is the problem of planning for serendipity - i.e. planning for stigmergic collaboration without explicit commitments on agents in co-habitation. In this paper we formalize this notion of planning for serendipity for the first time, and provide an Integer Programming based solution for this problem. Further, we illustrate the different modes of this planning technique on a typical Urban Search and Rescue scenario and show a real-life implementation of the ideas on the Nao Robot interacting with a human colleague.",

        "abstract": "Precise 3D mapping and 6DOF trajectory estimation using exteroceptive sensors are key problems in many fields. Real-time moving laser sensors gained popularity due to their precise depth measurements, high frame rate and large field of view. We propose an optimization framework for Simultaneous Localization And Mapping that properly models the acquisition process in a scanning-while-moving scenario. Each measurement is correctly reprojected in the map reference frame by considering a continuous time trajectory which is defined as the linear interpolation of a discrete set of control poses in SE3. The trajectory estimation is performed using the sensor readings only, i.e., no external motion measurement units are used. An efficient data structure that makes use of a hybrid sparse voxelized representation for large map management allows to perform global optimization over trajectories, resetting the accumulated drift when loops are detected. We experimentally show that such framework improves localization and mapping w.r.t. solutions that compensate the distortion effects without including them in the optimization step. Moreover, we show that the proposed map structure provides linear or constant time operations w.r.t. the map size in order to perform real time SLAM and it can handle very large maps.",

The estimator uses inertial sensor data only, the relative orientation around all axes is obtained without magnetometers. Instead, the accelerations of the skeleton's motion provide information about the otherwise missing degree of freedom. The method also yields the orientation of the skeleton as a whole except for the heading. In addition, a technique to decouple the estimation rate from the sensor sampling rate is introduced. The estimator both with and without rate decoupling is evaluated against ground truth data and yields relative orientations about 5 degrees off ground truth while the skeleton moves.",

Theoretical analysis is backed by experimental flight tests using a popular commercial quadrotor. Experiments on Commercial Off-The-Shelf Lithium-Polymer batteries, which are the technology dominating the multi-rotor Unmanned Aerial Vehicle market, are carried out to determine battery run-time and specific energy/capacity models, whilst investigating the battery variability. These battery models are combined with the rotorcraft power model to provide an endurance estimation model, accounting for both battery variability as well as the electric propulsion system effects, which is experimentally validated through flight tests.",

        "abstract": "Although considering dynamics in the control of humanoid robots can improve tracking and compliance in agile tasks, it requires local and global states of the system, precise torque control and proper modeling. In this paper we discuss practical issues to implement inverse dynamics on a torque controlled robot. By modeling electrical actuators offline, inverting such model and estimating the friction on-line, a high bandwidth torque controller is implemented. In addition, a cascade of optimization problems to fuse all the sensory data coming from IMU, joint encoders and contact force sensors estimate the robot's global state robustly. Our estimation builds the kinematic chain of the legs from the center of pressure which is more robust in case of slight slippage, tilting or rolling of the feet. Thanks to precise and fast torque control, robust state estimation and optimization-based whole body inverse dynamics, the real robot can keep balance with very small stiffness and damping in Cartesian space. It can also recover from strong pushes and perform dexterous tasks. The highly compliant and stable performance is based on pure torque control, without any joint damping or position/velocity tracking.",

Based on interval techniques and algorithms, the derived model permits to guarantee a bound on the precision value of the end effector. The method has been demonstrated with a numerical example of parallel microrobot devoted to orient the laser spot towards vocal fold during phonomicrosurgery. This example considers the uncertainties that occur in the compliant joints caused by the fabrication technique.",

        "abstract": "Prediction of interaction force between human and contacting environment has always been an important issue for such as robot control and clinical treatment. Although force/torque sensors can provide direct and precise measurement results, in many cases it is inconvenient to attach these sensors on the environment surface or on human beings. The purpose of this paper is to propose a prediction method for interaction force between human and contacting environment, using only electromyographic (EMG) signals. The motions are touch motion and push motion of upper extremity. Seven muscles of the upper limb were selected to record EMG signals. The predict function were derived from two muscle-skeleton models implemented for touch motion and push motion, respectively. The Bayesian linear regression (BLR) algorithm was implemented for parameters calibration. In order to avoid complex model for dynamic movement, a neural network classifier was used to recognize the force exerting motions. The proposed method was applied in a remote interaction force evaluation experiment. The \u201cPhantom Premium\u201d haptic device is used to represent the predicted force in the remote site. The experimental results show that the proposed method can provide acceptable prediction results with root-mean-square (RMS) error below 2.20 N.",

This is followed by a preliminary study to investigate baseline performance measures for motor assessment during reaching tasks as a step toward replacing conventional ordinal scales with continuous quantitative scales. Thirteen healthy and one participant with upper limb motor impairment participated in the study and performed reaching tasks with their dominant and non-dominant hands in three directions. The results from healthy subjects indicate no significant difference between different directions for both limbs and also between corresponding directions of dominant and non-dominant limbs (p > 0.05, all cases). However, differences in measures can be observed for the impaired subject.",

        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "Direct teleoperation with multisecond time-delayed telemetry between master and slave is challenging for humans to perform. When controlling a holonomic robot with many degrees of freedom, operators may incidentally provide commands in an intended direction without realizing their mistake until receiving feedback several seconds later. For some applications, imposing a virtual nonholonomic constraint (VNHC) on the motion of the end effector can help prevent operators from moving in an unintended direction by reducing the number of controllable degrees of freedom. This paper presents the development of a VNHC for a planar time-delayed telerobotic task, motivated by an on-orbit telerobotic satellite servicing operation. We also describe a nonholonomic virtual fixture (NHVF) that adheres to the VNHC to further reduce the potential for operators to input mistaken commands. We report the results of a pilot study in which teleoperation with a VNHC was found to have comparable task performance to holonomic planar teleoperation, while decreasing operator workload. The NHVF was found to decrease performance slightly, though user feedback indicated that a differently implemented virtual fixture and controller may improve performance.",

This additional sensor layer tracks the angle motion of robot hinges, to better guide robot assembling by folding and to perform more complicated tasks that requires feedback control, making folded robots more capable in real world applications. We introduce the fabrication process, property assessments, and demonstrate sensor performance by measuring folding angles of a cube and controlling folds on a gripper.",

The model is able to represent the poses of all parts, the relations, observations provided by vision techniques and prior knowledge in a unified probabilistic graph. Then the problem is stated as likelihood maximization estimation of pose parameters with the relations being the latent variables. Classification expectation maximization algorithm (CEM) is employed to solve the model. Besides, the contradiction between relations is incorporated as prior knowledge to better shape the posterior, thus guiding the algorithm find a more accurate solution. In experiments, both simulated and real world datasets are applied to evaluate the performance of our proposed method. The experimental results show that the AG gives better accuracy than the relations as deterministic variables (RDV) employed in some previous works due to the robustness and global consistency. Finally, the solution is implemented into a PBD system with ABB industrial robotic arm simulator as the execution stage, succeeding in real world captured assembly tasks.",

        "abstract": "Classical approaches towards learning coordinated movement tasks often represent a movement in a sequential and exclusive fashion. Introducing concurrency allows to decompose such tasks into a number of separate sequences, for instance for two different end-effectors. While this results in a compact and generic representation of the individual movement primitives (MPs), it is a hard problem to learn their temporal and causal organization. This paper presents a concept for learning movement tasks that require the coordination of several controlled effectors of a robot. We firstly introduce a concept to learn and estimate the progress of individual MPs from a low number of demonstrations. Secondly, we propose a representation of the task that incorporates several concurrent sequences of MPs. Combining these two elements allows to learn and reproduce coordinated bi-manual movement tasks robustly. The synchronization of the concurrent MPs is achieved implicitly using the progress prediction. The approach is evaluated in two simulation studies with a 25 degrees of freedom two-arm robot performing a pick-and-place task.",

        "abstract": "This paper focuses on a surveillance mission performed by an autonomous mobile robot in an environment. In this mission, the robot is required to detect as many intruders as possible by utilizing the mobility and monitoring capability. However, the robot does not know where and how many intruders are in the environment. Without the information, it is impossible for the robot to estimate an intrusion trend and detect the unknown intruders. For this challenge, we propose a novel surveillance method in order for the robot to estimate the intrusion trend. For this purpose, Bayes' rule is basically used. This probabilistic approach allows the robot to express the intruders through existence probability and appearance frequency. As the contribution of this paper, the robot is enabled to mainly monitor the places with the intrusion trend, in addition to other minor places. Through simulation experiments, the effectiveness of the proposed method for the unknown intruders is shown. Furthermore, an adaptability of the robot based on the probabilistic approach to various kinds of intrusion trends is discussed.",

The force-based atomic force microscope (AFM) can reach a very high precision in the structure machining, but the machining depth is difficult to predict for different sample material or machining parameters. The nano machining system in this paper adopts traditional displacement-based machining method, aiming at a few hundred nanometers machining depth. The machining tool (a probe) is kept motionless during the structure machining, so the structure size is determined by a high precise x/y/z three degree of freedoms (DOF) stage. A probe suspension with bridge-type amplification mechanism is designed and optimized, through the theoretical analysis and finite element analysis (FEA), the amplification factor, Z-direction stiffness and first natural frequency of the probe suspension are about 5, 5000N/m, 130HZ, respectively.",

TDMs are generally actuated by gear electric motors placed at the base of the robot, and consequently require complex cable tension feedback from force sensors or dynamic modelling to maintain cables under tension. This paper presents a high performance TDM actuated by magneto-rheological clutches along with a specialized motion control algorithm, termed Projected PID, that requires no tension feedback. A 2-DOF proof-of-concept TDM powered by magneto-rheological clutches is used to demonstrate overall controller performance, and a reconfigurable 2-DOF TDM powered by direct-drive electric motors is used to demonstrate the controller's ability to compensate for configuration variations and actuator failure. Experimental results also demonstrate the ability of Projected PID to control magneto-rheological cable-driven TDMs with high accuracy.",

        "abstract": "This paper addresses the problem of constrained motion for a manipulator performing a task while in contact with the environment, and investigates two force control frameworks, one based on projected inverse dynamics, and one based on optimal control. Firstly, we propose a control method based on projected inverse dynamics, which directly exploits the contact constraints to minimise the instantaneous joint torques needed to perform a task. Secondly, we propose an optimal control strategy which provides a tool to minimise the joint torques over an interval of time. We show how contact constraints can be used as optimisation constraints in the definition of the problem, and how to formulate the optimal control problem directly using projected dynamics. Initially we explore a positional control problem, where the robot is required to follow a desired path, and show that both of the proposed methods can satisfy the positional task while significantly reducing the joint torques as compared to simple kinematic control and also classical inverse dynamics control. We also show that the proposed optimal control method outperforms the pure projected inverse dynamics method in terms of minimising the required joint torques. We then show how each method can be extended to follow a desired path while also exerting a desired contact force. Again, the method incorporating optimal control is shown to satisfy the task requirements with significantly smaller commanded torques than the pure projected inverse dynamics method. To confirm the analysis, and demonstrate proof of concept, we present the results of empirical experiments with a simulated 3-degree-of-freedom planar manipulator which is constrained to move while in contact with a rigid surface.",

The distinct features of this model describing dynamics of the dependent coordinates are: i) The mass matrix M\u0305(q) is always positive definite even at singular configurations; ii) matrix equation is skew symmetric, where all nonlinear terms are lumped into vector C\u0305(q, q\u0307)q\u0307 after elimination of constraint forces. Eigenvalue analysis shows that the condition number of the constraint mass matrix can be minimized upon adequate selection of a scalar parameter called \u201cvirtual mass\u201d thereby reducing the sensitivity to round-off errors in numerical computation. It follows by derivation of two oblique projection matrices for computation of constraint forces and actuation forces. It is shown that projection-based model allows feedback control of dependent coordinates which, unlike reduced-order dependent coordinates, uniquely define spatial configuration of constrained systems.",

        "abstract": "We control the motion of helical microrobots with average diameter of 500 \u00b5m in two-dimensional (2D) and three-dimensional (3D) spaces using two synchronized rotating dipole fields. The utilization of the two synchronized dipole fields not only increases the magnetic torque exerted on the magnetic dipole of the helical microrobot but also eliminates the magnetic field gradients along its lateral directions. Our finite element simulations and experimental results show that the utilization of two rotating dipole fields increases the magnetic field by 100%, as opposed to single rotating magnetic field. In addition, we show that the magnetic field gradient within the workspace of the microrobot is eliminated. Therefore, the lateral oscillations of the helical microrobot are mitigated within the center of two rotating dipole fields, and hence the motion of the microrobot is stabilized inside tubes with relatively large inner diameters, as opposed to the diameter of the helical microrobot. This strategy allows the microrobot to compensate for gravity and swim in 3D space inside water reservoirs at an average speed of 0.25 body lengths per second. In addition, closed-loop motion control of the helical microrobot is achieved in 2D space at an average speed of 2 mm/s and maximum steady-state error of 100 \u00b5m.",

        "abstract": "An objective of an autonomous sociable robot is to meet the needs and preferences of a human user. However, this can sometimes be at the expense of the robot's own ability to understand social signals produced by the user. In particular, human preferences of distance (proxemics) to the robot can have significant impact on the performance rates of its automated speech and gesture recognition systems. In this work, we investigated how people perceive a sociable robot based on its performance at different locations. We performed an experiment in which a robot's ability to understand social signals was artificially attenuated across distance; robot maximum, minimum, and average performance rates were also varied. Participants (N = 160) instructed a robot using speech and pointing gestures, and then responded to a questionnaire to provide their subjective evaluations of the robot.We identified significant relationships between robot performance and user perceptions of robot competence, anthropomorphism, engagement, likability, and technology adoption; we identified no relationship between human-robot distance and subjective measures, which contrasts related work. Our results have significant implications for autonomous sociable robot design.",

The index is defined as a weighted sum of specific metrics which evaluate the similarities between the human and robot arm workspaces, providing a normalized score between 0 (non-anthropomorphic artifacts) and 1 (human-identical artifacts). The human arm workspaces were extracted using data reported in anthropometry studies. The formulation is general enough to allow utilization in various applications, by adjusting the weighting factors according to the specifications of each study. The proposed methodology can be used for assessing the human-likeness of existing robot arms as well as to provide specifications for the design of new anthropomorphic robots and prosthetic devices. To assess the efficiency of the proposed methods a comparative analysis between five kinematically different robot arm models is conducted and simulated paradigms are presented.",

As a measure for the smooth movement of mobile platform, the variations in height and pitch angle are chosen in this study. Then, the kinematic analysis on the Rocker-Bogie mechanism is carried out to investigate its variations in height and pitch angle on rough terrains. Based on this result, a new mobile platform is systematically designed by combining the Rocker-Bogie with the inverse four bar linkage. The extensive experiments are carried out by using the Rocker-Bogie mechanism and the proposed R-Mo against rough terrain, which validate that in comparison with the Rocker-Bogie mechanism, the average and maximum variations in height of proposed R-Mo are reduced by 12.72% and 5.96%, respectively, and the average and maximum variations in pitch angle of proposed R-Mo are considerably reduced by 65.87 % and 60.53 %, respectively.",

A major advantage of the method is that unlike other modelling tools, our reconstruction pipeline allows the user to acquire a full 3D model of the object. This is achieved by acquiring several partial 3D models in different sessions\u2014each individual session presenting the object of interest in different configurations that reveal occluded parts of the object \u2014 that are automatically merged together to reconstruct a full 3D model. In addition, the 3D models acquired by our system can be directly used by state-of-the-art object instance recognition and object tracking modules, providing object-perception capabilities to complex applications requiring these functionalities (e.g. human-object interaction analysis, robot grasping, etc.). The system does not impose constraints in the appearance of objects (textured, untextured) nor in the modelling setup (moving camera with static object or turn-table setups with static camera). The proposed reconstruction system has been used to model a large number of objects resulting in metrically accurate and visually appealing 3D models.",

        "abstract": "Robotics applications are characterized by a huge amount of variability. Their design requires the developers to choose between several variants, which relate to both functionalities and hardware. Some of these choices can be taken at deployment-time, however others should be taken at run-time, when more information about the context is known. To make this possible, a software system needs to be able to reason about its current state and to adapt its architecture to provide the configuration that best suites the context. This paper presents a model-based approach for run-time adaptation of robotic systems. It defines a set of orthogonal models that represent the system architecture, its variability, and the state of the context. Additionally it introduces a set of algorithms that reason about the knowledge represented in our models to resolve the run-time variability and to adapt the system architecture. The paper discusses and evaluates the approach by means of two case studies.",

        "abstract": "Vehicle localization in large-scale urban environments has been commonly addressed as a map-matching problem in the literature. Generally, the maps are 2D images of the world where each pixel covers a part of it. However, building maps for large-scale urban environments requires driving the vehicle along the desired path at least once. In order to simplify this task, in this work, we propose a new localization system that uses satellite aerial map-images available on the Internet to localize a vehicle in a complex urban environment. Satellite aerial map-images are compared against re-emission maps built from the infrared reflectance information of the vehicle's LiDAR. Normalized Mutual Information (NMI) is used to compare re-emission and aerial map images. A Particle Filter Localization strategy is applied for vehicle's localization. As a result, the system has an accuracy of 0.89m in a test course with 6.5km. Our system can be used continuously without losing track, and it works even in dark and partially occluded areas.",

        "abstract": "Agile robot locomotion on rough terrain is highly dependent on the ability to perceive the environment. In this paper, we show how the interaction between a reactive control framework and an online mapping system can significantly improve the trotting performance on irregular terrain. In particular, this new locomotion controller increases the stability of the robot and reduces frontal leg and shin collisions with obstacles by correcting in realtime the foothold locations. The mapping system uses an RGB-D sensor and a motion capture system to build a three dimensional map of the surroundings of the robot. While the robot is trotting, the control framework requests in advance a local heightmap around the next nominal foothold position. Then, an optimized foot placement location is estimated by applying visual pattern classification on the acquired heightmaps, and the leg endpoint trajectory is modified accordingly. The foothold correction is performed independently for each leg. To show the effectiveness of our approach the controller was tested both in simulation and experimentally with our 80 kg hydraulic quadruped robot, HyQ. The results show that visual based reaction through pattern classification is a promising approach to increase locomotion robustness over challenging terrain.",

A fairly large amount of work has been devoted to the whole-body control of humanoids under rigid contacts, but few of them take into account non-rigid contacts. Indeed, the handling of unknown compliant contacts to achieve goal directed actions and whole-body balance remains a challenge. This paper addresses this problem by proposing a control mechanism that solves whole-body tasks under non-rigid contacts. It is a reactive control approach that automatically regulates contact forces and whole-body motions based on the motion of contact points without the awareness of the rigidity properties of the contact material. Verification of this approach is conducted through experiments on the iCub humanoid robot in simulation.",

        "abstract": "Autonomous navigation of micro aerial vehicles (MAVs) in a-priori unknown environments is one of the most challenging problems in robotics. First, a MAV has to incrementally build a 3D geometric map from raw sensor data. Then, based on the mapping information, the path planner has to search for a cost-optimal trajectory to the goal in real-time. It is common practice to discretize the search space into a state lattice; by doing so, we reduce the path planning problem with differential constraints to a graph search problem that is easier to solve. However, a regular 3D state lattice requires a large amount of memory while graph search in a regular 3D state lattice incorporating numerous states is computationally intensive. In this paper, we introduce a novel path planning algorithm which extends the concept of a regular state lattice to an octree-based state lattice, and searches for an optimal trajectory in the octree-partitioned search space. Our octree-based state lattice representation discretizes large swathes of free space into few symbolic octants, and thus, encodes a significantly fewer number of states. As a result, memory consumption is kept to a minimum, and at the same time, graph search is made more efficient. Simulation experiments demonstrate the efficiency of path planning with an octree-based state lattice, and further field trials prove the viability of this path planning algorithm.",

While these models have been demonstrated to approximate actual behavior, modeling error can be significant for medical applications that often call for positioning accuracy of 1-2mm. As an alternative to moving to more complex models, this paper proposes using sensing to adaptively update model parameters during robot operation. Advantages of this method are that the model is constantly tuning itself to provide high accuracy in the region of the workspace where it is currently operating. It also adapts automatically to changes in robot shape and compliance associated with the insertion and removal of tools through its lumen. As an initial exploration of this approach, a recursive on-line estimator is proposed and evaluated experimentally.",

Following with the framework of incremental model-free multiple object tracking from our previous work [5][7][6], 6 DoF pose of each object is firstly estimated with input point-cloud data which is then segmented according to the estimated objects, and incremental model of each object is updated from the segmented point-clouds. Here, we propose Joint Color-Spatial Descriptor (JCSD) to enhance the robustness of the pose hypothesis evaluation to the point-cloud scene in the particle filtering framework. The method outperforms widely used point-to-point comparison methods, especially in the partially occluded scene, which is frequently happened in the dynamic object manipulation cases. By means of the robust descriptor, we achieved unsupervised multiple object segmentation accuracy higher than 99%. The model-free multiple object tracking was implemented by using a particle filtering with JCSD as a likelihood function. The robust likelihood function is implemented with GPU, thus facilitating real-time tracking of multiple objects.",

At the same time, it is also general, as it can be deployed with any frame-wise segmentation approach as well as any SLAM algorithm.

This paper builds on previous work with a parameterized turn-taking model, CADENCE, in which different parameter settings resulted in different social dynamics. In contrast to the static parameter settings of previous work, we now investigate the problem of changing these turn-taking parameter sets dynamically within a single interaction session. This ability is necessary for successful peer-to-peer collaborations, in which balance of control between leading and following must be maintained. We present our dynamic switching approach and an experiment with 15 participants. Our results confirm that it is possible to achieve the same changes in social dynamics within a single interaction session that were previously seen only between independent sessions of different parameter settings. Moreover, we show that such a change in social dynamics is contingent upon changing parameters at socially appropriate turn boundaries.",

        "abstract": "Nanoscale vibration, a critical nanomechanical property of cell membranes/walls, is a crucial aspect of cell physiology. However, limitations of current nanoscale vibration detecting methods remain the major obstacle for scientific study and cell vibration experiments. Due to the absence of effective method of feeble nanoscale vibration detecting, most sorts of quantitative and dynamic cell vibrations cannot be observed. Therefore, a real-time tracking detection method is vital for the study of cell physiology. In this paper, a real-time tracking detection of nanoscale vibrations based on sweep frequency (SF) - amplitude modulation (AM) method using cantilever sweep frequency as a carrier frequency was proposed. Furthermore, the process of tip-sample vibration coupling is analyzed by using the idea of amplitude modulation model. The nanoscle vibration detecting experiments were carried out on a piezoceramic disc, which can mimic cell vibrations. The experiment results show that the SF-AM AFM real-time vibration tracking and detecting approach can accurately detect and track feeble sample vibration within few nanometers amplitude.",

A key piece of information for such tasks are human attributes like gender, age, hair or clothing. In this paper, we address the problem of recognizing such attributes in RGB-D data from varying full-body views. To this end, we extend a recent tessellation boosting approach which learns the best selection, location and scale of a set of simple RGB-D features. The approach outperforms the original approach and a HOG baseline for five human attributes including gender, has long hair, has long trousers, has long sleeves and has jacket. Experiments on a multi-perspective RGB-D dataset with full-body views of over a hundred different persons show that the method is able to robustly recognize multiple attributes across different view directions and distances to the sensor with accuracies up to 90%. Our methods runs in real-time, achieving a classification rate of around 300 Hz for a single attribute.",

        "abstract": "Drift of the rotation estimate is a well known problem in visual odometry systems as it is the main source of positioning inaccuracy. We propose three novel algorithms to estimate the full 3D rotation to the surrounding Manhattan World (MW) in as short as 20 ms using surface-normals derived from the depth channel of a RGB-D camera. Importantly, this rotation estimate acts as a structure compass which can be used to estimate the bias of an odometry system, such as an inertial measurement unit (IMU), and thus remove its angular drift. We evaluate the run-time as well as the accuracy of the proposed algorithms on groundtruth data. They achieve zerodrift rotation estimation with RMSEs below 3.4\u00b0 by themselves and below 2.8\u00b0 when integrated with an IMU in a standard extended Kalman filter (EKF). Additional qualitative results show the accuracy in a large scale indoor environment as well as the ability to handle fast motion. Selected segmentations of scenes from the NYU depth dataset demonstrate the robustness of the inference algorithms to clutter and hint at the usefulness of the segmentation for further processing.",

Failure rates are particularly high in pediatric and elderly patients, whose veins tend to deform, move, or roll as the needle is introduced. To improve venipuncture accuracy in challenging patient populations, we have developed a portable device that autonomously servos a needle into a suitable vein under image guidance. The device operates in real time, combining near-infrared and ultrasound imaging, computer vision software, and a 9 degrees-of-freedom robot that servos the needle. In this paper, we present the kinematic and mechanical design of the latest generation robot. We then investigate in silico and in vitro the mechanics of vessel rolling and deformation in response to needle insertions performed by the robot. Finally, we demonstrate how the robot can make real-time adjustments under ultrasound image guidance to compensate for subtle vessel motions during venipuncture.",

In this paper, we propose a system for depalletizing and a complete pipeline for detecting and localizing objects as well as verifying that the found object does not deviate from the known object model, e.g., if it is not the object to pick. In order to achieve high robustness (e.g., with respect to different lighting conditions) and generality with respect to the objects to pick, our approach is based on multi-resolution surfel models. All components (both software and hardware) allow operation at high frame rates and, thus, allow for low cycle times. In experiments, we demonstrate depalletizing of automotive and other prefabricated parts with both high reliability (w.r.t. success rates) and efficiency (w.r.t. low cycle times).",

        "abstract": "In this paper we present a step-planner embedded in a framework which enables a humanoid robot to navigate among obstacles, exploiting its overall capacities. The system allows the robot to react to changes of user input or changes in a dynamic environment in real-time while walking at reasonable speeds. The proposed method relies neither on external sensors nor on color coding or textured surfaces. The key idea is to use a fast collision model based on swept-sphere-volumes (SSVs) for real-time generation of collision-free footsteps and whole-body trajectories. Using a SSV-based 3D approximation in all control modules enables the robot to avoid collisions with itself and the environment. Obstacles are detected with an on-board RGB-D sensor while the robot navigates through an environment which is not known in advance. A step-planner reacts to high-level user commands like desired velocity and direction or changes in the environment within less than a step. Instead of investigating only the footholds an articulated 3D approximation of the lower leg and the foot is considered to find feasible and optimal footstep locations. Additionally, it provides an initial solution for the swing-foot movement. Finally, collision-free swing-foot trajectories are created in real-time in the feedback control layer using all the foot's degrees of freedom. We validated this approach in experiments with our robot Lola.",

        "abstract": "With today's advanced 3D scanner technology, huge amounts of point cloud data can be generated in short amounts of time. Data compression is thus necessary for storage and especially for transmission, e.g., via wireless networks. While previous approaches delivered good compression ratios and interesting theoretical insights, they are either computationally expensive or do not support incrementally acquired data and locally decompressing the data, two requirements we found necessary in many applications. We present a compression approach that is efficient in storage requirements as well as in computational cost, as it can compress and decompress point cloud data in real-time. Furthermore, it is capable of compressing incrementally acquired data, local decompression and of decompressing a subsampled representation of the original data. Our method is based on local 2D parameterizations of surface point cloud data, for which we describe an efficient approach. We suggest the usage of standard image compression techniques for the compression of local details. While exhibiting state-of-the-art compression ratios, our approach remains easy to implement. In our evaluation, we compare our approach to previous ones and discuss the choice of parameters. Due to our algorithm's efficiency, we consider it as a reference concerning speed and compression rates.",

To integrate ReFrESH and robotic application-level software more conveniently, it is necessary to develop a module design framework to support implementation of self-adaptive real-time software. To this end, based on the port-based object abstraction and port-automation theory, we propose the Extended Port-Based Object (E-PBO). E-PBO has two main advantages: (1) it builds the basis of a programming model to provide specific, yet flexible, guidelines to robotics application engineers for creating and integrating software modules; (2) it forms the basis of a self-adaption model to provide specific methods for evaluating the running task configuration and estimating the new but non-running task configuration (if required) without interfering with the running configuration. E-PBO has been incorporated into the Port-Based Object Real-Time Operating System (PBO/RT) and applied to a visual servoing robotic application, which is demonstrated here.",

This solution is expected to be useful for enhanced manipulation of humanoid robotic systems. Our framework relies on a prior visual segmentation of the object in the image. The segmented point cloud is registered first in a rigid manner and then by non-rigidly fitting the mesh, based on the Finite Element Method to model elasticity, and on geometrical point-to-point correspondences to compute external forces exerted on the mesh. The real-time performance of the system is demonstrated on synthetic and real data involving challenging deformations and motions.",

Given information in the form of a small set of rules and driving heuristics the planning system optimizes trajectories in a seven dimensional state space. In a post-processing step a set of candidates is evaluated considering the uncertainty of the vehicles motion executing the given trajectory using a Linear-Quadratic Gaussian (LQG). This addresses the problem of indecisive planning behavior in case the optimal solution is unlikely to be followed precisely. The results of our experiments show that the mobile graphics processing unit (GPU) technology can be used as an enabler for real-time applications of computationally expensive planning approaches.",

On-line estimation is performed with a least-squares estimator employing a nonlinear state observer model computed with trep, a dynamics simulation package. Baxter is tasked with estimating the length of a string connected to a load suspended from the gripper with a load cell providing the single source of feedback to the estimator. Several trials are presented with varying initial estimates showing convergence to the actual length within a 6 second time-frame.",

Though there has been extensive work in vision-based localization in recent years, including several systems that show real-time performance, none have been demonstrated running entirely on-board in closed loop on robotic platforms. We propose a fast, real-time localization system that keeps the existing local visual-inertial odometry frame consistent for controllers and collision avoidance, while correcting drift and alignment to a global coordinate frame. We demonstrate our localization system entirely on-board an aerial and ground robot, showing a collaboration experiment where both robots are able to localize against the same map accurately enough to allow the multicopter to land on top of the ground robot. We also perform extensive evaluations for the proposed closed-loop system on ground-truth datasets from MAV flight in an industrial setting.",

This is solely based on vision and IMU measurements with all components running onboard and in real-time. We use visual-inertial odometry to keep the MAV airborne safely locally, as well as for exploration of the environment based on high-level input by an operator. A globally consistent map is constructed in the background, which is then used to correct for drift of the visual odometry algorithm. This map serves as an input to our proposed global planner, which finds dynamic 3D paths to any previously visited place in the map, without the use of teach and repeat algorithms. In contrast to previous work, all components are executed onboard and in real-time without any prior knowledge of the environment.",

Inspired from the natural human harvesting behaviour, our goal is to build a humanoid robot to pick tomatoes autonomously or with minimal human efforts. The proposed vision approach uses fusion of calibrated observation data from two RGB-D sensors installed on the head and the hand of the humanoid. We observe the natural human harvesting behaviour and equip our robot with similar grippers to follow the same picking processes for a specific fruit. In the vision approach, we mainly focus on modelling fruits in one branch and then estimating the pedicel direction of each fruit in a branch. Through pointcloud model segmentation, the primitive shape model of each fruit can be obtained and we consider a simple fact that crops in one branch should remain stable with respect to gravity and interaction forces from neighbouring crops in the branch. According to this assumption, a probabilistic model is created and the picking order in the branch is assigned under the evaluated geometrical structure. In the experiments, we tested harvesting of real tomatoes on actual branches and evaluated the successful harvesting rate.",

Our hardware consists of a Hummingbird quadrotor equipped with a large red marker with two built-in fish-eye cameras. Fusion of the measurements from the two cameras is done using a Gaussian-mixture probability hypothesis density filter, which allows for tracking several aircrafts at the same time. Our collision avoidance algorithm is based on navigation functions designed to cope with cameras characterized by limited field of view. Its mathematical correctness has been proven in a former paper [1]. The collision avoidance maneuver is performed without the vehicles explicitly exchanging information via communication but instead relying solely on on-board sensors. Our system has been validated in an indoor space with four different collision scenarios. Trajectory data was recorded with an external motion capture system and demonstrate good robustness against sensing noise.",

        "abstract": "The use of emotional states for Human-Robot Interaction (HRI) has attracted considerable attention in recent years. One of the most challenging tasks is to recognize the spontaneous expression of emotions, especially in an HRI scenario. Every person has a different way to express emotions, and this is aggravated by the complexity of interaction with different subjects, multimodal information and different environments. We propose a deep neural model which is able to deal with these characteristics and which is applied in recognition of complex mental states. Our system is able to learn and extract deep spatial and temporal features and to use them to classify emotions in sequences. To evaluate the system, the CAM3D corpus is used. This corpus is composed of videos recorded from different subjects and in different indoor environments. Each video contains the recording of the upper-body part of the subject expressing one of twelve complex mental states. Our system is able to recognize spontaneous complex mental states from different subjects and can be used in such an HRI scenario.",

        "abstract": "The presence of robots not only in industrial settings but also in operating rooms is increasing with advancements in technology. They are not only huge machines carrying out tedious and arduous tasks while being caged behind fences, but also work in collaboration, close proximity of, and in cooperation with humans. Image guided minimally invasive approaches to accurately navigate a robot to precise anatomical locations can be followed only once the robot is registered to the medical imaging system. In this paper, we present an approach to register a robotic system to a medical imaging system without the use of any tracking device or continuous X-ray imaging. The system consists of a lightweight robot equipped with internal torque sensors. The registration is realized by a series of landmark transformations. The robot is manually moved and guided to distinct landmarks whose positions are known in the coordinate system of the imaging system. By driving the robot to these distinct landmarks, their position relative to the coordinate system of the robotic system is also known. By comparing the respective positions of the landmarks in the two coordinate systems, both systems are registered. With 8 screws on the operating table used as landmarks for this registration, we obtain a median error of [6.9, 20.6, 18.6] mm and a standard deviation of [2.9, 2.6, 2.2] mm when compared to an X-ray based ground truth.",

The performance of the proposed variable admittance controller is investigated on a co-manipulation task with a number of subjects using a KUKA LWR robot, demonstrating considerable reduction both in the effort required by the operator and in the completion time of the task.",

However, comparing reinforcement learning against human programming is not straightforward. In this paper, we create a motor learning framework consisting of state-of-the-art components in motor skill learning and compare it to a manually designed program on the task of robot tetherball. We use dynamical motor primitives for representing the robot's trajectories and relative entropy policy search to train the motor framework and improve its behavior by trial and error. These algorithmic components allow for high-quality skill learning while the experimental setup enables an accurate evaluation of our framework as robot players can compete against each other. In the complex game of robot tetherball, we show that our learning approach outperforms and wins a match against a high quality hand-crafted system.",

In the micro manipulation, the release task is the challenge work due to adhesion forces. To overcome the adhesion force and to place microobject accurately on the desired location, in this paper, we propose a high speed motion by analyzing dynamic model of manipulated end effector and attached microbeads. Two fingered microhand driven by DC motors and PZT actuators is utilized for this paper. Parallel mecahnism with three PZT actuators was used for making 3D motion at high speed. To generatge high acceleration of end effector, many researchers applied simple vibration by using an additional PZT actuator. In our research, 3D high speed motion with large amplitude was achieved by only using a compacted parallel mechanism. To verify the advantage of the proposed motion, we compare five motions, 1D motions (X, Y, and Z direction) and circular motions (clockwise and counterclockwise direction), by changing the frequency and moving distance of the end effector. From these results of experiments, we conclude that the circular motion can detach microobjects with high placing accuracy after release.",

The approach uses a novel type of capacitive sensor, which can measure internal properties of materials that are inaccessible to vision or tactile sensing. The electrodes of this capacitive sensor are sufficiently flexible and thin to be attached to various types of robot tools, including humanoid fingers and palms. They are mechanically robust and wear resistant. In comparison to earlier capacitive sensors systems, we perform single ended and differential measurements over an array of electrodes, and coordinate measurement with robot manipulation to extract information not available from static measurements. We demonstrate the capability of our active object categorization system in the James robot bartender system. This system can manipulate objects and measure continuously in order to categorize empty and non-empty bottles. The principle of capacitive sensing during manipulation can be applied to more general object manipulation tasks in robotics and also in other fields of industrial automation.",

We show that maintaining the stochasticity of these variables in the planning formulation leads to a random belief covariance matrix, allowing us to consider the risk associated with the acquisition in the objective function. Inspired by modern portfolio theory and utility optimization, we design objective functions that are risk-averse, and show that risk-averse planning leads to decisions made by the robot that are desirable when operating under uncertainty. We show the benefit of this approach using simulations of a planar robot traversing an uncertain environment and of an underwater robot searching for loop-closure actions while performing visual SLAM.",

When using standalone computation with mono-frequency receivers, positioning errors are not in accordance with the required performance. Nevertheless, since errors are strongly time-correlated, a GPS fix is quite informative if a shaping model of the positioning errors is carefully handled and made possible by exteroceptive sensors. When driving in a road with a camera detecting lane markings, the lateral error is directly observable by using a lane marking map. It can be well modeled by mixing auto-regressive and random constant models. An algebraic observability study is conducted to prove that this modeling is completely observable in a road frame. A new road invariant Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) is then presented to conserve the observability of every component of the state vector for any road whatever its orientation. The filter manages road changes by using bijective transformations that are detailed. Real experimental results indicate that the performance of the estimation process is significantly improved compared to a classic EKF that is implemented in a fixed working frame with a less informative error modeling.",

        "abstract": "Since its official introduction in 2012, the Robot Web Tools project has grown tremendously as an open-source community, enabling new levels of interoperability and portability across heterogeneous robot systems, devices, and front-end user interfaces. At the heart of Robot Web Tools is the rosbridge protocol as a general means for messaging ROS topics in a client-server paradigm suitable for wide area networks, and human-robot interaction at a global scale through modern web browsers. Building from rosbridge, this paper describes our efforts with Robot Web Tools to advance: 1) human-robot interaction through usable client and visualization libraries for more efficient development of front-end human-robot interfaces, and 2) cloud robotics through more efficient methods of transporting high-bandwidth topics (e.g., kinematic transforms, image streams, and point clouds). We further discuss the significant impact of Robot Web Tools through a diverse set of use cases that showcase the importance of a generic messaging protocol and front-end development systems for human-robot interaction.",

Situations they encounter might differ only in subtle, but important details in context and parameterization that have a massive impact on an action's outcome. To avoid the effort of encoding all possible combinations of subtleties into plans, we present a prediction framework that gives robot agents an intuition of their actions' effects and for choosing parameter values that have proven to be useful before. We let a robot form these predictions and expectations from episodic memories collected during earlier plan executions, improving its own behavior with every new situation encountered. We evaluate and explain our approach using experiments performed on a PR2 robot performing complex mobile manipulation activities in a kitchen environment.",

        "abstract": "To analyze auditory scenes of robots' surrounding environments, not only speeches but also non-speech sounds are important, which are spatially distributed and have different spectral and temporal characteristics. Thus, this paper investigates Acoustic Event Identification (AEI) which includes problems of localization, detection, and identification of sound sources. To achieve AEI by a robot in a real environment, we first propose to use a robot audition framework including sound source localization and separation to localize, detect, and separate acoustic events. For the identification, we propose two Bayesian models, iterative Latent Dirichlet Allocation (it-LDA) and Nested Pitman-Yor process with Uncertainty Compensation (NPY-UC). it-LDA and NPY-UC extract noise-robust sound-units and sound-words, respectively, and they consider probabilistic spectral and temporal uncertainties to robustify AEI against harsh environments such as noise and reverberation, etc. We have implemented these proposed methods using a robot-embedded microphone array. The preliminary results showed 5\u201318 pts improvement compared to a conventional GMM method in noisy environments thanks to the Bayesian framework in consideration of uncertainties.",

The paper gives an overview of the developed companion robot, its system architecture, and essential skills, behaviors, and services required for a robotic health assistant. Moreover, it presents a new approach allowing a quantitative description and assessment of the navigation complexity of apartments to make them objectively comparable for function tests under real-life conditions. Based on this approach, the results of function tests executed in 12 apartments of project staff and seniors are described. Furthermore, the paper presents findings of a case study conducted with nine seniors (aged 68-92) in their own homes, investigating both instrumental and social-emotional functions of a robotic health assistant. The robot accompanied the seniors in their homes for up to three days assisting with tasks of their daily schedule and health care, without any supervising person being present on-site. Results revealed that the seniors appreciated the robot's health-related instrumental functions and even built emotional bonds with it.",

We consider that robot programming can be made more efficient, precise and intuitive if we leverage the advantages of complementary approaches such as learning from demonstration, learning from feedback and knowledge transfer. Starting from low-level demonstrations of assembly tasks, the system is able to extract a high-level relational plan of the task. A graphical user interface (GUI) allows then the user to iteratively correct the acquired knowledge by refining high-level plans, and low-level geometrical knowledge of the task. This combination leads to a faster programming phase, more precise than just demonstrations, and more intuitive than just through a GUI. A final process allows to reuse high-level task knowledge for similar tasks in a transfer learning fashion. Finally we present a user study illustrating the advantages of this approach.",

        "abstract": "This paper describes a Robot-Audition based Car Human Machine Interface (RA-CHMI). A RA-CHMI, like a car navigation system, has difficulty dealing with voice commands, since there are many noise sources in a car, including road noise, air-conditioner, music, and passengers. Microphone array processing developed in robot audition, may overcome this problem. Robot audition techniques, including sound source localization, Voice Activity Detection (VAD), sound source separation, and barge-in-able processing, were introduced by considering the characteristics of RA-CHMI. Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR), based on a Deep Neural Network (DNN), improved recognition performance and robustness in a noisy environment. In addition, as an integrated framework, HARK-Dialog was developed to build a multi-party and multi-modal dialog system, enabling the seamless use of cloud and local services with pluggable modular architecture. The constructed multi-party and multimodal RA-CHMI system did not require a push-to-talk button, nor did it require reducing the audio volume or air-conditioner when issuing speech commands. It could also control a four-DOF robot agent to make the system's responses more understandable. The proposed RA-CHMI was validated by evaluating essential techniques in the system, such as VAD and DNN-ASR, using real speech data recorded during driving. The entire design of the RA-CHMI system, including the system response time and the proper use of cloud/local services, are also discussed.",

        "abstract": "This work presents a human-robot cooperative approach for infrastructure inspection. The goal is to create a robot that assists the human inspector during hammer sounding inspections. Hammer sounding is a frequently used inspection technique that detects invisible defects under the surface of concrete by striking the surface with a hammer and listening the resulting sound. The conventional hammer sounding inspection is time-consuming, and there is no convenient way to represent exhaustively the test results. The proposed approach solves these two problems by having an assistant robot following the inspector, and always being able to look at the hammer impact position. The assistant robot accurately estimates the position of the impact in real-time and creates a detailed representation of the test results. Experimental results show the process for creating the detailed inspection report. The accuracy of the human-robot cooperative approach is evaluated for a real world application. The average error of the impact point estimation was 32 millimeters and the standard deviation was 30 millimeters.",

        "abstract": "In current flexible endoscopy, manipulating the endoscope is a major problem for surgeons. No surgeon can master the procedure without much experience. Accordingly, the objective of this study is to refine our Robotic Flexible Laparoscope System (RFLS) with more useful functions. We design a new kind of laparoscope mechanism suited for our RFLS. Furthermore, in maneuvering the laparoscope intuitively, the most significant advantage is the ability of RFLS can at least save three anatomical positions, which could be retrieved by a single command with small errors. Moreover, protective algorithm is also included in our system to make sure that over rotation of the gyro sensor, which is mounted the head, does not cause any damage. Experimental results demonstrate that the articulated flexible laparoscope can always memorize the required points and return back to those points in all necessary orientations.",

        "abstract": "Many future application scenarios of robotics envision robotic agents to be in close physical interaction with humans: On the factory floor, robotic agents shall support their human co-workers with the dull and health threatening parts of their jobs. In their homes, robotic agents shall enable people to stay independent, even if they have disabilities that require physical help in their daily life - a pressing need for our aging societies. A key requirement for such robotic agents is that they are safety-aware, that is, that they know when actions may hurt or threaten humans and actively refrain from performing them. Safe robot control systems are a current research focus in control theory. The control system designs, however, are a bit paranoid: programmers build \u201csoftware fences\u201d around people, effectively preventing physical interactions. To physically interact in a competent manner robotic agents have to reason about the task context, the human, and her intentions. In this paper, we propose to extend cognition-enabled robot control by introducing humans, physical interaction events, and safe movements as first class objects into the plan language. We show the power of the safety-aware control approach in a real-world scenario with a leading-edge autonomous manipulation platform. Finally, we share our experimental recordings through an online knowledge processing system, and invite the reader to explore the data with queries based on the concepts discussed in this paper.",

        "abstract": "This paper presents a novel vision-based underwater robotic system for the identification and control of Crown- Of-Thorns starfish (COTS) in coral reef environments. COTS have been identified as one of the most significant threats to Australia's Great Barrier Reef. These starfish literally eat coral, impacting large areas of reef and the marine ecosystem that depends on it. Evidence has suggested that land-based nutrient runoff has accelerated recent outbreaks of COTS requiring extensive use of divers to manually inject biological agents into the starfish in an attempt to control population numbers. Facilitating this control program using robotics is the goal of our research. In this paper we introduce a vision-based COTS detection and tracking system based on a Random Forest Classifier (RFC) trained on images from underwater footage. To track COTS with a moving camera, we embed the RFC in a particle filter detector and tracker where the predicted class probability of the RFC is used as an observation probability to weight the particles, and we use a sparse optical flow estimation for the prediction step of the filter. The system is experimentally evaluated in a realistic laboratory setup using a robotic arm that moves a camera at different speeds and heights over a range of real-size images of COTS in a reef environment.",

In this paper we explore the use of imagebased feedback to address tissue deformation when aspirating a hemorrhage in a phantom model. This is the first time intraoperative image feedback has been used with a concentric tube robot in this application. We describe a layer by layer approach to motion planning. Computed tomography (CT) images are collected periodically during hemorrhage removal. After each CT scan, the robot's tip path is re-planned to account for the tissue deformation that has occurred since the previous scan. We compare open loop hemorrhage removal to our sequential imaging-replanning approach, illustrating that the latter has the potential to enhance the safety and efficacy of the procedure.",

        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "This paper develops a novel robotic joint mechanism by means of twisting a small-diameter round-belt, which enables slow movements of joint rotation unlike direct-drive actuator mechanisms. The actuator mechanism proposed in this manuscript is composed of two small-diameter round-belts located near the joint with opposite configurations. The two round-belts are twisted by DC motors placed on a motor stage, which can be activated by a step motor. This novel mechanism realizes movement of the robotic joint around its axis due to contraction forces generated by twisting both round-belts. That is, these round-belts act as agonist and antagonist actuators for the robotic joint, which give a human-like compliance to the rotational motion of the joint. Experimental results using the proposed one-link robot show that a high position resolution of the joint control can be achieved by increases and decreases in the amount of twisting. In addition, we clearly indicate a linear relationship between twisting and the joint angle of the robot. Finally, this paper reveals that the antagonistic twist-actuator system has a secondary role as a gear reducer that is capable of largely decreasing the velocity of joint movement.",

        "abstract": "Realizing accurate robotic manipulation of flexible objects is very challenging. It asks for dexterous manipulation skill, and demands good adaptation to dynamic uncertainties due to deformation. Unlike traditional methods that basically depend on complex modeling, we follow the opposite approach by exploring possible simplifications based on high-speed motion strategy as well as high-speed visual sensing. As an application task concerned with robotic needle threading, this work demonstrates our philosophy by proposing a novel and straightforward high-speed strategy to speed up the manipulation while solves the issue of deformation uncertainty at the same time. The methodology is based on a very simple physical fact, namely that by rotating a thread with sufficient velocity, the thread can be approximated as a rigid object caused by the constantly applied centrifugal force during the rotation. Therefore, the needle threading problem is converted into a simpler peg-insertion problem, and the complexity of interaction between robot and deformable thread is significantly simplified. Based on the proposed strategy, simple technical methods then become possible for adoption to accomplish the challenging task. Experiments show that the proposed approach allows the needle threading task to be realized very rapidly.",

In this study, we aimed to achieve dexterous paper folding by extracting some dynamic motion primitives. Each primitive contains visual or force information, a physical model of a sheet of paper is used for analyzing its deformation, and a machine learning method is used for predicting its future state. We also propose a strategy for achieving valley folds in a sheet of paper twice in a row. One problem faced in folding paper is that, in the second fold, the crease line of the first fold disturbs the folding accuracy. We propose some new manipulation techniques to solve this problem.

        "abstract": "This paper introduces a novel concept of an air bearing test bench for CubeSat ground testing together with the corresponding dynamic parameter identification method. Contrary to existing air bearing test benches, the proposed concept allows three degree-of-freedom unlimited rotations and minimizes the influence of the test bench on the tested CubeSat. These advantages are made possible by the use of a robotic wrist which rotates air bearings in order to make them follow the CubeSat motion. Another keystone of the test bench is an accurate balancing of the tested CubeSat. Indeed, disturbing factors acting on the satellite shall be minimized, the most significant one being the gravity torque. An efficient balancing requires the CubeSat center of mass position to be accurately known. Usual techniques of dynamic parameter identification cannot be directly applied because of the frictionless suspension of the CubeSat in the test bench and, accordingly, due to the lack of external actuation. In this paper, a new identification method is proposed.

        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "We consider how to directly extract a road map (also known as a topological representation) of an initially-unknown 2-dimensional environment via an on-line procedure which robustly computes a retraction of its boundaries. While such approaches are well known for their theoretical elegance, computing such representations in practice is complicated when the data is sparse and noisy. In this paper we present the online construction of a topological map and the implementation of a control law for guiding the robot to the nearest unexplored area. The proposed method operates by allowing the robot to localize itself on a partially constructed map, calculate a path to unexplored parts of the environment (frontiers), compute a robust terminating condition when the robot has fully explored the environment, and achieve loop closure detection. The proposed algorithm results in smooth safe paths for the robot's navigation needs. The presented approach is an any-time-algorithm which allows for the active creation of topological maps from laser-scan data, as it is being acquired. The resulting map is stable under variations to noise and the initial conditions. The key idea is the use of a flux-based skeletonization algorithm on the latest occupancy grid map. We also propose a navigation strategy based on a heuristic where the robot is directed towards nodes in the topological map that open to empty space. The method is evaluated on both synthetic data and in the context of active exploration using a Turtlebot 2. Our results demonstrate complete mapping of different environments with smooth topological abstraction without spurious edges.",

In this paper we use machine learning to learn in-hand manipulation of such various sized and shaped objects. The TWENDY-ONE hand is used, which has various properties that makes it well suited for in-hand manipulation: a high number of actuated joints, passive degrees of freedom and soft skin, six-axis force/torque (F/T) sensors in each fingertip, and distributed tactile sensors in the skin. A dataglove is used to gather training samples for teaching the required behavior. The object size information is extracted from the initial grasping posture. After training a neural network, the robot is able to manipulate objects of untrained sizes and shape. The results show the importance of size and tactile information. Compared to interpolation control, the adaptability for the initial posture gap could be greatly extended. Final results show that with deep learning the number of required training sets can be drastically reduced.",

        "abstract": "Incorrect landmark and loop closure measurements can cause standard SLAM algorithms to fail catastrophically. Recently, several SLAM algorithms have been proposed that are robust to loop closure errors, but it is shown in this paper that they cannot provide robust solutions when landmark measurement errors occur. The root cause of this problem is that the robust SLAM algorithms only focus on generating solutions that are locally consistent (i.e. each measurement agrees with its corresponding estimates) rather than globally consistent (i.e. all of the measurements in the solution agree with each other). Moreover, these algorithms do not attempt to maximize the number of correct measurements included in the solution, meaning that often correct measurements are ignored and the solution quality suffers as a result. This paper proposes a new formulation of the robust SLAM problem that seeks a globally consistent map that also maximizes the number of measurements included in the solution. In addition, a novel incremental SLAM algorithm, called incremental SLAM with consistency-checking, is developed to solve the new robust SLAM problem. Finally, simulated and experimental results show that the new algorithm significantly outperforms state-of-the-art robust SLAM methods for datasets with incorrect landmark measurements and can match their performance for datasets with incorrect loop closures.",

        "track": "main",
        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "Robots based on tensegrity structures have the potential to be robust, efficient and adaptable. While traditionally being difficult to control, recent control strategies for ball-shaped tensegrity robots have successfully enabled punctuated rolling, hill-climbing and obstacle climbing. These gains have been made possible through the use of machine learning and physics simulations that allow controls to be \u201clearned\u201d instead of being engineered in a top-down fashion. While effective in simulation, these emergent methods unfortunately give little insight into how to generalize the learned control strategies and evaluate their robustness. These robustness issues are especially important when applied to physical robots as there exists errors with respect to the simulation, which may prevent the physical robot from actually rolling. This paper describes how the robustness can be addressed in three ways: 1) We present a dynamic relaxation technique that describes the shape of a tensegrity structure given the forces on its cables; 2) We then show how control of a tensegrity robot \u201cball\u201d for locomotion can be decomposed into finding its shape and then determining the position of the center of mass relative to the supporting polygon for this new shape; 3) Using a multi-step Monte Carlo based learning algorithm, we determine the structural geometry that pushes the center of mass out of the supporting polygon to provide the most robust basic mobility step that can lead to rolling. Combined, these elements will give greater insight into the control process, provide an alternative to the existing physics simulations and offer a greater degree of robustness to bridge the gap between simulation and hardware.",

        "abstract": "This paper proposes a new robust position control method for a novel series elastic actuator (SEA). It is a wellknown fact that SEAs provide many benefits in force control, e.g., lower reflected inertia and impedance, greater shock tolerance, safety, and so on. However, current SEA designs have a common performance limitation due to the compromise on the selection of spring stiffness. The performance of an SEA can be significantly improved by changing the stiffness of the spring; however, designing a variable-stiffness SEA is a quite challenging task. In this paper, a novel variable-stiffness SEA, which can relax the fundamental performance limitation of conventional SEAs, is proposed. It consists of torsional and linear springs, which have different compliances, in series. The soft and hard springs improve the performance when low and high force control applications are performed, respectively. Although SEAs have several advantages in force control, their position control problem is more complicated than the force control one. Moreover, using extra springs increases the number of vibration mode, which may significantly deteriorate the performance, in the position control problem of the SEA. In this paper, a new position control system, which improves the performance by increasing the robustness and suppressing the vibration, is proposed for a novel SEA. Experimental results are given to validate the proposal.",

Developing such systems require tactile sensors that have enough sensitivity and spatial resolution, and the computational intelligence to meaningfully interpret sensor data. This paper introduces a texture classification algorithm utilizing support vector machine (SVM) classifier. Data taken from a novel three axis tactile sensor that utilize magnetic flux measurements for transduction was used to obtain the three dimensional tactile data. Frobenius norm calculated from the covariance matrix of the above data and the mean values of the three dimensional sensor data were used as features. Palpation velocity and small vertical load variances had minimum influence on the proposed algorithm. We have compared this algorithm with two other classification methods. They are: classify using the feature spatial period that is calculated from principal frequencies of the textures/material, and classify using neural network classifier with special properties of each material's tactile signals as features. For eight classes of material, the proposed algorithm performed faster and more accurately than the comparators when the scanning velocity and the vertical load varied.",

We frame this as a selection problem where the goal is to choose the most robust trajectory from a finite set of candidates. We generate each candidate using a kinodynamic state space planner and evaluate it using noisy rollouts. Our key insight is we can formalize the selection problem as the \u201cbest arm\u201d variant of the multi-armed bandit problem. We use the successive rejects algorithm to efficiently allocate rollouts between candidate trajectories given a rollout budget. We show that the successive rejects algorithm identifies the best candidate using fewer rollouts than a baseline algorithm in simulation. We also show that selecting a good candidate increases the likelihood of successful execution on a real robot.",

        "abstract": "This paper presents a novel control method to stabilize the whole-body motion of humanoid robots when climbing vertical ladders and transitioning between ladders and catwalks. In such environments, the body of the robot tends to incline and rotate because of the slippery surfaces. The inclination and rotation may cause the robot to fail to grasp and thus collide with the rungs. The proposed method modifies the subsequent contact position in real time based on the error of the current robot posture estimated with inertial measurement units (IMUs) and actual joint angles. This paper also presents a method of generating motion by minimizing the contact wrench. This method satisfies hardware limitations, such as collision avoidance, joint torque limits, and joint limits. Applying these methods to a humanoid robot, we realize the robust climbing and descending of multiple rungs of a vertical ladder and bidirectional transitioning from ladders to catwalks.",

Given two image sequences, our method first extracts one descriptor per image for both sequences using a deep convolutional neural network. Then, we compute a similarity matrix by comparing each image of a query sequence with a database. Finally, based on the similarity matrix, we formulate a flow network problem and compute matching hypotheses between sequences. In this way, our approach can handle partially matching routes, loops in the trajectory and different speeds of the robot. With a matching hypothesis as loop closure information and the odometry information of the robot, we formulate a graph based SLAM problem and compute a joint maximum likelihood trajectory.",

After detection, the tracking of the multilevel patch features is closely coupled to the underlying extended Kalman filter (EKF) by directly using the intensity errors as innovation term during the update step. We follow a purely robocentric approach where the location of 3D landmarks are always estimated with respect to the current camera pose. Furthermore, we decompose landmark positions into a bearing vector and a distance parametrization whereby we employ a minimal representation of differences on a corresponding \u03c3-Algebra in order to achieve better consistency and to improve the computational performance. Due to the robocentric, inverse-distance landmark parametrization, the framework does not require any initialization procedure, leading to a truly power-up-and-go state estimation system. The presented approach is successfully evaluated in a set of highly dynamic hand-held experiments as well as directly employed in the control loop of a multirotor unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV).",

To make VO robust with respect to illumination conditions, they need to be considered explicitly. In this paper, we propose a direct visual odometry method which can handle illumination changes by considering an affine illumination model to compensate abrupt, local light variations during direct motion estimation process. The core of our proposed method is to estimate the relative camera pose and the parameters of the illumination changes by minimizing the sum of squared photometric error with efficient second-order minimization. We evaluate the performance of the proposed algorithm on synthetic and real RGB-D datasets with ground-truth.

Here we propose a line segment-based RGB-D indoor odometry algorithm robust to lighting variation. We know line segments are abundant indoors and less sensitive to lighting change than point features. However, depth data are often noisy, corrupted or even missing for line segments which are often found on object boundaries where significant depth discontinuities occur. Our algorithm samples depth data along line segments, and uses a random sample consensus approach to identify correct depth and estimate 3D line segments. We analyze 3D line segment uncertainties and estimate camera motion by minimizing the Mahalanobis distance. In experiments we compare our method with two state-of-the-art methods including a keypoint-based approach and a dense visual odometry algorithm, under both constant and varying lighting. Our method demonstrates superior robustness to lighting change by outperforming the competing methods on 6 out of 8 long indoor sequences under varying lighting. Meanwhile our method also achieves improved accuracy even under constant lighting when tested using public data.",

        "abstract": "This paper presents the results of a study on the effect of in-series compliance on the locomotion of a simulated 8-DoF Lola-OP\u2122 Modular Snake Robot with added compliant elements. We explore whether there is an optimal stiffness for gait, terrain type, or several gaits and several terrains (i.e. a good \u201cgeneral-purpose\u201d stiffness). Compliance was simulated using ball joints with eight different levels of stiffness. Two snake locomotion gaits (rolling and sidewinding) were tested over flat ground and three different types of rough terrains. We performed grid search and Particle Swarm Optimization to identify the locomotion parameters leading to fast locomotion and analyzed the best candidates in terms of locomotion speed and energy efficiency (cost of transport). Contrary to our expectations, we did not observe a clear trend that would favor the use of compliant elements over rigid structures. For sidewinding, compliant and stiff elements lead to comparable performances. For rolling gait, the general rule seems to be \u201cthe stiffer, the better\u201d.",

        "abstract": "To build conversational robots, roboticists are required to have deep knowledge of both robotics and spoken dialogue systems. Although they can use existing cloud services that were built for other services, e.g., voice search, it will be difficult to share robotics-specific speech corpora obtained as server logs, because they will get buried in non-robotics-related logs. Building a cloud platform especially for the robotics community will benefit not only individual robot developers but also the robotics community since we can share the log corpus collected by it. This is challenging because we need to build a wide variety of functionalities ranging from a stable cloud platform to high-quality multilingual speech recognition and synthesis engines. In this paper, we propose \u201crospeex,\u201d which is a cloud robotics platform for multilingual spoken dialogues with robots. We analyze the logs we have collected by operating rospeex for more than a year. Our key contribution lies in building a cloud robotics platform and allowing the robotics community to use it without payment or authentication.",

        "abstract": "The Harvard Robobee is a fly-sized aerial vehicle that can perform controlled flight maneuvers. But this robot is unable to control its yaw or heading angle to a desired value. Motivated by this deficiency, we propose a new method to produce yaw-axis rotations. Termed wriggle-steering, it consists of driving body oscillations around its two other rotational axes. Because no torque is applied directly around the controlled axis, it therefore constitutes an alternative control method for under-actuated designs. Oscillations are driven around pitch and roll axes at the same frequency but 90 degrees out of phase, resulting in a small change in yaw angle after each cycle because of nonlinearity in attitude dynamics. We propose two wing kinematics perturbations that produce the necessary actuation. The predictions are validated with a quasi-steady aerodynamics model, free-body simulations, and flight tests on a fly-sized hovering aerial robot. The results suggest that wriggle-steering can save mass and reduce complexity by eliminating the need for additional actuators in flapping-wing robots or other aircraft.",

Since an accurate measurement of the camera own motion may be a non-trivial task in several robotics applications (for instance when the camera is onboard a UAV), we propose in this paper an active SfM scheme fully independent from the camera angular velocity. This is achieved by considering, as visual features, some rotational invariants obtained from the projection of the perceived 3D points onto a virtual unitary sphere (unified camera model). This feature set is then exploited for designing a rotation-free active SfM algorithm able to optimize online the direction of the camera linear velocity for improving the convergence of the structure estimation task. As case study, we apply our framework to the depth estimation of a set of 3D points and discuss several simulations and experimental results for illustrating the approach.",

The work is the first demonstration of energetically autonomy in a microbial fuel cell (MFC)-powered, swimming robot taking energy from it's surrounding, aqueous environment. In contrast to previous work using stacked MFC power sources, the Row-bot employs a single microbial fuel cell as an artificial stomach and uses commercially available voltage step-up hardware to produce usable voltages. The energy generated exceeds the energy requirement to complete the mechanical actuation needed to refuel. Energy production and actuation are demonstrated separately with the results showing that the combination of these subsystems will produce closed-loop energetic autonomy. The work shows a crucial step in the development of autonomous robots capable of long term self-power. Bio-inspiration for the design of the Row-bot was taken from the water boatman beetle. This proof of concept study opens many avenues for the further development of the subsystems comprising the Row-bot, and the functionality of the robot itself.",

        "abstract": "Human running motion can be modeled using a spring-loaded inverted pendulum (SLIP), where the linear-spring-like motion of the standing leg is produced by the joint stiffness of the knee and ankle. To use running speed control in the SLIP model, we should only decide the landing placement of the leg. However, for using running speed control with a multi-joint leg, we should also decide the joint angle and joint stiffness of the standing leg because these affect the direction of the ground reaction force. In this study, we develop a running control method for a human-like multi-joint leg. To achieve a running motion, we developed a running control method including pelvis oscillation control for attaining jumping power with the joint stiffness of the leg and running speed control by changing the landing placement of the leg. For using running speed control, we estimated the ground reaction force using the equation of motion and detected the joint angles of the leg for directing the ground reaction force toward the center of mass. To evaluate the proposed control methods, we compared the estimated ground reaction force with the force measured by the real robot. Moreover, we performed a running experiment with the developed running robot. By using ground reaction force estimation, this robot could accomplish the running motion with pelvic oscillation for attaining jumping power and running speed control.",

        "abstract": "3D Object recognition is one of the big problems in Computer Vision which has a direct impact in Robotics. There have been great advances in the last decade thanks to point cloud descriptors. These descriptors do very well at recognizing object instances in a wide variety of situations. Of great interest is also to know how descriptors perform in object classification tasks. With that idea in mind, we introduce a descriptor designed for the representation of object classes. Our descriptor, named SCurV, exploits 3D shape information and is inspired by recent findings from neurophysiology. We compute and incorporate surface curvatures and distributions of local surface point projections that represent flatness, concavity and convexity in a 3D object-centered and view-dependent descriptor. These different sources of information are combined in a novel and simple, yet effective, way of combining different features to improve classification results which can be extended to the combination of any type of descriptor. Our experimental setup compares SCurV with other recent descriptors on a large classification task. Using a large and heterogeneous database of 3D objects, we perform our experiments both on a classical, flat classification task and within a novel framework for hierarchical classification. On both tasks, the SCurV descriptor outperformed all other 3D descriptors tested.",

        "abstract": "Inspired by biological systems, compliant elements are introduced in the driving train of legged robots with the purpose of recycling energy. This paper presents the design and control concept of the monopedal robot SPEAR, driven by a novel implementation of a Switchable Parallel Elastic Actuator (S-PEA). At the stance phase, the parallel spring in S-PEA works with the actuator to support body weight and recover energy. The spring is removed from the system at the flight phase to gain precise joint control. The stiffness of the whole leg is also adjustable online either by active control of the motor or by changing the knee angle at touchdown. Experimental results show that the spring recycles part of energy during hopping, reducing the peak torque and peak power of the motor.",

In the underwater domain, difficult environmental conditions restrict the applicability of many existing methods for 3D sensing. A new method is proposed, which uses a visible laser line projected onto a monocular camera image to perform 3D scene reconstruction. The method fuses Structured Light with Structure from Motion in an integrated process, which allows for the capturing of dense 3D point clouds on moving systems in situations with low texture and minimal scene structure. The system is evaluated in three experiment scenarios and provides an average translation error of 2% in the KITTI Benchmark for monocular visual odometry and an average model error of 1:7mm when compared with a tabletop structured light system.",

        "abstract": "Micro Aerial Vehicles (MAVs) are becoming ubiquitous, but most experiments and demonstrations have been limited to slow flight except in open environments or in laboratories with motion capture systems. In this paper, we develop representations and algorithms for aggressive flight in cluttered environments. We incorporate the specific dynamics of the system and generate safe, feasible trajectories for fast navigation in real time. Specifically, we use a polyhedral decomposition of the visible free space and address the generation of safe trajectories that are within the space. Because of the limited field of view, we adopt a receding horizon control policy (RHCP) for planning over a finite time horizon, but with the guarantee that there exists a safe stopping control policy over a second time horizon from the planned state at the end of the horizon. Thus, the robot planning occurs over two horizons. While the robot executes the planned trajectory over the first time horizon, the map of obstacles is refreshed allowing the planner to generate a refined plan, once again over two time horizons. The key algorithmic contribution of the paper lies in the fast planning algorithm that is able to incorporate robot dynamics while guaranteeing safety. The algorithm is also optimal in the sense that the receding horizon control policy is based on minimizing the trajectory snap. Central to the algorithm is a novel polyhedral representation that allows us to abstract the trajectory planning problem as a problem of finding a path through a sequence of convex regions in configuration space.",

        "abstract": "Task learning in robotics requires repeatedly executing the same actions in different states to learn the model of the task. However, in real-world domains, there are usually sequences of actions that, if executed, may produce unrecoverable errors (e.g. breaking an object). Robots should avoid repeating such errors when learning, and thus explore the state space in a more intelligent way. This requires identifying dangerous action effects to avoid including such actions in the generated plans, while at the same time enforcing that the learned models are complete enough for the planner not to fall into dead-ends.",

The representative inputs are chosen in safe input sets based on their distance from forbidden input sets. The inputs are not only the safest decisions with respect to various unmodeled sources of uncertainties, but are also representatives of groups of nearby input sets resulting in similar maneuvers. This approach provides an obstacle avoidance strategy for the maximum control margins. For computational efficiency, a sampling-based approach is adopted, and its performance in terms of solution quality and computation time is analyzed. The algorithm has been successfully demonstrated with an example of a car-like robot in fields with obstacles. For the multiple-step horizon problem, a best-first search algorithm is proposed with guarantee of optimality, and its computational efficiency is demonstrated.",

We show no impact on the accuracy of pose estimates of this distributed approach and indeed demonstrate a robustness to delay that improves localisation performance. The bandwidth requirements of our system are much lower than similar systems which enables us to accommodate larger teams of MAVs.

In this paper, we propose a new control scheme for the retrieval of passive space debris after captured by a TSR. Under this control scheme, target can be retrieved rapidly, and both of oscillations of tether and target are converged well. First, we derive the equations of attitude motions for the compound system when the passive target satellite is captured by Tethered Space Robot, where the base satellite (chaser) and the space debris (target) are modeled as rigid bodies and the attachment points of the tether are offset from the centers of mass of the two bodies. Then based on the specifics of equations, we divide the retrieval into two phases, and set a threshold for the retrieval. In different phases, different priorities are presented, and different control schemes are given. Finally, the simulation results are shown to prove that the target satellite could be retrieved rapidly and smoothly in a small oscillation, and the oscillation of tether is totally converged at the end of retrieval.",

We propose a controller that can drive robots in a way that each group composed of robots of a similar type will form clusters while maintaining segregation from other groups. The approach is based on abstractions created to represent each group of robots and an artificial potential function used to segregate the groups. Different from previous works on swarm segregation, we can mathematically guarantee that by using our approach the system will always converge to a state where multiple dissimilar groups are segregated. Moreover, in some situations, our controller does not require all robots to have information about all the other robots in the system. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our controller with simulations with different types of robots and varying number of robots and groups.",

        "abstract": "In order to maintain balance, the motors of an inverted pendulum-style, two-wheeled self-balancing vehicle need to continuously control its wheels. The vehicle is at risk of falling over if any of its motors does not function properly. Some research in this regard has been devoted to gaining redundancy by using more motors geared to a common shaft, but such technique is not effective for a seizing failure. In this paper, we propose a differential redundant mechanism to prevent a seizing failure in such vehicles. This mechanism unifies plural motors using a differential mechanism, and allows redundant motors to operate at different speeds. Therefore, the vehicle can maintain balance even if a motor fails. Furthermore, our mechanism can form a redundant system of two outputs using only three motors. We also propose a controller for this redundant mechanism that does not require changing the control mode when seizing failures occur.",

Previously, we have introduced a method to learn both an action model to execute the skill and a goal model to monitor the execution of the skill. In this paper we show how to use the learned goal models to improve the learned action models autonomously, without further user interaction. Trajectories are sampled from the action model and executed on the robot. The goal model then labels them as success or failure and the successful ones are used to update the action model. We introduce an adaptive sampling method to speed up convergence. We show through both simulation and real robot experiments that our method can fix a failed action model.",

        "abstract": "Human manipulation activity recognition is an important yet challenging task in robot imitation. In this paper, we introduce, for the first time, a novel method for semantic decomposition and recognition of continuous human manipulation activities by using on-line learned individual manipulation models. Solely based on the spatiotemporal interactions between objects and hands in the scene, the proposed framework can parse not only sequential and concurrent (overlapping) manipulation streams but also basic primitive elements of each detected manipulation. Without requiring any prior object knowledge, the framework can furthermore extract object-like scene entities that are performing the same role in the detected manipulations. The framework was evaluated on our new egocentric activity dataset which contains 120 different samples of 8 single atomic manipulations (e.g. Cutting and Stirring) and 20 long and complex activity demonstrations such as \u201cmaking a sandwich\u201d and \u201cpreparing a breakfast\u201d. We finally show that parsed manipulation actions can be imitated by robots even in various scene contexts with novel objects.",

The method is based on sparse, very small patches and incorporates the minimization of photometric error directly into the EKF measurement model so that inertial data and vision-based surface measurements are used simultaneously during camera pose estimation. We fuse vision-based and inertial measurements almost at the raw-sensor level, allowing the estimated system state to constrain and guide image-space measurements. Our formulation allows for an efficient implementation that runs in real-time on a standard CPU and has several appealing and unique characteristics such as being robust to fast camera motion, in particular rotation, and not depending on the presence of corner-like features in the scene. We experimentally demonstrate robust and accurate performance compared to ground truth and show that our method works on scenes containing only non-intersecting lines.",

Our method addresses two important aims: first it reduces the required amount of interaction with a human supervisor, which increases the level of autonomy of the learning process. And second, it has the capability to update its internal representation online with every new observed data sample, which makes it adaptive to new environments. The proposed method is based on a combination of two established methods, namely Online Star Clustering and Label Propagation, but it extends and modifies these in such a way that significant shortcomings such as classification inaccuracy and run time inefficiency can be resolved. In experiments on large benchmark data sets, we show that our approach can quickly learn to classify 3D objects with a significantly reduced amount of required ground truth labels for training.",

It is accepted that fish can use the lateral line to sense states of its neighbours in schooling behaviors. In this study, we investigate how a focal robotic fish senses the states of its swimming neighbour by using its onboard artificial lateral line system for the first time. Dye flow visualization is used to characterize the large-scale structures of the wake behind a swimming robotic fish. In the experiment, the Reverse Karman Vortex Street generated by the anterior robotic fish was sensed by the artificial lateral line of the focal robot. The results show that the robot's artificial lateral line can detect the beating frequency of its neighbouring robot and the distance between the robots. It is promising that artificial lateral line sensing could become one of the most popular close interaction methods for a group of underwater robots in the near future.",

However, existing methods for collision detection include the usage of skin sensors or joint torque sensors, and cannot be applied to robots without these sensors such as industrial manipulators. In this study we propose a sensorless collision detection method. The proposed method detects the collision between robots and humans by identifying the external torques applied to the robot. Without using extra sensors, we observed the joint friction model and motor current. We have formulated the friction model for the robot by using the dynamics of the robot and the observer based on the generalized momentum. In addition, formulation of the friction model and the identification scheme did not include any use of extra sensors. The performance of the proposed collision detection method was evaluated using a 7 DOF manipulator. The experimental results show that collision can be reliably detected without any extra sensors for any type of robot arm.",

To enable the use of robots also when the products change rapidly, the programming must be quick and easy to perform. One way to accomplish this is to use lead-through programming, i.e., the user manually guides the robot. This paper presents a sensorless approach, and thus avoids the need for a typically expensive sensor. The method is based on disabling low-level joint controllers combined with gravity compensation. It is reported how the performance can be improved by compensating for friction. Further, a method for detecting small external torques is described, based on the use of the low-level joint controllers with increased integral gain. The lead-through programming is experimentally evaluated using two different industrial robots.",

        "abstract": "This paper introduces a novel way to improve the settling time of transitions between different walking controllers. This improvement is achieved by commanding a sequence of intermediate transitions to the target controller. As a result, the state of the system enters the domain of attraction of the target controller closer to the fixed point of the Poincar\u00e9 Map. The method is applicable to any walking robot with one degree of underactuation. The problem is expressed as a Markov Decision Process and then solved with Reinforcement Learning. In order to simplify the stability analysis of underactuated walking the Hybrid Zero Dynamics framework is utilized. Another advantage of using the Hybrid Zero Dynamics is the dimensionality reduction of the state representation in the Markov Decision Process. The experimental results suggest that the proposed methodology performs better than a one-step transition for 84.34% of all the considered transitions for a simulated walking robot matching the parameters of RABBIT [1].",

Using the proposed method, the human operator only needs to consider the motion of the end-effector of the manipulator, while the manipulator will avoid obstacle by itself without sacrificing the end effector motion performance. An improved obstacle avoidance strategy based on the joint space redundancy of the manipulator is designed. A dimension reduction method is presented to solve the over defined problem of avoiding velocity to achieve a more efficient use of the redundancy. By employment of an artificial parallel system of the teleoperate manipulator and the task switching weighting factor, the proposed control method enable the robot restoring back to the commanded pose smoothly when the obstacle is removed. By implementing the dimension reduction method, the trajectory of each joint of the manipulator can be controlled at the same time to achieve the restoring task. Thus, the proposed control method can eliminate the impact of the obstacle on the remaining task. Satisfactory experiment results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed methods.",

        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "In situations where humanoid robots with constrained posture walk through a narrow space (e.g. manufacturing plants and kitchens), shuffling motions that are stepless and possess wide foot supporting area are effective. One of the difficulties of humanoid's shuffle translations is the load distribution between both feet. If sole loads are not distributed appropriately, the humanoid robot cannot maintain target contact states of each foot, and it will result in slipping both feet or falling down. In this paper, we propose Slide Friction Control (S.F.C.): offline pattern generator and Slide Contact Stabilizer (S.C.S.): online controller. First, Slide Friction Control determines reference foot forces and COM trajectories by adjusting sole loads and considering kinematic friction. The appropriate load distribution of S.F.C. enables humanoid robots to maintain target foot contact states. Second, Slide Contact Stabilizer controls each foot by using damping control to realize reference foot forces determined by S.F.C. S.C.S. enables humanoid robots to slide foot smoothly by suppressing friction vibrations. We also take into consideration the dynamic balance of humanoid robots such as previous waking stabilizers. Finally, we demonstrate that the proposed system enables humanoid robot to slide their feet smoothly using a life-sized humanoid robot, HRP-2.",

        "abstract": "We propose a novel approach for real-time object pose detection and tracking that is highly scalable in terms of the number of objects tracked and the number of cameras observing the scene. Key to this scalability is a high degree of parallelism in the algorithms employed. The method maintains a single 3D simulated model of the scene consisting of multiple objects together with a robot operating on them. This allows for rapid synthesis of appearance, depth, and occlusion information from each camera viewpoint. This information is used both for updating the pose estimates and for extracting the low-level visual cues. The visual cues obtained from each camera are efficiently fused back into the single consistent scene representation using a constrained optimization method. The centralized scene representation, together with the reliability measures it enables, simplify the interaction between pose tracking and pose detection across multiple cameras. We demonstrate the robustness of our approach in a realistic manipulation scenario. We publicly release this work as a part of a general ROS software framework for real-time pose estimation, SimTrack, that can be integrated easily for different robotic applications.",

        "abstract": "We investigate the interaction between a pedestrian crowd and a social robot-a relevant human-robot interaction scenario observed in train stations and entrances to public places. We use a popular agent-based social force model to simulate a pedestrian crowd as it passes near a stationary robot. The modelling framework permits analysis of difficult-to-test situations such as high density crowds and the effects of contagion whereby more people are likely to interact with the robot if it is already surrounded by an audience. Accordingly, we augment the modelling framework to account for varying crowd densities, human-robot interaction, and social influence, and inform the parameter values from empirical studies in literature. Our results show that while the rate-of-interaction, defined as the number of agents located within an interacting distance per minute, increases with flow density, the average interaction-time is independent of the same. We find that inducing social influence through contagion does not have a significant effect on the rate at which agents engage with the robot in dense crowd scenarios, and has a marginal effect at low densities. The interaction-time was found to depend on the interaction-speed at which agents engage with the robot. These results indicate that at normally witnessed flow densities crowding near the robot is unlikely to take place, and the effect of robot design choices supersede the effects of social force or contagion.",

This often leads to optimally simulated grasps that fail in a real execution when the forces applied at the chosen contact points cannot resist expected perturbations like the own object weight. This paper presents a method that combines a grasp planner with the computation of grasp forces, which provides contact points and contact forces that take into account joint and torque limits of the robotic hand for fingertip grasps. The planner starts with a given hand pose relative to the object, and uses the concept of reachable independent contact regions to obtain a set of force closure grasps. Within this set, the grasp that best counteracts a given external wrench is chosen. The evaluation examples illustrate how the capabilities of the robotic hand can be used more effectively by this joint planning approach.",

        "abstract": "In this paper, an approach for sound source localisation and calibration of an asynchronous microphone array is proposed to be solved simultaneously. A graph-based Simultaneous Localisation and Mapping (SLAM) method is used for this purpose. Traditional sound source localisation using a microphone array has two main requirements. Firstly, geometrical information of microphone array is needed. Secondly, a multichannel analog-to-digital converter is required to obtain synchronous readings of the audio signal. Recent works aim at releasing these two requirements by estimating the time offset between each pair of microphones. However, it was assumed that the clock timing in each microphone sound card is exactly the same, which requires the clocks in the sound cards to be identically manufactured. A methodology is hereby proposed to calibrate an asynchronous microphone array using a graph-based optimisation method borrowed from the SLAM literature, effectively estimating the array geometry, time offset and clock difference/drift rate of each microphone together with the sound source locations. Simulation and experimental results are presented, which prove the effectiveness of the proposed methodology in achieving accurate estimates of the microphone array characteristics needed to be used on realistic settings with asynchronous sound devices.",

        "abstract": "The authors have developed an autonomous loading system for a wheel loader. In this paper, an algorithm is proposed to decide on both an optimized unloading point and several paths between the unloading point and several scooping points. The optimal unloading point that minimizes the total length of those paths has been obtained by using a three-dimensional configuration score space. In the configuration score space, the length of the route from origin to each grid is represented as score number, and a grid shows a position(x,y) and posture(\u03b8). This method was evaluated through simulations and by experiments using a miniature wheel loader robot.",

        "abstract": "Given an articulated rigid body, we define the problem of estimating its dynamics as the problem of computing all the forces and accelerations acting on the bodies which constitute the articulated system. Similarly, we define the state estimation problem as the problem of computing the system positions and velocities. In the present paper we propose a framework for simultaneous state and dynamics estimation. The estimation is framed in a Bayesian framework and a suitable Bayesian prior is defined to guarantee the physical consistency of the obtained estimation. The Bayesian posterior makes use of all available measurements which include encoders, gyroscopes, accelerometers, force and torque sensors. The proposed theoretical framework is validated both on simulation and on the iCub humanoid. The software that implements the theoretical framework is realised with an open-source license.",

        "abstract": "Robotic applications in human environments are usually implemented using a cognitive architecture that integrates techniques of different levels of abstraction, ranging from artificial intelligence techniques for making decisions at a symbolic level to robotic techniques for grounding symbolic actions. In this work we address the problem of simultaneous learning at different levels of abstractions in such an architecture. This problem is important since human environments are highly variable, and many unexpected situations may arise during the execution of a task. The usual approach under this circumstance is to train each level individually to learn how to deal with the new situations. However, this approach is limited since it implies long task interruptions every time a new situation needs to be learned. We propose an architecture where learning takes place simultaneously at all the levels of abstraction. To achieve this, we devise a method that permits higher levels to guide the learning at the levels below for the correct execution of the task. The architecture is instantiated with a logic-based planner and an online planning operator learner, at the highest level, and with online reinforcement learning units that learn action policies for the grounding of the symbolic actions, at the lowest one. A human teacher is involved in the decision-making loop to facilitate learning. The framework is tested in a physically realistic simulation of the Sokoban game.",

        "abstract": "In this paper, linear regression models will be used to decode individual joint angles from low frequency EEG components. To that end, isotonic flexion/extension knee movements will be analyzed. Particularly, the decoding performance of healthy and incomplete spinal cord injured subjects will be assessed to determine the behavior of this methodology with motor disabled people. When studying cortical activity during walking, the appearance of muscular artifacts severely influences the EEG signals recorded. The analysis of single joint movements should decrease the noise provoked by the gait process itself. Additionally, different time windows prior to the decoded angle will be assessed to obtain a more reliable decoder. The results show that decoding performance is significantly above chance for most of the subjects (both healthy and disabled) and suggests that meaningful information of the movement planning starts around 2.5 seconds prior to the decoded angle.",

        "abstract": "Recently, many studies have been conducted on soft in-pipe robots, which are expected to work in pipes where ordinary rigid robots cannot work. In this paper, we present a new soft in-pipe locomotive device that consists of six braided tubes. The tubes of the device are inflated by pneumatic power whose inflation drives the device. This device can travel forward and backward and can rotate in both directions in pipes with various diameters with periodic pressurization of the six tubes. We have developed bundled-tube locomotive devices where each device consists of three tubes in which the devices can travel in pipes of various diameters without blocking the flow in the pipes. However these devices cannot control the their rotation in a pipe. Therefore, we developed the new bundled-tube locomotive device that can control the rotation in a pipe. This new device is a braid with six tubes that include a right-hand helix and a left-hand helix with three tubes each. The developed braided device can achieve various motions based on the pressurization patterns in each of the six tubes. In this paper, we thoroughly explain the relationship between the motions of the device and the pressurization pattern. We also present the locomotion experiment within a pipe with a variable-diameter part and a part that bends in an elbow shape.",

Robotic-assisted medical procedures with medical doctor, patient and medical assistants interacting with a robotic platform can be seen as a paradigmatic example of the coexistence between system autonomy and human action in medicine. However, this can involve unpredicted and dangerous contacts between robotic structures and humans, contacts that have to be managed with appropriate safety strategies, often embedding specific sensitive components into the robot itself. In this paper, a smart sensorized polymeric skin based on textile multi-touch piezoresistive sensors, able to sense and safely manage pressure exerted during a collision with the surrounding environment (e.g., humans), has been designed, fabricated, integrated on a robotic manipulator and tested. The proposed system shows promising results in managing the pressure exerted during the collision, with a close correlation with the analytical analysis (difference lower than 5.6 kPa - error of 9%).",

The low mass and small form factor make them particularly well suited for autonomous flight with small flying robots, especially in GPS-denied environments. In this work, we present the first fully autonomous smartphone-based quadrotor. All the computation, sensing and control runs on an off-the-shelf smartphone, with all the software functionality in a smartphone app.We show how quadrotors can be stabilized and controlled to achieve autonomous flight in indoor buildings with application to smart homes, search and rescue, construction and architecture.

        "abstract": "Percutaneous intervention is a commonly used surgical procedure for many diagnostic and therapeutic operations. Target motion in soft tissue during an intervention caused by tissue deformation is a common problem, along with needle displacement. In this work, we present a deformation planner that generates continuous curvature paths with a bounded curvature derivative that can be used on-line to reach a moving target. This planner is computationally inexpensive and can be used for any robotic system, which has finite angular velocity, to reach a mobile target. The deformation planner, is integrated into a needle steering system using a novel, biologically inspired needle, STING, to track a simulated moving target. In-vitro results in gelatin demonstrate accurate 2D tracking of a moving target (mean 0.27 mm end positional error and 0.80\u00b0 approach angle error) over 3 target movement rates.",

This for instance ensures the continuity of the motor torques of robotic manipulator. Yet no satisfactory solution to this problem has been presented. This paper presents a solution using a B-spline parameterization of rotations. The method allows for a continuous interpolation and approximation through a given set of quaternions up to a specified order. The algorithm resembles the well-known B-spline interpolation in the sense that it boils down to solving a system of linear equations. The method is demonstrated for a polishing application (car fender) with an industrial robot.",

This problem arises when an autonomous vehicle traverses between prescribed boundaries such as corridors, tunnels, channels, etc. Passage boundaries with curvature and heading discontinuities pose challenges for generating smooth paths passing through them. Continuous curvature half-S shaped paths derived from the Four Parameter Logistic Curve family are proposed as a prospective path planning solution. Analytic conditions are derived for generating continuous curvature paths confined within the passage boundaries. Zero end curvature highlights the scalability of the proposed solution and its compatibility with other path planners in terms of larger path planning domains. Various scenarios with curvature and heading discontinuities are considered presenting viability of the proposed solution.",

Sensing human activity, adapting to highly dynamic environments, and acting coherently and contingently is challenging when robots transition from structured environments to human-centric ones. We approach this problem by employing context-based perception, a biologically-inspired, low-cost approach to sensing that leverages noisy, global features. Across several months, our mobile robot collected real-world, multimodal data from multi-use locations; where the same space might be used for many different activities. We then ran a series of unimodal and multimodal classification experiments. We successfully classified several aspects of situational context from noisy data, and, to our knowledge are the first group to do so. This work represents an important step toward enabling robots that can readily leverage context to solve perceptual tasks.",

        "abstract": "The soft pneumatic actuators (SPAs) are a solution toward the highly customizable and light actuators with the versatility of actuation modes, and an inherent compliance. Such flexibility allows SPAs to be considered as alternative actuators for wearable rehabilitative devices and search and rescue robots. The actuator material and air-chamber design dictate the actuator's mechanical performance. Therefore, each actuator design with a single pressure source produces a highly customized motion but only a single degree of freedom (DoF). We present a novel design and fabrication method for a SPA with different modes of actuation using integrated adjustable stiffness layers (ASLs). Unlike the most SPA designs where one independent chamber is needed for each mode of actuation, here we have a single chamber that drives three different modes of actuation by activating different combinations of ASLs. Adapting customized micro heaters and thermistors for modulating the temperature and stiffness of ASLs, we considerably broaden the work space of the SPA actuator. Here, a thorough characterization of the materials and the modeling of the actuator are presented. We propose a design methodology for developing application specific actuators with multi-DoFs that are light and compact.",

        "abstract": "We have developed a forceps-type tactile sensor for palpation of a tumor in laparoscopic surgery. The sensor responds to contact position and force at deformable cavity in the sensor probe by using acoustic reflection. The sensor has high applicability for laparoscopic surgery because of its simple structure and disuse of electrical elements within inserted part into patient's body. In this study, we try to measure softness of a contact tissue by using the sensor. Human can estimate softness from contact area and force. Indentation depth is not always required for softness perception. This perception mechanism suggests that our sensor has a possibility for softness measurement because the sensor can respond to contact position and force. Softness measurement contributes to tumor localization and improvement of diseases database. First, the sensor output characteristic is investigated for different soft samples. Then, a method of stiffness measurement using the sensor outputs is proposed. Experimental results show that the sensor has the capability of softness measurement without any additional sensors.",

Built upon the sensor-based control framework, this approach relies on implicit sound source direction obtained from the time difference of arrival (TDOA). We introduce an analytical modelling of auditory cues considering a robot equipped with a pair of microphones and multiple sound sources, from which a control scheme is designed. A stability analysis is provided as well. The results obtained in simulation show the feasibility and the suitability of this method even in reverberant area.",

This combination eliminates the need for odometric information originating from the robot's motor controller, enabling applications where that information is difficult to obtain, e.g. many electric wheelchairs. The proposed method exploits the programmable spatial sampling capabilities of the 3D sonar system to derive from the same set of received echo signals both an accurate representation of reflectors in the horizontal plane (2D energyscape) and a more coarse representation of reflectors in the frontal hemisphere (3D energyyscape). Using a mapping experiment we demonstrate that the motion estimates originating from the acoustic flow module combined with the coarse frontal hemisphere data provide sufficient information for the mapping module to reconstruct the robot's trajectory.",

We also proposed a method for estimating the face orientation of the detected speakers. The developed system was evaluated in two steps: individual utterances in different positions and orientations; and simultaneous dialogues by multiple speakers. Evaluation results revealed that the proposed system could detect speech activity intervals with more than 90% of accuracy, and face orientations with standard deviations within 30 degrees, in situations excluding the cases where all arrays are in the opposite direction to the speaker's face orientation.",

        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "Robots made from soft materials have recently captured the interest of researchers from a range of fields including engineers, material scientists, and chemists, biologists, and computer scientists. This new paradigm of soft robotics aims to develop more adaptable, more capable and safer robots that can interact with unstructured environments or permit close cooperation with humans. Current, commercially-available solutions in industrial robotics tend to take a software-centered approach to safe human-robot interaction or focus on the design of lightweight structures consisting of conventional rigid materials. Even though these solutions provide a higher safety level than traditional industrial robots, robots that comprise a sufficiently large amount of soft structures will bring about a certain degree of inherent safety. One of the major challenges in today's soft robotics research is to design robots that are inherently safe and adaptable but are also capable of bearing limited loads. Nature has solved this predicament in larger animals by incorporating stiff endoskeletons, which support the weight of the otherwise predominantly soft bodies. This insight has led to the development of a novel spine-like manipulator (SpineMan) comprised of rigid elements made from polypropylene and soft elements consisting of polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) borax hydrogels that are enveloped in a silicone skin. The initial design, material selection, synthesis, and characterization of this robot are presented in this article.",

        "abstract": "Fractional order calculus is a generalization of the familiar integer order calculus in that, it allows for differentiation/integration with orders of any real number. The use of fractional order calculus in systems and control applications provides the user an extra design variable, the order of differointegration, which can be tuned to improve the desired behavior of the overall system. We propose utilization of fractional order models/controllers in haptic systems and study the effect of fractional differentiation order on the stability robustness of the overall sampled-data system. Our results demonstrate that fractional calculus generalization has a significant impact on both the shape and area of stability region of a haptic system and inclusion of fractional order impedances may improve the stability robustness of haptic rendering. Our results also include experimental verification of the stability regions predicted by the theoretical analysis.",

        "abstract": "During grasping and other in-hand manipulation tasks maintaining a stable grip on the object is crucial for the task's outcome. Inherently connected to grip stability is the concept of slip. Slip occurs when the contact between the fingertip and the object is partially lost, resulting in sudden undesired changes to the objects state. While several approaches for slip detection have been proposed in the literature, they frequently rely on previous knowledge of the manipulated object. This previous knowledge may be unavailable, seeing that robots operating in real-world scenarios often must interact with previously unseen objects. In our work we explore the generalization capabilities of well known supervised learning methods, using random forest classifiers to create generalizable slip predictors. We utilize these classifiers in the feedback loop of an object stabilization controller. We show that the controller can successfully stabilize previously unknown objects by predicting and counteracting slip events.",

        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "The concept of navigating groups of magnetically propelled particles through the fluid-filled passageways of the body provides the potential to perform highly localized diagnostic and therapeutic procedures. The use of MRI scanners to both navigate and propel millimeter-scale robots has received recent attention. MRI-based motion planning and control laws have been proposed that can achieve independent position control of multiple robots despite the system being underactuated, i.e., the same magnetic gradients are experienced by all the robots. To date, however, these analyses have neglected the magnetic interaction forces and torques between these robots. Thus, the question of whether or not the relatively weak gradients can stabilize the particles as they approach each other has remained open. This paper investigates this question by analyzing interaction forces and torques experienced inside an MRI scanner. It is shown that interaction torques can be neglected in the presence of the strong central field of the scanner. Using the reduced force-based model, a lower bound on separation distance is derived and it is shown that this bound could be achieved if the system was fully actuated. Considering underactuation, simulation demonstrates that Model Predictive Control can stabilize pairs of robots at separation distances 2.5-3 times the lower bound on separation distance.",

        "abstract": "Passivity has been the most often used constraint for the controller design of bilateral teleoperation systems. However passivity has been suffering from its own design conservatism since this is a sufficient condition for stability and representing only a small set of overall stability region. In our previous works [1], [2], a less conservatism control approach, we named it Input-to-Sate Stable (ISS) approach, has been introduced for reducing the intrinsic design conservatism of the passivity-based controllers by allowing bigger output energy compared with the passivity-based controller while guaranteeing the stability. However the previous works were limited to haptic interfaces, which is interacting with computer generated virtual environments. In this paper, we extended the ISS approach for bilateral teleoperation systems. For this extension, the previous one-port ISS approach was generalized to two-port ISS approach. The main difficulty of this extension was identifying the signal pair to show hysteresis nonlinear behavior. By introducing a linear function assumption for two-port bilateral controller, which is generally acceptable, we could formulate two-port ISS approach. The extended two-port approach was implemented to a position-force bilateral teleoperation system, and the performance was experimentally verified with a dual Phantom teleoperation system.",

This work extends the functionality of this robot to ascend and descend stairs of dimensions that are also typical of an urban setting. Stair Climbing is realized by equipping the robot's link joints with optimally designed passive spring pairs that resist clockwise and counter clockwise moments generated by the ground during the climbing motion. This 3-module robot is only propelled by wheel actuators. Desirable stair climbing configurations are estimated a-priori and used to obtain the optimal stiffness for springs. Extensive numerical simulation results over different stair configurations are shown. The numerical simulations are corroborated by experimentation using the prototype and its performance is tabulated for different types of surfaces.",

On the other hand, they have a poor wheel traction and suffer from vertical and horizontal vibration, decreasing the trajectory following accuracy of the robot. In this study, we address this problem by integrating an orientation estimation and correction algorithm in the Omniclimber control by integration of an accelerometer. Moreover, since the Omniclimber chassis adapts to curved structures, the kinematics of the robot change when moving on a curved surface. We integrated an additional algorithm which corrects the robot's kinematics based on the curvature diameter and the current robot orientation. By integrating these two algorithms we could make remarkable improvements on the path following accuracy of the Omniclimber on flat and curved structures.",

The methodology focuses on providing reliable full pose state estimation for a commercially-available hexapod robot platform with the use of only commonly-available sensors. The presented methodology provides the derivation of the kinematic model and implements an Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) state estimation framework similar to that recently validated on a quadruped. The EKF fuses the kinematic model with on-board IMU measurements to estimate the pose of the robot. The methodology was tested with experiments using a physical hexapod robot and validated with independent ground truth measurements.",

In order to compensate for disturbances and model errors we extend the model by a state for the external force and an additional input which is calculated from the dynamics error in pattern generation. Several simulation results underline the effectiveness of the proposed filter and show its robustness against disturbances. Experimental results and an application example validate the method under real world conditions.",

        "abstract": "There are a few types of step-climbing wheelchairs in the world, but most of them are large and heavy because they are power-assisted. Therefore, they require large space to maneuver, which is not always feasible with existing house architectures. This study proposes a novel step-climbing wheelchair based on lever propulsion control using human upper limbs. The developed step-climbing wheelchair device consists of manual wheels with casters for moving around and a rotary-legs mechanism that is capable of climbing steps. The wheelchair also has a passive mechanism for posture transition to shift the center of gravity of the person between the desired positions for planar locomotion and step-climbing. The proposed design consists of passive parts, and this leads the wheelchair being compact and lightweight. In this paper, we present the design of this step-climbing wheelchair and some preliminary experiments to test its usability.",

To achieve this, it heavily exploits the parallel nature of the SLAM problem, separating the time-constrained pose estimation from less pressing matters such as map building and refinement tasks. On the other hand, the stereo setting allows to reconstruct a metric 3D map for each frame of stereo images, improving the accuracy of the mapping process with respect to monocular SLAM and avoiding the well-known bootstrapping problem. Also, the real scale of the environment is an essential feature for robots which have to interact with their surrounding workspace. A series of experiments, on-line on a robot as well as off-line with public datasets, are performed to validate the accuracy and real-time performance of the developed method.",

Since, in the case of teleoperated assembly, an operator is the main source of errors, there is a great interest in microassembly automation. Its main issue consists in precise estimation of object position. Previous studies demonstrate the possibility of application of modelbased visual tracking algorithms from ViSP (Visual Servoing Platform) library. However, the methods of macroassembly cannot be directly applied when working with microobjects. The characterization of single-view visual tracking notably revealed the complexity of depth estimation in microscale, which is due to small depth variation in the seen images compared with the distance from camera. So, an algorithm of Z coordinate reconstruction using a second camera was developed and analyzed for visual servoing task. It was then used to automate microassembly. Experiments demonstrate the possibility of complex microcomponent automatic microassembly with precision better than 10 micrometers.",

There are many motion planning problems, including flight coordination and autonomous vehicles, that require an algorithm to predict obstacle motion and plan safely. In this paper, we propose Stochastic Ensemble Simulation (SES)-based planning, a novel framework to efficiently predict and produce safe trajectories in the presence of stochastic obstacles. The stochastic obstacles can be introduced in several ways including stochastic motion or position/speed uncertainty. SES-based planning works by first predicting an obstacle's future position offline through an ensemble of Monte Carlo simulations. These runs simulate the stochastic obstacle dynamics and store the simulation results in temporal snapshots of predicted positions. An online planner then uses this output to identify a predicted collision-free direct path to the goal. If the direct path is not expected to be collision-free, a more expensive tree-based planner is used. Our experiments show SES-based planning outperforms other methods that have high planning success in environments with 900 stochastically moving obstacles. Furthermore, our method plans trajectories with an 80% success rate for a 7 DOF robot in an environment with 250 stochastic moving obstacles and 50 obstacles with speed/position uncertainty. This complex problem is currently beyond the capability of several comparison methods.",

        "abstract": "This paper presents a stochastic approach for automatic collision avoidance for tele-operated unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). Collision detection and mitigation in the presence of uncertainty is an important problem to address because on-board sensing and state estimation uncertainties are inherent in real-world systems. A feedforward-based algorithm is described that continually extrapolates the future trajectory of the vehicle given the current operator control input for collision avoidance. If the predicted probability of a collision is greater than a user-defined confidence bound, the algorithm overrides the operator control input with the nearest, safe command signal to steer the robot away from obstacles, while maintaining user intent. The algorithm is implemented on a simulated quadrotor helicopter (quadcopter) with varying amounts of artificial uncertainty. Simulation results show that for a given confidence bound, the aerial robot is able to avoid collisions, even in a situation where the operator is deliberately attempting to crash the vehicle.",

Instead, micro- and nanorobots are often controlled by a global field. In previous work we conducted large-scale human-user experiments where humans played games that steered large swarms of simple robots to complete tasks such as manipulating blocks. One surprising result was that humans completed a block-pushing task faster when provided with only the mean and variance of the robot swarm than with full-state feedback. Inspired by human operators, this paper investigates controllers that use only the mean and variance of a robot swarm. We prove that the mean position is controllable, and show how an obstacle can make the variance controllable. We next derive automatic controllers for these and a hybrid, hysteresis-based switching control to regulate the first two moments of the robot distribution. Finally, we employ these controllers as primitives for a block-pushing task.",

This paper proposes a new wheel mechanism, the swing-grouser wheel, which can climb high steps (especially in low friction environments) and has high energy efficiency. In addition, the swing-grouser wheel can climb regardless of the body inclination. Its merits are compared to the results of prior studies. Furthermore, the performance of the swing-grouser wheel was confirmed using a real device experiment and a 2D physics simulation, and improved using a full search of the parameters of the swing-grouser wheel. As a result, one improved parameter resulted in climbing at over 68% of the wheel diameter in a low friction environment; additionally, the energy efficiency was better than that of the previous model.",

Then, the relationships between the motion performance and the gait patterns are identified based on two force constraints hypothesises. To validate theoretical analysis of kinematic model and prediction of average velocity, the experiments are conducted on a novel snake-like robot prototype. Each module of the robot contains unique one-direction wheels, which generate sufficient backward friction force severing as anchoring force.",

        "abstract": "Autonomous robots operating in semi- or unstructured environments, e.g. during search and rescue missions, require methods for online on-board creation of maps to support path planning and obstacle avoidance. Perception based on stereo cameras is well suited for mixed indoor/outdoor environments. The creation of full 3D maps in GPS-denied areas however is still a challenging task for current robot systems, in particular due to depth errors resulting from stereo reconstruction. State-of-the-art 6D SLAM approaches employ graph-based optimization on the relative transformations between keyframes or local submaps. To achieve loop closures, correct data association is crucial, in particular for sensor input received at different points in time. In order to approach this challenge, we propose a novel method for submap matching. It is based on robust keypoints, which we derive from local obstacle classification. By describing geometrical 3D features, we achieve invariance to changing viewpoints and varying light conditions. We performed experiments in indoor, outdoor and mixed environments. In all three scenarios we achieved a final 3D position error of less than 0.23% of the full trajectory. In addition, we compared our approach with a 3D RBPF SLAM from previous work, achieving an improvement of at least 27% in mean 2D localization accuracy in different scenarios.",

        "abstract": "Although superresolution has been studied to huge impact in visual imaging, it is relatively unexplored in tactile robotics. Here we demonstrate a novel optical sensor design (the TacTip) capable of achieving 40-fold localization superresolution to 0.1mm accuracy compared with a 4mm resolution between tactile elements. This superresolution is reached for localizing a 40mm diameter hemicylinder with a tactile finger pad also of 40mm diameter. Deformations of the sensor surface are measured as displacements of molded internal pins, with pin separation thus defining sensor resolution. Active Bayesian perception for classifying object location was used to ensure robust localization and hence the magnitude of the superresolution. These results are comparable with those for capacitive tactile sensors, which we interpret as originating from a convergence in the taxel-based design of the optical sensor and capacitive tactile sensors. The attained superresolution is comparable to the best perceptual hyperacuity in humans.",

        "abstract": "We present a light, actuated smart staff with 5DOF tip force sensing which can be used by a humanoid robot operating in challenging terrain. The staff has an extension mechanism that employs mechanical multiplexing to achieve a high extension ratio in a stiff and compact package. The tip force sensor uses two metal diaphragms to achieve decoupling of axial and radial forces and the ability to tune the maximum range of forces in each direction independently. With the force sensor, the robot can characterize the coefficient of friction and orientation of a surface with simple motion primitives. Two sets of experiments were conducted with the smart staff manipulated by a 7 DOF robot arm. Using the sensor, the robot was able to determine the orientations of sloped surfaces within two degrees in two orthogonal directions.",

        "abstract": "The aim of this research is to develop a musculoskeletal robot arm, which has a similar mechanical structure to that of a human, to simply make the robot move similarly to a human based on his/her electromyographic signals. In recent years, many musculoskeletal robots have been developed to show advantages of their bio-inspired designs. In this research, we propose a new perspective of their advantages that the control using biological signals can be simplified thanks to the similarity of mechanical structure. To this end, the shoulder complex, which consists of several bones and joints, is focused because it is the most difficult part to develop in humanlike musculoskeletal robot arms. In particular, we develop a linkage mechanism, which can realize similar function to the shoulder complex, to make a surface electromyography(sEMG) based posture control applicable for this complex system. The advantage, that a simple mapping is still available to control the posture to be the same to that of a human, has been successfully shown in an experiment.",

        "abstract": "We address the problem of robust instance detection in RGB-D image in the presence of noisy data, cluttering, partial occlusion and large pose variation. We extract contour points from the depth image, construct a Surface Oriented Traverse (SOT) feature for each contour point and further classify it as either belonging or not belonging to the instance of interest. Starting from each contour point, its SOT feature is constructed by traversing and uniformly sampling along an oriented geodesic path on the object surface. After classification, all contour points vote for an instance-specific saliency map, from which the instance of interest is finally localized. Compared with the holistic template-based and learning-based methods, our method inherits advantages of the feature-based methods in dealing with cluttering, partial occlusion, and large pose variation. Furthermore, our method does not require accurate 3D models or high quality laser scan data as input and takes noisy data from commodity 3D sensors. Experimental results on the public RGB-D Object Dataset and our FindMe RGB-D Dataset demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of our proposed instance detection algorithm.",

The robot is equipped with four omni-directional wheels and the sensor is mounted on its frame to measure the whole body vibration. Four typical indoor floors were tested over four robot motions. Final results show that a mixture of statistical and spectrum density based features are sufficient to identify surfaces with more than 85% overall accuracy.",

In this study, a fluorescent material was used to evaluate the injection positional precision inside the C. elegans. The fluorescent microbead was picked up at the tip of a micropipette injection tool and injected by a piezo actuated microinjector. The distance between the injected micro-gel bead and closest nerve axon was measured as 20.3 \u03bcm and 16.5 \u03bcm by in vivo observation of a confocal microscopy. The two types of pipette tools were used to evaluate the success and survival rates of microinjection, and the smaller pipette (pipette A, 0.8 \u03bcm in diameter) showed higher rates as 50 % and 67 % respectively.",

        "abstract": "The goal of this work is to study the application of switchable magnets (SM) for climbing robots. A switchable magnet is a device which uses moving permanent magnets to change the magnetic flux path and switch on or off the magnetic attraction force. In our work we used Comsol Multiphysics, a physics simulation software in order to simulate the flow of the magnetic flux on switchable magnets on its different states and study the effect of different design and material parameters on the attraction force of the unit. Bearing in mind the lessons learned from this study, we developed a novel device in a smaller scale with the best holding force/mass ratio, for using in climbing robot applications. As a case study, three of these optimized SM units are then equipped with an actuator that can rotate the moving magnets, turning the device on and off. This new device is employed in a novel adaptive adhesion unit for the OmniClimber robot, replacing its previous system which was relying on electromagnets magnets. We demonstrate this novel device application on a climbing robot and the advantages relative to electromagnet or permanent magnet based devices.",

The paper deals with the design, the calibration, and the testing of a specific configuration of this system, where the surface is connected to an array of piezoresistive MEMs silicon 3-axis force sensors. In this configuration, only the contact position and the force components are estimated. The tests have proven that this sensor satisfies most of the characteristics needed to achieve robotic dexterous manipulation.",

Using a combination of formal reasoning and physical intuition, we analyze and test successively more capable leaping behaviors through successively more complicated body mechanics. The final version of this machine studied here bounds up a ledge 1.5 times its hip height and crosses a gap 2 times its body length, exceeding in this last regard the mark set by the far more mature RHex hexapod. Theoretical contributions include a non-existence proof of a useful class of leaps for a stripped-down initial version of the new machine, setting in motion the sequence of improvements leading to the final resulting performance. Conceptual contributions include a growing understanding of the Ground Reaction Complex as an effective abstraction for classifying and generating transitional contact behaviors in robotics.",

This ensures energy efficiency and high jumping velocity and distance. Recently, we have shown in simulation that a simple, biologically inspired bang-bang controller operating in the local coordinate of the first resonant mode leads to limit cycles which are robust with respect to leg model uncertainties and ground properties. In this paper we address the velocity control of the hopping and the planning of the bang-bang control parameters for the case that the systems should not move at steady state velocity, but should have different step lengths and heights. We exploit the discrete structure and the small number of parameters of the controller to develop a fast optimization procedure for generating an arbitrary sequence of steps. This approach can provide high motion performance, robustness and substantial computational time saving compared to continuous trajectory and controller gain planning. The stationary and the aperiodic hopping is validated by experiments on a new planar elastic leg.",

In this paper, two task-dependent grasp quality measures are introduced: task wrench coverage measure and the manipulator efficiency measure. The first one measures the ability of a grasp to provide required interactive wrench during a task, while the second measures the effort that the manipulator takes for the whole manipulation process in facilitating the required instrument motion, which is determined by the grasp when the motion of the instrument is defined. The proposed measures are then used in selecting grasps for three typical manipulation tasks in simulations and using a real robotic system and produced successful grasp synthesis outcomes that satisfy manipulative requirements.",

        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "When a mobile manipulator functions as an assistive device, the robot's initial configuration and the configuration of the environment can impact the robot's ability to provide effective assistance. Selecting initial configurations for assistive tasks can be challenging due to the high number of degrees of freedom of the robot, the environment, and the person, as well as the complexity of the task. In addition, rapid selection of initial conditions can be important, so that the system will be responsive to the user and will not require the user to wait a long time while the robot makes a decision. To address these challenges, we present Task-centric initial Configuration Selection (TCS), which unlike previous work uses a measure of task-centric manipulability to accommodate state estimation error, considers various environmental degrees of freedom, and can find a set of configurations from which a robot can perform a task. TCS performs substantial offline computation, so that it can rapidly provide solutions at run time. At run time, the system performs an optimization over candidate initial configurations using a utility function that can include factors such as movement costs for the robot's mobile base. To evaluate TCS, we created models of 11 activities of daily living (ADLs) and evaluated TCS's performance with these 11 assistive tasks in a computer simulation of a PR2, a robotic bed, and a model of a human body. TCS performed as well or better than a baseline algorithm in all of our tests against state estimation error.",

Based on the relative Jacobian formulation, singularity-robust inverse kinematics and the scheme of null space distributing exceeded joint velocity, this work contributes by introducing a framework to handle multi-tasking conflicts both in task and joint space for dual-arm robots. Detailed validation of the proposed framework is first conducted by using a simulated dual-arm robot, followed by a demonstration on two 7-dof Kuka lightweight manipulators in a bimanual stent graft manufacturing task.",

        "abstract": "We consider the problem of learning from complex sequential demonstrations. We propose to analyze demonstrations in terms of the concurrent interaction phases which arise between pairs of involved bodies (hand-object and object-object). These interaction phases are the key to decompose a full demonstration into its atomic manipulation actions and to extract their respective consequences. In particular, one may assume that the goal of each interaction phase is to achieve specific geometric constraints between objects. This generalizes previous Learning from Demonstration approaches by considering not just the motion of the end-effector but also the relational properties of the objects' motion. We present a linear-chain Conditional Random Field model to detect the pair-wise interaction phases and extract the geometric constraints that are established in the environment, which represent a high-level task oriented description of the demonstrated manipulation. We test our system on single- and multi-agent demonstrations of assembly tasks, respectively of a wooden toolbox and a plastic chair.",

Because this hand is designed specifically for Baxter, we are able to make some important simplifications in the design relative to other 3D printed hands. In particular, the Easyhand is smaller than most other 3D printed hands and it is powered by the native Baxter gripper actuator. As a result, our hand is cheaper, lighter, and easier to interface with than other robot hands available for Baxter. This paper details the design of the hand and its mechanical characteristics and reports results from experiments that characterize its grasping performance.",

        "abstract": "HTN planners have generally relied on specialised languages for domain and problem representations. To facilitate adoption by other communities such as robotics, however, and integration with real world applications written in standard programming languages, we need HTN planners that are based on more familiar concepts from structured programming, and that come ready with features supporting integration. In this paper, we demonstrate how the HATP (Hierarchical Agent-based Task Planner) HTN planner offers such \u201csyntactic sugar\u201d and some of these features. Moreover, since it has a conceptually distinct syntax compared to traditional HTN planners, we also develop a formalism to unambiguously capture HATP's syntax and an important subset of its semantics, which we then use to compare against the formalism of a well understood family of HTN planners and to show that the former is sound. Finally, we demonstrate that despite quite possibly using \u201cheavier\u201d data structures to naturally capture HATP's syntax/semantics, and thereby facilitate extensions to HATP and integration with other applications, the implementation still performs acceptably.",

        "abstract": "If the control authority of a running system is insufficient to reach a target state in a single step, i.e. if deadbeat control is not possible, then a stabilizing controller is faced with the decision on how to plan intermediate steps. In this work, we compare the performance of a simple greedy control policy (that computes deadbeat inputs and simply caps them) with the optimal performance found by an exhaustive search through decision space. The performance criterion used in this study is the basin of attraction: the set of all states from where the target state will be reached in a finite number of steps. Using the planar spring-loaded inverted pendulum (SLIP) as a model for a running robot, we compare the two control schemes and a fully passive behavior. To this end, we extended the passive slip model to include a controllable, yet limited variation of the touchdown angle and of the damping in the leg spring. We quantified the number of steps that it would take for the model to fall or converge from arbitrary initial states. The paper highlights how the passive stabilization, that is inherent to the SLIP model, greatly influences the dynamics of the controlled system. Furthermore, it reveals some new insights into the structure of basins of attractions of SLIP-like running models.",

In this paper, an innovative calibration device is created, as well as the motor controllers, centre control system, hardware and software system. The Least Square method is proposed for data fitting and parameter predicting, which is used to implement precise calibration for pressure and its distribution. The Frequency Spectrum Analysis method is presented by using Fast Fourier Transform to determine different physical properties of objects under certain frequency range and energy distribution. With the analysis of calibration data and results, the contact force and temperature range are obtained in good linearity, meanwhile the method for how to distinguish objects with similar texture features is put forward by using the Frequency Spectrum Analysis. This study provides a set of systematic calibration methods for the humanoid robot fingers, which can be served as an efficient reference to perceive multimodal objects.",

        "abstract": "Origami robots (Robogamis) use architecture to strategically activate different sets and sequence of actuators to achieve large variety of reconfigurable forms. Tribot is a unique mobile origami robot that can simultaneously choose between two modes of locomotion: jumping and crawling. When assembled, Tribot measures 64 \u00d7 34 \u00d7 20 mm3, weighs 4 g, crawls at 17% of its body length per gait cycle and jumps seven times its height repeatedly without needing to be reset. To optimize the practicality of the nominally 2D design, we made two different approaches to build the prototypes. For one of them, we used the \u201ctraditional\u201d, monolithic, layer-by-layer robogami fabrication method and the second, we printed out most parts using a multi-material 3D printer. By showing the performance of two prototypes side-by-side, we show that with the 3D printer, we can minimize the number of functional layers and reduce the fabrication time. The embedded sensors allow Tribot's crawling gait pattern and jumping height to be modulated with a closed loop control. We compare the expected gait step size and displacement to that of the presented prototype while describing the design and control parameters to achieve the experimental results. We also illustrated the preliminary graphical design tool platform developed to optimize the next design iteration of Tribot.",

        "abstract": "The dynamic model of a manipulator described by second-order differential equations suggests that the couplings between its links are strong. Consequently, any control task (position regulation or desired trajectory tracking) is imprecise. Hence, the decoupling of dynamic equations in robotic mechanisms has attracted many researchers in recent years and various solutions have been proposed. This paper deals with a new dynamic decoupling principle, which involves connecting to a serial manipulator a two-link group forming a Scott-Russell mechanism with the initial links of the manipulator. The goal is to simplify the controller design by reducing the effects of complicated manipulator dynamics. The opposite motion of links in the Scott-Russell mechanism combined with optimal redistribution of masses allows the cancellation of the coefficients of nonlinear terms in the manipulator's kinetic and potential energy equations. Then, by using the optimal control design, the dynamic decoupling due to the changing payload is achieved. The proposed approach, which is a symbiosis of mechanical and control solutions, improves the known design concepts permitting the dynamic decoupling of serial manipulators taking into account the changing payload. The suggested design methodology is illustrated by simulations carried out using ADAMS and MATLAB software, which have confirmed the efficiency of the developed approach.",

Along with the pectoral fin, spanwise flexibility plays a major role in the generation of thrust. This paper investigates the effect of spanwise flexibility on propulsion performance using theoretical and experimental studies. For this study, the kinematic model of oscillating pectoral fin is first established based on the mechanism of active/passive flexible deformation. The dynamic model of the oscillating pectoral fin is developed based on the blade element theory. The influence of spanwise flexibility on propulsion performance is analyzed theoretically. Experiments have also been carried out to study the propulsion performance of the bionic pectoral fin by changing spanwise flexibility. Both calculated results and experiment results show that the propulsion performance of the bionic pectoral fin can be enhanced with the certain degree of spanwise flexibility.",

        "abstract": "High feedback gains cannot be used on all robots due to sensor noise, time delays or interaction with humans. The problem with low feedback gain controlled robots is that the accuracy of the task execution is potentially low. In this paper we investigate if trajectory optimization of feedback-feedforward controlled robots improves their accuracy. For rest-to-rest motions, we find the optimal trajectory indirectly by numerically optimizing the corresponding feedforward controller for accuracy. A new performance measure called the Manipulation Sensitivity Norm (MSN) is introduced that determines the accuracy under most disturbances and modeling errors. We tested this method on a two DOF robotic arm in the horizontal plane. The results show that for all feedback gains we tested, the choice for the trajectory has a significant influence on the accuracy of the arm (viz. position errors being reduced from 2.5 cm to 0.3 cm). Moreover, to study which features of feedforward controllers cause high or low accuracy, four more feedforward controllers were tested. Results from those experiments indicate that a trajectory that is smooth or quickly approaches the goal position will be accurate.",

As a solution, we present a unified framework, onLinE rObotic Network formAtion (LEONA), that is general enough to permit optimizing the communication network for different utility functions in non-convex environments. LEONA adopts the principle of \u201coptimism in the face of uncertainty\u201d to allow the team of robots to form optimal network configurations efficiently and rapidly without having to map link qualities in the entire area. We demonstrate and evaluate this framework on two specific scenarios concerning the formation of a multi-hop communication path between fixed end-points: one minimizing the total path cost, and another maximizing the bottleneck communication rate. Our simulation-based evaluation shows that the use of the optimism principle can significantly reduce resources spent in exploring and mapping the entire region prior to network optimization. We also present a mathematical modeling of how the searched area scales with various relevant parameters in each case.",

The mechanism is based on a passive dynamic walker and powered by thermal deformation of bimetal. A prototype is composed of two legs jointed to a waist shaft and cylindrical feet whose bottoms were looped around by bimetal sheets. When the prototype was placed on a horizontal surface heated at 170 \u00b0C, the bimetal sheets deformed to excite lateral swinging motion of the walker body and the walker successfully walked. The paper discusses the gait of the walker by analyzing swing periods in traveling direction and lateral direction. The estimation on the walker gait was quantitatively confirmed through motion tracking of walker legs.",

As a trial, a unidirectional USM having an ultrasonic transducer with mass of 336 mg and rotor of 3 mm diameter is implemented to a belt drive mechanism in place of a DC motor and spar gear unit. At no load and without wings, the USM works well and achieves a flapping frequency exceeding 32 Hz, while the output power is around 36 mW owing to the mismatch of the two vibration modes that dominate the efficiency of the USM. Although the observed lift force remains low because of the lack of USM power and heaviness of the wings, the appropriateness of the mechanical design is confirmed and improvements toward the 10-gram-range flapping MAV with USM are discussed on the basis of these results. Another actuation mechanism of the flapping MAV is proposed.",

        "abstract": "We consider the fundamental problem of gathering a set of n robots in the Euclidean plane which have a physical extent and hence they cannot share their positions with other robots. The objective is to determine a minimum time schedule to gather the robots as close together as possible around a predefined gathering point avoiding collisions. This problem has applications in many real world scenarios including fast autonomous coverage formation. Cord-Landwehr et al. (SOFSEM 2011) gave a local greedy algorithm in a synchronous setting and proved that, for the discrete version of the problem where robots movements are restricted to the positions on an integral grid, their algorithm solves this problem in O(nR) rounds, where R is the distance from the farthest initial robot position to the gathering point. In this paper, we improve significantly the round complexity of their algorithm to R + 2 \u00b7 (n - 1) rounds. We also prove that there are initial configurations of n robots in this problem where at least R + (n - 1) over 2 rounds are needed by any local greedy algorithm. Furthermore, we improve the lower bound to R + (n - 1) rounds for the algorithm of Cord-Landwehr et al.. These results altogether provide a tight runtime analysis of their algorithm.",

The target sound source is often corrupted by coherent broadband noise, which introduces localization ambiguities as noise is often mistaken as the target source. To discriminate the time difference of arrival (TDOA) parameters of the target source and noise, this paper presents a binary mask for weighted generalized cross-correlation with phase transform (GCC-PHAT).

        "abstract": "Trajectory planning is a critical aspect of autonomous tractor-trailer vehicle design. Trajectory planning algorithms usually compute paths first, trajectories are obtained thereafter. This multi-step feature makes those planners inefficacious to handle time-dependent constraints. In this study, we consider the original trajectory planning mission directly, which is described as an optimal control problem containing the kinematics, mechanical/physical constraints, environmental requirements as well as an optimization criterion. In this formulation, only the fundamental driving principles with no special issues (e.g., backing-up maneuver and jackknife) are considered. For example, the prevailing \u201csmall-angle assumption\u201d is not utilized to prevent jackknifing. Instead, we only require that different parts of a tractor-trailer vehicle should not collide, since the emergence of jackknife does not physically violate the kinematics. An interior-point method based simultaneous approach is adopted to solve the formulated optimal control problem. Simulation results verify our proposal is capable of handling scenarios with various user-specified requirements.",

To this end, two contributions are presented: i) A stable force feedback controller that can cope with inherent PAM nonlinearities is synthesized using the dissipativity theory, for each PAM unit. ii) On top of this force feedback controller, a mathematical formulation is developed to compute reference force inputs that correspond to desired joint torque and joint stiffness inputs, concerning both agonist and antagonist PAMs. This strategy enables us to introduce real-time sensory feedback; torque and stiffness control is addressed by means of PAM force feedback control with guaranteed stability. To validate the proposed control scheme, a series of experiments were conducted on an experimental setup. As the result, the controller exhibited favorable torque and stiffness tracking in real-time, demonstrating that it could meet the performance criteria to power exoskeleton systems.",

        "abstract": "Walking controllers for bipedal robots have not yet reached human levels of robustness in locomotion. Imitating the human motor control might be an alternative strategy for generating robust locomotion in robots. We seek to control bipedal robots with a specific neuromuscular human walking model proposed previously. Here, we present a virtual neuromuscular controller, VNMC, that emulates this neuromuscular model to generate desired motor torques for a bipedal robot. We test the VNMC on a high-fidelity simulation of the ATRIAS bipedal robot constrained to the sagittal plane. We optimize the control parameters to tolerate maximum ground-height changes, which resulted in ATRIAS walking on a terrain with up to \u00b17 cm height changes. We further evaluate the robustness of the optimized controller to external and internal disturbances. The optimized VNMC adapts to 90% of random terrains with ground-height changes up to \u00b12 cm. It endures 95% of \u00b130 Ns horizontal pushes on the trunk, and 90% of 8 Ns backward and 4 Ns forward impulses on the swing foot throughout the gait cycle. Furthermore, the VNMC is resilient to modeling errors and sensor noise much larger than the equivalent uncertainties in the real robot. The results suggest VNMC as a potential alternative to generate robust locomotion in bipedal robots.",

A novel torsion joint formed by a pair of antagonistic SMA torsion springs is installed at the distal end together with a pair of antagonistic SMA wires. This design provides articulation within the hemorrhage at the robot tip, thereby enabling effective hemorrhage evacuation. In this paper we derive the forward kinematics of the robot and the constitutive model of the SMA-actuated torsion joint. We also present experimental procedures to characterize parameters of the constitutive model. Finally, a proof-of-concept experiment is presented to show the working of the robot.",

To overcome the problem of restricted motion of today's systems, a hyper-redundant active shaft concept is developed. It features good resistance with respect to manipulation forces through its unique binary, electromagnetic actuation concept. With an active control of each element of the hyper-redundant endoscope shaft and in combination with automated feed motion, it is controlled in a \u201cfollow-the-leader\u201d fashion. In general, this approach is characterized by very good path following capabilities. However, due to its binary actuation concept, joint angles cannot be interpolated continuously. Therefore, an adaption to binary actuation with optimized switching sequences to achieve an appropriate path following performance despite of the restricted motion is proposed.",

        "abstract": "We present a novel approach, entitled acoustic structure from motion (ASFM), for recovering 3D scene structure from multiple 2D sonar images, while at the same time localizing the sonar. Imaging sonar or forward looking sonar (FLS) is commonly used for autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) navigation. An FLS provides bearing and range information to a target, but the elevation of the target is unknown within the sensor's field of view. Hence, current state-of-the-art techniques commonly make a flat surface (ground) assumption so that the FLS data can be used for navigation. Unlike other methods, our solution does not require a flat surface assumption and is capable of utilizing information from many frames, as opposed to pairwise methods that can only gather information from two frames at once. ASFM is inspired by structure from motion (SFM), the problem of recovering 3D structure from multiple camera images, while also recovering the position and orientation from which the images were taken. In this paper, we formulate and evaluate the optimization of several AUV sensor readings of the same scene from different poses, the sonar equivalent of bundle adjustment. We evaluate our approach on both simulated data and FLS sonar data with the assumption that feature extraction and data association have been completed. The acoustic equivalents of those two important features of SFM are left for future work.",

It is expected that by utilising cognitive biases in a robot's interactive behaviours, making the robot cognitively imperfect, will affect how people relate to the robot thereby changing the process of long-term companionship. Previous research carried out in this area based on human-like cognitive characteristics in robots to create and maintain long-term relationship between robots and humans have yet to focus on developing human-like cognitive biases and as such is new to this application in robotics. To start working with cognitive biases `misattribution' and `empathic gap' have been selected which have been shown to be very common biases in humans and as such play a role on human-human interactions and long-term relationships.",

In this paper, the problem of vehicle interaction at an intersection merging scenario is formulated as an Intention-Aware motion planning problem using the tools from Mixed Observability Markov Decision Process (MOMDP). We utilize the tools from recent intention aware planning framework to demonstrate a merging behavior in the presence of human drivers by trying to infer and act according to the intentions of the human drivers. A driver behavior model for T-junction intersections is developed in order to calculate the probabilistic state transition functions of the MOMDP model. With proposed solution, it is demonstrated that using intention aware planning improves performance in comparison to present time to merge approach by lowering accident probability and intersection navigation duration. The proposed method is tested on a real autonomous vehicle (AV) in the presence of human driven vehicles to validate our approach.",

        "track": "main",
        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "Using a new hardware implementation of our designs for tunably compliant spine-like tensegrity robots, we show that the NASA Tensegrity Robotics Toolkit can effectively generate and predict desirable locomotion strategies for these many degree of freedom systems. Tensegrity, which provides structural integrity through a tension network, shows promise as a design strategy for more compliant robots capable of interaction with rugged environments, such as a tensegrity interplanetary probe prototype surviving multi-story drops. Due to the complexity of tensegrity structures, modeling through physics simulation and machine learning improves our ability to design and evaluate new structures and their controllers in a dynamic environment. The kinematics of our simulator, the open source NASA Tensegrity Robotics Toolkit, have been previously validated within 1.3% error on position through motion capture of the six strut robot ReCTeR. This paper provides additional validation of the dynamics through the direct comparison of the simulator to forces experienced by the latest version of the Tetraspine robot. These results give us confidence in our strategy of using tensegrity to impart future robotic systems with properties similar to biological systems such as increased flexibility, power, and mobility in extreme terrains.",

        "abstract": "This paper presents a vision-based Leader-Follower cooperative scheme which consists of two underwater vehicles in the absence of explicit communications and direct information interchange. A novel method for implicitly calculating the relative pose between the two vehicles is introduced. The absolute and relative localization algorithm is solely based on the observation of visual features projected on the vehicles common workspace and it is performed in a strictly decentralized manner. The cooperation task consists of a Leader vehicle which is tele-operated in an open-loop fashion while inspecting a flat surface and a Follower vehicle which follows the Leader while keeping a fixed 2D distance offset. The Follower is able to track the Leader's motion at all desired configurations via a motion tracking controller designed accordingly. The proposed control scheme for the Follower is relayed on vision-based implicit communications data and has analytically guaranteed stability and convergence properties. The accuracy and reliability of the implicit vision-based localization system, the performance of the designed control scheme, as well as the efficiency of the overall system in the proposed cooperative task, are experimentally verified using two small Remotely Operated Vehicles (ROVs) in a test tank.",

However, at present, most 3D SLAM algorithms that do use LiDAR and/or time-of-flight (ToF) sensors exploit only range and bearing information associated with these measurements, but not intensity information. This paper presents a new approach that attempts to explicitly incorporate an intensity model as part of a sparse bundle adjustment (SBA) estimation problem.

        "abstract": "In this paper we address the problem of collaborative active state estimation within the framework of multi-robot simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM). We assume each robot has to autonomously navigate to a pre-specified set of goals in unknown environments and develop an approach that enables the robots to collaborate in order to reduce the uncertainty in their state estimation. We formulate this problem as multi-robot belief space planning, where the belief represents the probability distribution of robot states from the entire group, as well as the mapped environment thus far. Our approach is capable of guiding each robot to reduce its uncertainty by re-observing areas previously observed (only) by other robots. Direct observations between robot states, such as relative-pose measurements, are not required, providing enhanced flexibility for the group as the robots do not have to coordinate rendezvous with each other. Instead, our framework supports indirect constraints between the robots, that are induced by mutual observations of the same area possibly at different time instances, and accounts for these future multi-robot constraints within the planning phase. The proposed approach is evaluated in a simulation study.",

        "abstract": "Flexible bevel-tipped needle steering has been an active research topic since the last decade. However, most of the work presented so far performs flexible needle steering in static phantoms or non-static virtual environments. The insertion of flexible bevel-tipped needles into soft-tissue subjected to motion disturbances is still an open research problem. In this paper, we propose a flexible needle steering algorithm that is able to handle physiological motion disturbances. The system estimates the disturbance using the force information provided by a force sensor placed in contact with the soft-tissue. The system is evaluated through experiments steering a flexible needle towards a physical target into a moving soft-tissue phantom. Three experimental cases with motion disturbances based on clinical procedures in the lung, kidney and heart are used to assess the targeting error. The average targeting error of all 15 experimental trials is 1:05\u00b10:41mm. Our results demonstrate the ability of the proposed system to compensate for motion disturbances applied to the soft-tissue phantom.",

We describe an evaluated robotic agent which takes a natural language instruction stating a step of DNA extraction procedure as a starting point. The system is able to transform the textual instruction into an abstract symbolic plan representation. It can reason about the representation and answer queries about what, how, and why it is done.

        "abstract": "Robot table tennis is a challenging domain in both robotics, artificial intelligence and machine learning. In terms of robotics, it requires fast and reliable perception and control; in terms of artificial intelligence, it requires fast decision making to determine the best motion to hit the ball; in terms of machine learning, it requires the ability to accurately estimate where and when the ball will be so that it can be hit. The use of sophisticated perception (relying, for example, in multi-camera vision systems) and state-of-the-art robot manipulators significantly alleviates concerns with perception and control, leaving room for the exploration of novel approaches that focus on estimating where, when and how to hit the ball. In this paper, we move away from the hardware setup commonly used in this domain\u2014typically relying on robotic manipulators combined with an array of multiple fixed cameras\u2014and give the first steps towards having autonomous aerial table tennis robotic players. Specifically, we focus on the task of hitting a ping pong ball thrown at a commercial drone, equipped with a light cardboard racket and an onboard camera. We adopt a general framework for learning complex robot tasks and show that, in spite of the perceptual and actuation limitations of our system, the overall approach enables the quadrotor system to successfully respond to balls served by a human user.",

Thus, robots that can navigate with minimal computational resources would be able to travel longer distances and, hence, would be valuable tools in applications such as search and rescue or planetary exploration. Inspired from the navigational abilities of insects, we developed the Trail-Map as a data structure for biologically inspired homing that can easily be scaled in case of memory or computational shortage. The Trail-Map can be built in constant time and enables constant time homing vector calculation. In this paper, we evaluate the Trail-Map-based homing performance of a simulated mobile robot equipped with an omnidirectional camera under the presence of sensor noise, such as odometry errors and observation errors. Further, we will show that Trail-Map-based homing outperforms SLAM methods in terms of computational resources while achieving a comparable homing performance.",

        "track": "main",
        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "The Dual-SLIP model has been proposed as a walking template that inherently encodes a rich set of human-like features. Previous work has used the 3D Dual-SLIP with bio-inspired leg actuation to generate a human-like dynamic walking gait over a wide range of speeds. The work presented in this paper extends the 3D Dual-SLIP walking strategy to uneven terrain. With nonlinear optimization based on a multiple-shooting formulation, actuated Dual-SLIP walking gaits over uneven terrain are identified that handle 1-step elevation changes up to \u00b110 cm. Moreover, this Dual-SLIP actuation strategy enables a constant center of mass (CoM) forward speed at leg midstance to be maintained. The resultant gaits have revealed a leg lengthening/shortening strategy that is similar to that adopted by a human when walking over prepared, uneven terrain. Results demonstrate that the CoM trajectories and ground reaction force patterns found with the approach are comparable to the human data found in the biomechanics literature. The trajectories generated by the Dual-SLIP model are also demonstrated to orchestrate a dynamic walking motion with an anthropomorphic humanoid model in simulation over uneven terrain.",

Beyond compressing scene structure based purely on geometry, we aim at developing compact map representations that are useful for re-exploration while preserving scene structure. Our work is evaluated on data collected from a visual sensor and exploits the information intrinsic to the trajectory of exploration together with the visual information of map points. We perform rigorous statistical evaluation and Pareto analysis to show how this approach compares with three widely used baseline compression methods: k-means on point geometry, keyframes and random sampling. Results indicate that compressing maps to levels of 25% or even less of the original data is possible, while preserving good 6D visual relocalisation performance.",

        "abstract": "Robotic grasping has been hindered by the inability of robots to perceive unstructured environments. Because these environments can be complex or dynamic, it is important to obtain additional and precise sensing information just before grasping. This paper expands upon the pretouch modality by introducing a transmissive optical sensor. It can unambiguously indicate the presence or lack of objects in close proximity. A wide variety of items that other sensors fail to sense, such as extremely soft or shiny objects, can be detected by the proposed sensor. The sensor is also fully integrated into the fingertips of the PR2 robotic platform and manufactured with inexpensive, commercially-available components. Several experiments are conducted to verify its utility in both environment perception and robotic grasping. It is shown that the perception information supplied by the sensor facilitates effective robotic grasping.",

Due to the special characteristics of transparent objects, very few vision methods exist to identify them. To achieve our goal, we first use active depth sensor combining with image pre-processing techniques to retrieve transparent candidates. We then propose a transparent candidate classification algorithm using visual cues in color image to further distinguish the transparent ones out of candidates. Experimental results show that our algorithm can achieve good transparent object retrieval results and outperform methods based on depth image. In addition, this algorithm can be integrated with pose estimation methods on robotic bio-laboratory automation applications.",

Therefore the coxa (the hip joint) is completely fixed in this robot, and the only control we have are the linear actuators to stretch the three legs in the radial directions. The robot is developed as a minimal model to examine our basic idea, to make the robot swing by actuating the legs and then generate locomotion utilizing geometric effect of rigid body rolling on a flat floor. The experiments with robot succeeds in forwarding and rotary locomotion with appropriate choices of oscillatory along each leg. Further analysis of the movement of Martian III indicates that the direction of the swing leg depends on the deformation of each leg. Moreover, due to the result of the measurement experiment and movement analysis of rotation locomotion, we found out two typical type of gaits.",

This is significant when payloads (such as cameras, optical systems, armaments) are carried by the robot. In particular, this paper presents an application of an on-line learning method to actively correct the open-loop gait generated by a central pattern generator (CPG) or a limit-cycle method. The learning method employed is based on a Nonlinear Autoregressive Neural Network with Exogenous inputs (NARX-NN)- a recurrent neural network architecture typically utilized for modeling nonlinear difference systems. A supervised learning approach is used to train the NARX-NN. The input to the neural network includes states of the robot legs, trunk attitude and attitude rates, and foot contact forces. The neural network is used to estimate the total torque imparted on the robot. The learned effects of the internal forces and disturbances are then applied in an inverse dynamics/computed torque controller, which is utilized to achieve a stable trunk (i.e., a constant orientation of the trunk). The efficacy of the proposed approach is shown in detailed simulation studies of a quadruped robot.",

        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "The most accurate and dependable approach to the in-vivo identification of human limb stiffness is by position perturbation. Moving the limb over a small distance and measuring the effective force gives, when states are steady, direct information about said stiffness. However, existing manipulandi are comparatively slow and/or not very stiff, such that a lumped stiffness is measured. This lumped stiffness includes the limb response during or after reflexes influenced by both, the passive musculotendon and active neuronal component. As this approach usually leads to inconsistencies between the data and the stiffness model, we argue in favour of fast, pre-reflex impedance measurements-i.e., completing the perturbation movement and collecting the data before effects of spinal reflexes or even from the motor cortex can influence the measurements. To obtain such fast planar movements, we constructed a dedicated orthoglide robot while focusing on a lightweight and stiff design. Our subject study of a force task with this device lead to very clean data with always positive definite Cartesian stiffness matrices. By representing them as ellipses, we found them to be substantially bigger in comparison to standard literature which we address to a larger number of recruited motor units. While ellipses orientation and the length of their main axis increased, the shape decreased with the exerted force. The device will be used to derive design criteria for variable-stiffness robots, and to investigate the relation between muscular activity and areflexive joint stiffness for teleoperational approaches.",

We use the familiar periodic waving gesture as a signal to attract the UAV's attention. The UAV can discriminate this gesture from human walking and running that appears similarly periodic. Once a signaling person is observed and tracked, the UAV acknowledges that the user has its attention by hovering and performing a \u201cwobble\u201d behavior. Both parties are now ready for further interaction. The system works on-board the UAV using a single camera for input and is demonstrated working reliably in real-robot trials.",

A real three-dimensional (3D) sharp and jagged needle shape elaborately like mosquito, however, was difficult to achieve as far as using conventional fabrication methods. For this purpose, a 3D laser lithography with ultrafine resolution of 200 nm (0.2 \u03bcm) is employed in this article. Unlike other reported sole needles, presented microneedle is divided into two half parts, each is shaped like eaves-trough and dependently moved. The combined halves act as one hollow microneedle, which can draw up human blood by capillary action. The resistive force during insertion can be reduced when the two halves are alternately advanced, which mimics the motion of mosquito's proboscis.",

Motivated by human sensorimotor findings, in this work we study the stochastic locally optimal feedback control problem with high-order cost statistics where dynamics have multiple additive noise sources and cost variability produced by each uncertainty source is evaluated marginally. We present risk-sensitive and cost-cumulant solutions for this problem for non-linear dynamics and non-quadratic costs. Locally optimal solutions are found by iteratively performing a linear quadratic approximation around a nominal trajectory, solving the local problem and updating the trajectory until convergence. Simulation results of a point mass robot and a two-link manipulator validate the applicability of the proposed approach and illustrate its peculiarities.",

Their bodies have very complex musculoskeletal structures that contribute to their walking stability and adaptability. In this paper, we focus on the gluteus medius, one of muscles contributing to the support of the pelvis. The gluteus medius supports the pelvis when the leg is in a standing position, but it should not inhibit its smooth swing motion. This mechanism is assumed to be realized by the musculoskeletal structure. This paper is devoted to explaining the mechanism by reproducing it using artificial pneumatic muscles. We developed a musculoskeletal robot with a gluteus medius, and showed that the mechanism is well-designed for realizing two seemingly contradictory functions: being stiff to support the pelvis while standing and being smooth to allow swinging. This finding can be utilized for adaptive walking of musculoskeletal humanoid robots.",

The scheme can give accurate position information and has fast update rate, but is limited to short sensor range with the signal identification problem. The infrastructure-based localization and a method that assigns frequency bands to RF sensors can be a solution to overcome this range limitation without loss of update rate or position accuracy. The RF sensor modules are used as ANs, and are easily identified by their channel assignments. To verify the proposed localization scheme, we organized an experimental environment and performed repetitive experiments to track the positions of mobile nodes and stationary nodes in 2D environments. The experimental results showed reliable localization accuracy with fast sampling rate and demonstrates the feasibility of localization that exploits EM wave attenuation.",

        "abstract": "Our recently developed Reverse Priority (RP) redundancy resolution method is extended here to the presence of unilateral constraints. The RP method computes the solution to a stack of prioritized tasks starting from the lowest priority one, and adding iteratively the contributions of higher priority tasks. In this framework, unilateral constraints can be added efficiently, while guaranteeing also continuity of joint velocity commands. Since unilateral (hard) constraints are typically placed at the highest priority levels, their treatment within the RP method leads to the least possible modification of the solution computed so far, when analyzing the need to activate or not these constraints. The effectiveness of the approach is shown by simulations on a planar 6R robot and on a humanoid robot, as well as experiments on a KUKA LWR manipulator.",

The manipulation can have three goals: the optimization of the hand configuration, the optimization of the grasp quality and the optimization of the object configuration. Three different motion strategies are introduced in order to move the fingers trying to deal with each of the three goals. The strategies can be applied independently or combined in a sequential way. The feasibility of the motion strategies was proven in real experimentation using the Schunk Dexterous Hand SDH2.",

        "abstract": "In this paper we present a methodology for discriminating between different objects using only a single force closure grasp with an underactuated robot hand equipped with force sensors. The technique leverages the benefits of simple, adaptive robot grippers (which can grasp successfully without prior knowledge of the hand or the object model), with an advanced machine learning technique (Random Forests). Unlike prior work in literature, the proposed methodology does not require object exploration, release or re-grasping and works for arbitrary object positions and orientations within the reach of a grasp. A two-fingered compliant, underactuated robot hand is controlled in an open-loop fashion to grasp objects with various shapes, sizes and stiffness. The Random Forests classification technique is used in order to discriminate between different object classes. The feature space used consists only of the actuator positions and the force sensor measurements at two specific time instances of the grasping process. A feature variables importance calculation procedure facilitates the identification of the most crucial features, concluding to the minimum number of sensors required. The efficiency of the proposed method is validated with two experimental paradigms involving two sets of fabricated model objects with different shapes, sizes and stiffness and a set of everyday life objects.",

We use an initial clustering method to group the segmented parts based on appearance and shape, and we further combine the clusters we obtain by analyzing their spatial-temporal behaviors. We show that using the spatial-temporal information further increases the matching accuracy.",

To enable personalised assistance, such robots benefit from building a user-specific model, so that the assistance is customised to the particular set of user abilities. In this paper, we present an end-to-end approach for home-environment assistive humanoid robots to provide personalised assistance through a dressing application for users who have upper-body movement limitations. We use randomised decision forests to estimate the upper-body pose of users captured by a top-view depth camera, and model the movement space of upper-body joints using Gaussian mixture models. The movement space of each upper-body joint consists of regions with different reaching capabilities. We propose a method which is based on real-time upper-body pose and user models to plan robot motions for assistive dressing. We validate each part of our approach and test the whole system, allowing a Baxter humanoid robot to assist human to wear a sleeveless jacket.",

To hold contact to the patient, even after temporally full occlusions, robust user re-identification is essential. Therefore, we implemented a person re-identification module that continuously re-identifies the patient, using only few amount of the robot's processing resources. It is robust to varying illumination and occlusions. State-of-the-art performance is confirmed on a standard benchmark dataset, as well as on a recorded scenario-specific dataset.

However they do not have a fixed base, making them difficult to control accurately. In this paper, a complete modeling approach and an optimization algorithm are presented that show the torques that allow a snake robot to track a trajectory while keeping one of its links from slipping. To do this, it is essential to consider the static friction between the ground and a snake robot. The forces of static friction are modeled as bounded constraints, in a similar fashion as the constraint forces studied in grasping with robotic hands.

        "abstract": "Place recognition is the frond-end of Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM). Topological representations depend on good association of vertices, which ultimately depends on the front-end. In this paper, we consider a robot lost in an unknown environment trying to construct a topological map to localize itself using a laser range finder and odometry information. The algorithm makes use of an efficient observation model based on kernel density estimates (KDEs) to detect loops. The observation model separates the map into regions denominated words, classified based on the density of free space, number of observations and segment orientation. Loop closing results from the matching of sequences of N consecutive words (n-grams). The proposed approach is orders of magnitude faster than a sequence of Iterative Closest Point (ICP) matches. The method is evaluated varying input parameters in real and simulated scenarios.",

        "abstract": "Infant body posture assessment is very important for monitoring the development of motor skills. The currently utilized sensory-supported measurement systems are often subject to shortcomings, such as system complexity or inaccuracy. This paper presents a novel approach integrating a combination of a pressure mattress along with inertial and magnetic measurement units on infant trunk and arms to diminish the effects of such drawbacks. The proposed multi-sensor system is validated by comparison of kinematic parameters, such as head movement, arm workspace area, and spectral arc length of hand velocity data to results of a referential optoelectronic measurement system. Integration of sensory data fusion methods provides high system accuracy and reliability. Acquired results confirm that the proposed system can be used as an adequate substitution to expensive optoelectronic measurement systems, as the arm kinematic estimation errors are in the range of 2 cm. Also presented are the results of simplified system versions with only 1 IMU per arm. Such approaches however result in lower system complexity, but also lower accuracy. Nevertheless results imply that the arm posture and workspace assessment is still reliable enough for frequent practical use. By taking into account all the evaluation results, the proposed measurement system could importantly contribute to the field of sensory-supported infant body posture assessment.",

        "abstract": "In this work we address the problem of finding replacements of missing objects that are needed for the execution of human-like manipulation tasks. This is a usual problem that is easily solved by humans provided their natural knowledge to find object substitutions: using a knife as a screwdriver or a book as a cutting board. On the other hand, in robotic applications, objects required in the task should be included in advance in the problem definition. If any of these objects is missing from the scenario, the conventional approach is to manually redefine the problem according to the available objects in the scene. In this work we propose an automatic way of finding object substitutions for the execution of manipulation tasks. The approach uses a logic-based planner to generate a plan from a prototypical problem definition and searches for replacements in the scene when some of the objects involved in the plan are missing. This is done by means of a repository of objects and attributes with roles, which is used to identify the affordances of the unknown objects in the scene. Planning actions are grounded using a novel approach that encodes the semantic structure of manipulation actions. The system was evaluated in a KUKA arm platform for the task of preparing a salad with successful results.",

Industrial robotic manipulators are designed and built to perform certain predetermined tasks. It is therefore important to incorporate such task requirements during the design and synthesis of the robotic manipulators. Such task requirements and/or performance constraints can be specified in terms of the required end-effector positions, orientations along the task trajectory. In this work, we define, develop and test a methodology that can generate optimal manipulator geometric structures based on the task requirements. Another objective of this work is to guarantee task performance under user defined joint constraints. Using this methodology, task-specific optimal manipulator structures can be generated that guarantee task performance under a set of operating constraints.",

        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "It is easy for human beings to discern whether an observed acoustic signal is a direct speech, reflected speech or noise through simple listening. Relying purely on acoustic cues is enough for human beings to discriminate between the different kinds of sound sources which is not straightforward for machines. A robot equipped with the current robot audition mechanism in most cases, will fail to differentiate a direct speech from the other sound sources because acoustic information alone is insufficient for effective discrimination. Robot audition is an important topic in speech-based human-robot communication. It enables the robot to associate the incoming speech signal to the user for an effective human-robot communication. In challenging environments, this task becomes difficult due to reflections of the direct speech signal and background noise sources. To counter this problem, a robot needs to have a minimum amount of prior information to discriminate the valid speech signal (direct speech) from the contaminants (i.e., speech reflections and background noise sources). Failure to do so would lead to false speech-to-speaker association in robot audition and will gravely impact human-robot communication experience. In this paper we propose to using visual cues to augment the traditional robot audition which relies solely on acoustic information. The proposed method significantly improves accuracy of speech-to-speaker association and machine understanding performance in real environment situation. Experimental results show that our expanded system is robust in discriminating direct speech from speech reflections and background noise sources.",

Formal specifications facilitate the testing and verification process for safety critical robotic systems. However, handling the intricacies of formal languages is difficult and requires a high level of expertise in formal logics that many system developers do not have. In this work, we present a graphical tool designed for the development and visualization of formal specifications by people that do not have training in formal logic. The tool enables users to develop specifications using a graphical formalism which is then automatically translated to Metric Temporal Logic (MTL). In order to evaluate the effectiveness of our tool, we have also designed and conducted a usability study with cohorts from the academic student community and industry. Our results indicate that both groups were able to define formal requirements with high levels of accuracy. Finally, we present applications of our tool for defining specifications for operation of robotic surgery and autonomous quadcopter safe operation.",

In the present work, we evaluated the effect of a liquid membrane on vacuum suction, since the industrial part often has a liquid membrane of, for example, oil and water. The success rate of grip was increased by wetting the surface, regardless of the object's shape and weight, since the liquid membrane filled the gap between the gripper and object. For the same reason, the maximum adsorption force was improved up to 1.8 times of 46 N.",

        "abstract": "A novel variable stiffness actuator composed of a dielectric elastomer actuator (DEA) and a low-melting-point-alloy (LMPA) embedded silicone substrate is demonstrated. The device which we call variable stiffness dielectric elastomer actuator (VSDEA) enables functional soft robots with a simplified structure, where the DEA generates a bending actuation and the LMPA provides controllable stiffness between soft and rigid states by Joule heating. The entire structure of VSDEA is made of soft silicones with an elastic modulus of less than 1 MPa providing a high compliance when the LMPA is active. The device has the dimension of 40 mm length \u00d7 10 mm width \u00d7 1 mm thickness, with mass of \u223c1 g. We characterize VSDEA in terms of the actuation stroke angle, the blocked force, and the reaction force against a forced displacement. The results show the controllable actuation angle and the blocked force up to 23.7 \u00b0 and 2.4 mN in the soft state, and 0.6 \u00b0 and 2.1 mN in the rigid state. Compared to an actuator without the LMPA, VSDEA exhibits \u223c90\u00d7 higher rigidity. We develop a VSDEA gripper where the mass of active parts is \u223c2 g, which is able to successfully hold an object mass of 11 g, exhibiting the high performance of the actuator.",

        "abstract": "In this paper a model-free approach for damping control of Variable Stiffness Actuators is proposed. The idea is to take advantage of the possibility to change the stiffness of the actuators in controlling the damping. The problem of minimizing the terminal energy for a one degree of freedom spring-mass model with controlled stiffness is first considered. The optimal bang-bang control law uses a maximum stiffness when the link gets away from the desired position, i.e. the link velocity is decreasing, and a minimum one when the link is going towards it, i.e. the link velocity is increasing. Based on Lyapunov stability theorems the obtained law has been proved to be stable for a multi-DoF system. Finally, the proposed control law has been tested and validated through experimental tests.",

        "abstract": "Whole-Body Control methods offer the potential to execute several tasks on highly redundant robots, such as humanoids. Unfortunately, task combinations often result in incompatibilities which generate undesirable behaviors. Prioritization techniques can prevent tasks from perturbing one another but often to the detriment of the lower precedence tasks. For many tasks, static prioritization is not necessary or even appropriate because tasks can often be achieved in variable ways, as in reaching. In this paper, we show that such task variability can be used to modulate task priorities during execution, to temporarily deviate certain tasks as needed, in the presence of incompatibilities. We first present a method for mapping from task variance to task priority and then provide an approach for computing task variance. Through three common conflict scenarios, we demonstrate that mapping from task variance to priorities reactively solves a number of task incompatibilities.",

Finally, the visibility reduction caused by simulated and artificial snowfall are measured for verifying the proposed indoor snowfall simulation chamber. Preliminary experiments are also carried out in both snowfall systems in order to evaluate various kinds of vision-based safety sensors for personal care robots.",

        "abstract": "We study the problem of planning paths for a team of robots motivated by coverage, persistent monitoring and surveillance applications. The input is a set of target points in a polygonal environment that must be monitored using robots with omni-directional cameras. The goal is to compute paths for all robots such that every target is visible from at least one path. The cost of a path is given by the weighted combination of the length of the path (travel time) and the number of viewpoints along the path (measurement time). The overall cost is given by the maximum cost over all robot paths and the objective is to minimize the maximum cost. In its general form, this problem is NP-hard. In this paper, we present an optimal algorithm and a constant factor approximation for two special versions of the problem. In both cases, the paths are restricted to lie on a pre-defined curve in the polygon. We show that if the curve satisfies a special property, termed chain-visibility, then there exists an optimal algorithm for monitoring a given set of target locations. Furthermore, if we restrict the input polygon to the class of street polygons, then we present a constant-factor approximation which is applicable even if the set of target locations is the entire polygon. In addition to theoretical proofs, we also present results from simulation studies.",

A low-cost localization solution based on a novel Visible Light Communication (VLC) system for indoor environments is proposed in this paper. A number of modulated LED lights are used as beacons to aid indoor localization additional to illumination. A Gaussian Process(GP) is used to model the intensity distributions of the light sources. A Bayesian localization framework is constructed using the results of the GP, leading to precise localization. Path-planning is hereby feasible by only using the GP variance field, rather than using a metric map. Dijkstra's algorithm-based path-planner is adopted to cope with the practical situations. We demonstrate our localization system by real-time experiments performed on a tablet PC in an indoor environment.",

        "abstract": "The vast majority of existing methods for vision-aided inertial navigation rely on the detection and tracking of point features in the images. However, in several man-made environments, such as indoor office spaces, straight line features are prevalent, while point features may be sparse. Therefore, developing methods that will enable the use of straight-line features for vision-aided inertial navigation can lead to improved performance. While limited prior work on the subject exists, it assumes the use of a global-shutter camera, i.e., a camera in which all image pixels are captured simultaneously. Most low-cost cameras, however, use rolling-shutter (RS) image capture, which renders the existing methods inapplicable. To address these limitations, we here present an algorithm for vision-aided inertial navigation that employs both point and line features, and is capable of operation with RS cameras. The two key contributions of this work are (i) a novel parameterization for 3D lines, which is shown to exhibit better linearity properties than existing ones, and (ii) a novel approach for the use of line observations in images. This approach forgoes line-fitting and does not assume that a straight line in 3D projects to a straight line in the image, and is thus suitable for use with RS cameras. Our results demonstrate that our proposed estimator formulation leads to improved precision, in point-feature-poor environments.",

Our target application is mechanical weed control which for example is needed in organic farming. Today, this task is often performed by field workers, whose availability is declining and the quality of their work differs greatly. In addition, manual weeding is a very tedious task with adverse health effects. Hence, mechanical weed control is considered as a prime example for automation. One of the challenges in order to perform the task efficiently is the need for fast plant detection and precise treatment of single plants with a mobile manipulator. The unstructured environment and rough field conditions raise additional challenges. We introduce a first system concept and control design known to handle these issues. In particular, high speed image processing and visual servoing are applied to precisely position a specially designed weeding tool. To evaluate the performance of the mobile manipulator we run experiments with a mobile test vehicle in field-like conditions and demonstrate that our system can treat single plants in less than 1s as it is required to be competitive.",

        "abstract": "Concentric tube robots have shown promise for minimally invasive surgical (MIS) tasks that require navigation via tortuous anatomical paths. Despite extensive research on their kinematic and dynamic modelling, however, inaccuracies and deformations of their shape due to unknown loads and collisions with the anatomy make intraoperative shape sensing a requirement. This paper presents a vision-based shape-sensing algorithm for concentric tube robots. The proposed algorithm fuses information extracted from a standard imaging modality, monoplane X-ray fluoroscopy, with the kinematics model of the concentric tube robot, to achieve automatic, real-time, accurate and continuous robot-shape estimations despite kinematics' noise and unmodelled forces. Fusion is performed by a fast 2D/3D non-rigid registration, which combines kinematics and intraoperative tracking of the robot. Extensive simulations with a range of noise models and virtual loads acting on the robot, and experimental evaluation in air and in a skull phantom, demonstrate the clinical value of the proposed technique1.",

        "abstract": "The performance of any cooperative task that involves two or more robots will be determined by their capacity to recognize common information of the environment. Vision sensors are very effective for this particular goal, but the cost of transmitting the visual information represents a real issue, even more if communication must be performed in narrow bandwidth networks and/or over a multi-hop path. Visual vocabularies provide a dimensionality reduction that has been effectively used in computer vision to reduce the computational load of performing searches in large volumes of data. In this paper we propose to exploit the same technique to decrease the volume of information that is exchanged in the network. This way, robots do not need to send the full descriptors associated to the features they observe, but only the word indices of the corresponding features in the vocabulary. Experiments with a wide variety of vocabularies are used to evaluate the quality of the association given by the algorithm. Finally, real experiments in a wireless network with a limited bandwidth are reported, showing the advantages of the proposed method compared to the communication of full images or feature descriptors.",

Due to complicated factory environments and missions, unexpected vision occlusion, switching grippers, and grasping the target in motion are demanded. Therefore, a vision guided robotic system consisting of a joint space adaptive controller and a visual target motion estimator is proposed. With the visual target motion estimator, current target velocities and positions are estimated. Regarding the current target velocities and positions, desired robotic joint velocities and positions are computed even if vision is occluded. Moreover, by tracking the desired joint velocities and positions with the adaptive controller, a robotic end-effector is controlled to catch the target even if target and gripper parameters are uncertain. In experiments, grasping the moving target at different speeds with the different grippers for different lengths of occlusion time by using our proposed system were presented for performance evaluations according to its efficiency and robustness.",

        "abstract": "The problem of image based visual servoing for robots working in a cluttered dynamic environment is addressed in this paper. It is assumed that the environment is observed by depth sensors which allow to measure the distance between any moving obstacle and the robot. Also an eye-in-hand camera is used to extract image features. The main idea is to control suitable image moments and to relax a certain number of robot's degrees of freedom during the interaction phase. If an obstacle approaches the robot, the main visual servoing task is relaxed partially or completely, while the image features are kept in the camera field of view by controlling the image moments. Fuzzy rules are used to set the desired values of the image moments. Beside that, the relaxed redundancy of the robot is exploited to avoid collisions. After removing the risk of collision, the main visual servoing task is resumed. The effectiveness of the algorithm is shown by several case studies on a KUKA LWR 4 robot arm.",

In this paper, we propose VoxNet, an architecture to tackle this problem by integrating a volumetric Occupancy Grid representation with a supervised 3D Convolutional Neural Network (3D CNN).

Climbing robots need to be lightweight, and thus many designs use multiple feet on a single rotating wheel-leg.

In this work, we use an improved version of our previous Mushroom-Shaped Adhesive MicroStructured (MSAMS) tape to support a power-autonomous robot reliably walking inverted on glass ceilings. The resulting speeds are greater than one body/length per second, faster than other adhesion-based climbing prototypes. The printed robot design is also a contribution toward future robotic designs and will have future applications in testing new adhesives for robotic feet.",

        "abstract": "Controlling the robot with a permanently-updated optimal trajectory, also known as model predictive control, is the Holy Grail of whole-body motion generation. Before obtaining it, several challenges should be faced: computation cost, non-linear local minima, algorithm stability, etc. In this paper, we address the problem of applying the updated optimal control in real-time on the physical robot. In particular, we focus on the problems raised by the delays due to computation and by the differences between the real robot and the simulated model. Based on the optimal-control solver MuJoCo, we implemented a complete model-predictive controller and we applied it in real-time on the physical HRP-2 robot. It is the first time that such a whole-body model predictive controller is applied in real-time on a complex dynamic robot. Aside from the technical contributions cited above, the main contribution of this paper is to report the experimental results of this premi\u00e8re implementation.",

        "abstract": "Despite having achieved unconstrained stable flight, the insect-scale flapping-wing robot is still tethered for power and control. Towards the goal of operating a biologically-inspired robot autonomously outside of laboratory conditions. In this paper, we simulate outdoor disturbances in the laboratory setting and investigate the effects of wind gusts on the flight dynamics of a millimeter-scale flapping wing robot. Simplified models describing the disturbance effects on the robot's dynamics are proposed, together with two disturbance rejection schemes capable of estimating and compensating for the disturbances. The proposed methods are experimentally verified. The results show that they reduced the root mean square position errors by approximately 50% when the robot was subject to 60 cm\u00b7s\u22121 horizontal wind.",

        "abstract": "This paper gives an analytical description for the ideal and the real workspace of a 6-RSS parallel robot; that is, by considering its geometrical and its mechanical constraints. The ideal workspace is described as a set of inequalities representing a 3D volume that encloses valid attitudes, whose frontier can be plotted as a 3D surface by using Constructive Solid Geometry and an adaptive polygonization method. The real workspace represents a subset of the ideal one, determined by the presence of joint limits at the spherical joints. These ones arise from the fact that these spherical joints are not ideal, but implemented as spherical plain bearings. However, although it is not straight forward to express these joint limits in an analytical way, it was possible to find an analytical expression to describe the real workspace, represented by additional inequalities that must be met by a desired attitude of the platform.",

        "abstract": "In this paper, a novel sEMG decoder was proposed for estimating the detailed human intentions. For the use in practical applications, an sEMG decoder needs to have a high decoding performance, a robustness to the changes of electrode positions, and a capability to extract detailed and continuous intentions behind human motions. The new decoder satisfies all these needs by using a new supervised feature extractor, which was originally designed for discrete output values but modified to deal with the continuous values while maintaining the high performance and the robustness to the change of input variables resulting from the change of electrode positions. Experiments for decoding detailed human intentions, i.e. the angle between phalanges in a single finger, confirms that the high performance of the proposed decoder and that this performance is maintained when the electrode position changes.",
