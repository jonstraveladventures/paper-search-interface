In our laboratory, \"Tri-Star3\"; a horizontal poly-articulated expandable 3-wheeled planetary rover based on the expandable rover has been developed. Tri-Star3 has just only three wheels and passive joints with braking mechanisms. This rover expands or changes its own shape by the driving force produced by each wheel when the joints are free to rotate. Because of these reasons, this rover is comparatively light-weight is cheap to manufacture and it is easy to operated.",

During the process of deriving the equations of motion, the robot body and three wheels of the mobile robot system are viewed as four rigid bodies. The three wheels of the mobile robot are subject to sliding and skidding if the friction force at the contact point can not provide enough resistance to prevent the wheels from slipping. Therefore, the constraint arising from the non-slip condition between the wheels and the ground is released. The Lagrange equations of motion of the system with two inputs are obtained. These derived equations of motion can be expectantly used in many aspects, such as path tracking, adaptive control, and motion control of the mobile robot",

Our algorithm builds upon recent advances in 2D grid-based path planning and extends these techniques to 3D grids. It is often the case for robots navigating in full three-dimensional environments that moving in some directions is significantly more difficult than others (e.g. moving upwards is more expensive for most aerial vehicles). Thus, we also provide a facility to incorporate such characteristics into the planning process. Along with the derivation of the 3D interpolation function used by our planner, we present a number of results demonstrating its advantages and real-time capabilities",

        "abstract": "With 3D (3-dimensional) movement's ability and rhythmic locomotion mode, a nature snake makes itself survive in rugged terrains. The rhythmic activities of most creatures are generated by the CPG (central pattern generator). Based on this fact, the sustained-type neuron has been adopted to construct a cyclic inhibitory CPG model for a snake-like robot whose joints are perpendicularly connected in series. Having compared with the sustained-type neuron and the mutual inhibitory CPG, the cyclic inhibitory CPG was proven to generate capably rhythmic output with the least number of differential equations. In this paper, we introduce the neuron network organized by the cyclic inhibitory CPGs connected in line with unilateral excitation to control the 3D locomotion of a snake-like robot, and present the necessary condition for the CPG neuron network to sustain a rhythmic output. By implementing this control architecture to a simulator with consideration of mechanical dynamics of a real snake-like robot \"Perambulator\", preliminary parameter setting of the CPG neuron network for its 3D locomotion is obtained. Moreover, it is shown that \"Perambulator\" can successfully exhibit 3D locomotion by using the output of the proposed CPG network. The obtained results have also provided a bran new approach to understand the unknown neuron network of nature snakes",

Namely, 3D pose visual servoing, where the end-effector pose is indirectly measured and used for regulation, is shown to be well suited to this task since it relieves the control from the difficult forward kinematic problem. Moreover, this complexity reduction is not coming with an increase of the implementation complexity since off-the-shelf hardware and software are now available for visual servoing. It is also shown that such a control gets rid of joint sensors. All this makes 3D pose visual servoing the most straightforward Cartesian control for parallel robots.

        "abstract": "This paper gives preliminary results about the utilization of an interaction technique called FOLLOW-ME to fasten the selection task for teleoperation system. The implementation of an interaction between a user and a virtual environment (VE) in virtual reality (VR) may use various techniques. However, in the case of teleoperation, the interaction must be very precise and comfortable for the user. The model associated to the FOLLOW-ME technique splits the virtual environment into three zones in which a specific interaction model is used: a free manipulation zone, a scaled manipulation zone and a precise manipulation zone. Each one of the three zones is characterized by a specific interaction granularity. In the precise manipulation zone, we use the concept of virtual guides in order to assist the user to achieve his task. In this paper, our aim is to show that the FOLLOW-ME technique is well suited for selection in teleoperation tasks. To do this, we have first compared the FOLLOW-ME technique with classical interaction techniques in a virtual environment where different targets are situated at different depth and may move. The preliminary results show that our technique is more efficient than the classical go-go and ray-casting techniques, in a sense that the task is more reproducible and easier to accomplish by the user. In a second stage, we use this result to design selection procedures for the ARITI tele-operation system and show that the use of FOLLOW-ME induces benefits for the user",

Spin-images have been proposed to search CAD models database, and use 3D range informations. In this context, the use of a vision system is taken into account through a multi-resolution approach. A method for quickly computing multi-resolution and interpolating spin-images is proposed. The results on simulation and on real data are given, and show the effectiveness of this method",

As result, only forces and torques established by environmental contact(s) remain. Beside an improvement of hybrid force/pose control behavior, an additional major benefit is that regular resetting/zeroing of force/torque sensors before free space/contact transitions can be omitted. All essential equations, transformations, and calculations that are required for this 6D fusion approach are derived. To highlight the meaning for practical implementations, numerous experiments with a six-joint Staeubli RX60 industrial manipulator are presented, and the achieved results are discussed",

This scan matching method divides scan into voxels, and approximates scan points in each cell into normal distribution. That matching time is O(N) with N of the number of input scan points.

        "abstract": "This paper presents a novel application of modular robotic technology. Many researchers expect manufacturing technology will allow robot modules to be built at smaller and smaller scales, but movement and actuation are increasingly difficult as dimensions shrink. We describe an application - a 3D fax machine - which exploits inter-module communication and computation without requiring self-reconfiguration. As a result, this application may be feasible sooner than applications which depend upon modules being able to move themselves. In our new approach to 3D faxing, a large number of submillimeter robot modules form an intelligent \"clay\" which can be reshaped via the external application of mechanical forces. This clay can act as a novel input device, using intermodule localization techniques to acquire the shape of a 3D object by casting. We describe software for such digital clay. We also describe how, when equipped with simple inter-module latches, such clay can be used as a 3D output device. Finally, we evaluate results from simulations which test how well our approach can replicate particular objects",

        "abstract": "The success of a landed space exploration mission depends largely on the final landing site. Factors influencing site selection include safety, fuel-consumption, and scientific return. This paper addresses the problem of selecting the best available landing site based on these factors in real-time during autonomous spacecraft descent onto a planetary surface. The problem is modeled probabilistically using Bayesian networks (BNs). BNs provide a means of representing the causal relationships between variables that impact the quality of a landing site. The final landing site is determined via probabilistic reasoning based on terrain safety derived from on-board sensors, available fuel based on spacecraft descent dynamics, and regions of interest defined by mission scientists",

        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "This paper describes a novel behavior-based approach for an object-pulling robot using Fuzzy Discrete Event System (FDES). The object-pulling task is a variant of objectpushing operation, where the robot anchors itself with an object and then navigates to a target location. The proposed behavior-based approach incorporates global and local motion planning for navigation. The global motion planning uses strategic behaviors that employ prior knowledge of the environment to generate a safe-path from the initial position of the robot to the end-point (goal), whereas the local motion planning uses reactive behaviors that deploy locally sensed sensory data for target-object detection and dynamic obstacle avoidance. The major contribution of this paper is the novel FDES-based behavior selection (or modulation) method that eliminates the conventional binary thresholding-based boolean event generation in Discrete Event System (DES) for behavior activation. The multi-valued logic approach of FDES reduces the possibility of wrong event generation, which in turn decreases the possibility of inappropriate behavior selection. Experimental results using a physical robot are also presented to authenticate the feasibility of the proposed FDES-based object-pulling operation.",

The proposed control law aims at achieving a desired stiffness and damping in Cartesian coordinates while taking account of the base flexibility. The controller does not use any measurement of the base motion, however a model of the base stiffness is required. For the closed loop system, asymptotic stability in case of free motion is proven. Furthermore, considering interaction tasks, it is shown that the controlled manipulator system has a useful passivity property",

Efficient self-localization methods have been developed, among which probabilistic Monte-Carlo localization (MCL) is one of the most popular. It enables robots to localize themselves in real-time and to recover from localization errors. However, even those versions of MCL using an adaptive number of samples need at least a minimum in the order of 100 samples to compute an acceptable position estimation. This paper presents a novel approach to MCL based on images from an omnidirectional camera system. The approach uses an adaptive number of samples that drops down to a single sample if the pose estimation is sufficiently accurate. We show that the method enters this efficient tracking mode after a few cycles and remains there using only a single sample for more than 90% of the cycles. Nevertheless, it is still able to cope with the kidnapped robot problem",

        "abstract": "For sensor-based robot motion planning, view planning problem refers to planning the next sensing action to further facilitate the motion planning task. In Y. Yu and K. Gupta (2004), C-space entropy was introduced as a measure of knowledge of robot configuration space, or C-space. The robot plans the next sensing action to maximally reduce the expected C-space entropy, also called the maximal expected entropy reduction, or MER criterion. It was shown that MER criterion resulted in much more efficient C-space exploration performance than physical space based view planning criteria, such as to maximize unknown physical volume in each view. From a C-space perspective, MER criterion consists of two important aspects: sensing actions are evaluated in C-space (geometric aspect); these effects are evaluated in an information theoretical sense (stochastic aspect). In this paper, we investigate how much of this better performance is attributable to the paradigmatic shift to evaluating the sensor action in C-space, i.e., the pure geometric component of MER, and how much is attributable to the stochastic aspect of MER. We propose C-space based pure geometric criteria (which are essentially geometric aspect of MER) for view planning and compare them with the MER criterion. We empirically show that a great deal of efficiency is attributable to the pure geometric aspect; however, we also show that the stochastic aspect, despite being based on simple assumptions, result in moderately more efficient C-space exploration over the pure geometric component of MER. We outline explanations for our findings",

        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "This paper presents a control approach for human grasp simulation in a real-time context. We consider a 12-dof hand grasping quasi-rigid objects, either for fine manipulation or perturbation rejection. The objective is to translate and rotate the object with respect to non-sliding conditions. In order to improve the visual realism and the stability of the simulation, we use a locally deformable model on fingertips with friction. The resolution of contact forces is used for controlling the system with a set of 23 muscles. This paper presents also a new technique for solving the grasping force optimization problem, allowing real time simulation. This work is part of a virtual human project and combines robotic control experiments and theoretical laws of deformations in a global simulation",

        "abstract": "The field of visual servoing is now widely accepted as a modern, consolidated discipline for vision-based real-time robot control. Though experimental setups have become affordable, theoretical and practical issues arise, which advise the use of simulation systems prior to real execution. This paper presents an object-oriented, cross-platform, network-ready environment for visual servoing simulations. With flexibility and extensibility as the main design goals, tasks can be defined either for cameras attached to moving Cartesian frames, or serial link manipulators. In order to provide fast feedback to the user, it includes real-time 3D rendering of the simulated scene. Task parameters and visual features can be freely chosen, and new features can be easily added to the framework. Output data is logged to disk files, which can be analyzed by any popular mathematical package. The simulator is built upon an agent-based framework, which makes possible the distribution across multiple networked computers. Moreover, it can be securely downloaded from a Web server and automatically installed in a computer, running either Windows, Linux or Mac OS X operating systems. This simulator is now a valuable tool in our research lab, and it has been extensively used by the students of a recent online course on visual servoing",

        "abstract": "Intelligent space (iSpace) is a large scale mechatronics system. It is a multidisciplinary effort whose aim is to produce a network structure and components that are capable of integrating sensors, actuators, DSP, communication, and control algorithms in a manner that suits time-sensitive applications including real-time navigation and/or obstacle avoidance. There are many challenges that must be overcome in order to put such a distributed, heterogeneous system together. This paper deals with one of these issues, i.e. the adverse effect of network and processing delays on the system. Here a delay-resistant sensory motor module for navigating a differential drive unmanned ground vehicle (UGV) in a cluttered environment is suggested. The module consists of an early vision edge detection stage, a harmonic potential field (HPF) planner, a network based quadratic curve fitting controller and gain schedule middleware, (GSM). Though the different techniques used to implement the navigation system have been well-studied as independent modules, the contribution in this paper is the way all these different modules are integrated together for the first time to create an efficient structure for a network based integrated navigation system. The structure of this module and its components are described. Thorough experimental results along with performance assessment comparing the suggested structure to a previous implementation of iSpace are also provided",

        "abstract": "Traditionally, robot control has been done typically by \"highly precise control algorithms\": the position of each movable body part is accurately determined at any time with vast amount of computation. This, however, causes serious problems, particularly in terms of adaptability and energy efficiency. On the other hand, an extreme approach has been gaining a lot of attention recently. A good instantiation is the passive dynamic walker, driven only by exploiting the intrinsic dynamics of its mechanical system. However, the mechanical system is not everything, just as the control system is not everything; \"well-balanced\" coupling between control and mechanical systems should be considered. In addition, the \"meeting point\" between the two systems should be flexibly varied according to the environment encountered. In light of these facts, this study intensively focuses on the stiffness of robots' joints, since this effectively influences the dominance relationship between control and mechanical systems. More specifically, the aim of this study is to develop a \"real-time tunable spring\" that can smoothly change its elasticity without changing its natural length, allowing robot's joints to change their position and stiffness independently",

        "abstract": "This paper discusses experimental verifications of a two-dimensional modular robot called \"Slimebot\", consisting of many identical modules. The Slimebot exhibits adaptive reconfiguration by exploiting a fully decentralized algorithm able to control its morphology according to the environment encountered. One of the significant features of our approach is that we explicitly exploit \"emergent phenomena\" stemming from the interplay between control and mechanical systems in order to control the morphology in real time. To this end, we particularly focus on a \"functional material\" and a \"mutual entrainment\" among nonlinear oscillators, the former of which is used as a spontaneous connectivity control mechanism between the modules, and the latter of which acts as the core of the control mechanism for the generation of locomotion. Experimental results indicate that the proposed algorithm can induce locomotion, which allows us to successfully control the morphology of the modular robot in real time according to the situation without losing the coherence of the entire system",

The strong relation between graph theory and electrical networks is utilized to suggest a discrete counterpart to the boundary value problem used to generate the continuous, harmonic, navigation potential. It is shown that a discrete potential field defined on each vertex of a weighted graph and made to satisfy the balance condition represented by Kirchhoff current law (KCL) is capable of generating a flow field that may be used to build algorithms for finding the minimum cost path between two vertices. Two algorithms of this type are suggested. Supporting definitions and propositions are also provided",

The classical JKR model captures the contact properties for the quasi-static condition, which does not hold in some applications related to micromanipulation. The proposed model includes rate-dependent terms and accounts for dynamic effects such as damping. The model predicts that the threshold of the force for separating two objects in contact depends on the slew rate of the force. The implication of this result in vibrational releasing of micro objects is explored with the goal of minimizing the uncertainty in positions of released objects. Simulation results are reported on releasing of a micro sphere from a cantilever manipulator actuated by a piezoelectric layer",

        "abstract": "The key issue of stereo vision algorithm using dynamic programming approach is to establish the cost function. Normally the cost of a match is the matching difference or matching error. This is almost the same for different algorithms in this approach. The only difference is in the cost of occlusion. Actually the cost of a known occluded point should be zero, because it is a good match. The difficulty is how to find the occluded region. In this paper, we present a new algorithm in which we first find the occluded region in the image using correlation approach. Then we establish a cost function in which the cost of the occluded region is set to zero. Then we use dynamic programming approach to minimize the energy of this cost function. Experimental results show that this algorithm can achieve excellent results with acceptable time efficiency",

        "abstract": "Incremental learning is vital in robots that need to adapt rapidly and respond appropriately to new or unexpected events that occur in its vicinity. This paper describes a novel incremental learning method here demonstrated in its reactive navigation of a mobile robot. The approach records acquired feature vectors in a compact statistical representation we term a frequency table that is purposely designed to contain sufficient information for the generation of a conventional C4.5 decision tree. During learning, further feature vectors can be added in an incremental manner to the frequency table which can then be used to generate new decision trees as required. A major advantage compared with previous incremental decision tree approaches that keep feature vectors in the tree itself, is that the frequency table's memory requirement is fixed and known a priori. Experimental results in the practical application of the method to the real-time navigation of a mobile robot through previously uncharted environments show that the calculation time is typically an order of magnitude less than that of an incremental generation of an ITI decision tree",

In some situations in 3D vision, an object cannot be reconstructed into a 3D model with metric dimensions. Rather, it can only be reconstructed into a 3D structure up to a similarity transformation. To upgrade the 3D model from a similarity transformation to a Euclidean transformation, we propose a method based on the best-focused locations. By analyzing the blur distribution in an image, this method finds the best-focused locations from an image, which provides an additional cue for upgrading the reconstructed 3D structure. Hence, we can obtain not only the object's shape, but also the dimensions and sizes of surface features",

Relatively little has been done on deformable formations composed of rigid links as well as flexible ones. In this paper, we will examine and design controllers for a special type of robotic formations, i.e., those resembling contours. These type of formations have numerous applications in the underwater world, including adaptation to plume boundaries and isoclines of concentration fields, flock shepherding, and shape formation. We adopt general curve evolution theory as a suitable abstraction to describe the motion of such formations. We will first design controllers using simple geometrical reasoning, based on basic requirements on connectivity and mission accomplishment, and will later show that they lead to the same controller structure",

        "abstract": "This paper proposes the new innovated 4-legged locomotion mechanism with pantograph-jack structure as its leg. This study aims at developing the practical robotic system, especially focusing on the carrying task of heavy load. Transportation of heavy load occupies the important parts among the real applications such as disaster relief and rescue activities. The jack-like leg enables to hold a heavy object without any active control and consumption of energy. Additionally, it can lift up an object easily by smaller power than weight of object. Prototype uses the crawl walking which is a typical locomotion way of a reptile, and it has achieved this step by bending its waist. The prototype realized the 0.001 m/s walking and payload of 45 kg. This paper deals with the concept of locomotion mechanism with jack-type leg, details of design of prototype and some properties by some basic experiments",

        "abstract": "We present a computational framework for automatic deployment of robots in 2D and 3D rectangular environments with polytopal obstacles. The results are derived for polytopal robots that can only translate with velocities restricted to polyhedral sets. Our approach consists of three steps: (1) constructing a discrete representation of the problem by using hierarchical partitions in the form of quad-trees and oct-trees, (2) planning the motion in the finite dimensional quotient produced by the partition, and (3) generating provably correct robot feedback control laws by constructing a hybrid system. Given the environment and robot geometry and constraints, generation of control laws is completely automated. The computation consists of polyhedral operations and searches on graphs",

Two main problems of formation control are investigated - maintaining correct formation position and inter-formation collision avoidance. A leader-follower approach with minimal communication between robots is presented here. Separate fuzzy logic controllers are developed for formation position control and internal collision avoidance with a higher level fuzzy coordinator used to fuse their outputs. A major issue in formation control is the presence of uncertainties in the real world, in the form of noisy sensor data and delay in leader position transmission. Noise is added to the simulated data to prove that the system is capable of tolerating such disturbance. The system has the ability to create any desired geometrical formation shape",

        "abstract": "The strong impairment of motor functions in stroke survivors affects daily activities such as eating, manipulating objects or writing. Our goal is to induce long lasting improvements in such tasks by having patients perform systematic exercises using haptic interfaces. This paper describes a novel two-degrees-of-freedom interface which we have developed to help stroke patients gradually recover the ability to open and close the hand and manipulate knobs. Different solutions are studied and a design consisting of two parallelogram structures interacting with the fingers is proposed. The mechanical design offers the possibility to adapt the interface to various hand sizes and finger orientations, and to right or left-handed subjects. Design kinematics as well as actuation and system control are described. Several knobs are proposed to interact with patients, especially a cone mechanism to train a complete opening movement from a strongly contracted and closed hand to a large opened position. The interaction force with the subject is measured over four force sensors located close to the output of the interface. A preliminary study has been performed to evaluate the performances of the haptic interface",

However, exerting impulsive force is one of the most difficult tasks for humanoid robots, because a reaction force caused by the applied impulsive force may bring the humanoid robot down. This paper discusses a humanoid robot motion to generate a large force utilizing an impact. Breaking wooden boards by Karate-chop is taken as a case study because it is a typical example of tasks that utilize impulsive force. A humanoid robot motion for the Karate-chop is carefully designed to maximize the speed of a hand keeping the stability. In order to validate the designed motion, experiments are carried out using a small humanoid robot Fujitsu HOAP-2. In the experiments, three kinds of wooden boards are tested to break by the Karate-chop. The strength of wooden boards is estimated striking the boards with a free-falling plummet. Stabilizing control is also applied to the robot in order to stabilize the body after the impact. The experimentation results are reported in the paper",

        "abstract": "Online self collision detection system for humanoid robots is an essentially important function for developing sensor based behaviors without worrying about breaking hardware. In this paper, we propose a practical and real-time self collision detection system for humanoid robots that satisfy both enough a range of movement and a safety margin. Previous researches usually add a safety margin around each link to cope with errors in both modeling and control. However this margin significantly decreases a range of movement of a joint, especially a compound joint, a joint between adjacent links and composed of 2 or 3 revolute joints whose axis intersect in a same point. In order to gain enough a range of movement and safety margin, we developed hybrid approach that uses both table based collision checking for compound joints and online geometrical model checking with a simplified link shape for other joints. We have experimentally evaluated our self collision detection system using a HRP2-JSK humanoid robot. Our demonstration shows that the robot automatically stops its motion when self collision occurs",

According to the local sensing information and assigned goal, the partial motion planning determines a local target point for the mobile robot, and the trajectory composed of the local targets is near optimal in the sense of a given cost function. Behavior coordination based on emotional mechanism is proposed in the navigation control of mobile robots. The emotion system can properly reflect environment states, and then effectively synthesize rational and complex behaviors. The proposed hybrid approach is competent for the mobile robot to navigate autonomously and effectively in unknown environments. Simulation results demonstrate that the robot motion trajectory using the proposed hybrid navigation approach is more reasonable than the one using a pure behavior-based control or emotion-based behavior coordination alone",

        "abstract": "We proposed in a previous paper a hybrid technique, combining local steering behaviors and coordination graphs (CG), that allows real-time motion planning of multiple agents in a narrow passage. This hybrid technique not only avoids deadlocks, but also exhibits other interesting behaviors such as leader following, even though they are not explicitly coded in the algorithm. In this paper, we build upon the earlier result, and propose a two-layered approach to motion planning of multiple agents in virtual environments, consisting of open spaces connected by multiple narrow passages. The discrete generalized Voronoi diagram (GVD) of the static environment is used to identify all narrow passages automatically. The global path of each agent is also planned using the GVD. As each agent moves along its global path, it is locally modified using the hybrid technique combining steering behaviors with coordination graphs. Experimental results show that the resulting planner is able to plan motions of 30 agents in a virtual environment with three narrow passages in real-time, and the pre-processing phase of our approach is extremely fast. Since all planning is done in real-time, the approach allows an agent to change its final destination at runtime",

        "abstract": "Robotic systems like humanoid frequently move to undesirable pose while being visually controlled at the boundary of its workspace, because the working environment is quite huge as compared with the robot's workspace. The main objective of this paper is to deal with problems occurring at the boundary of the robot's workspace. In addition, current typical problems on IBVS and PBVS, e.g., control in 2D and 3D space, task singularity, robustness to camera and robot calibration error, and robot singularity will be considered. To achieve the objective, the proposed two-stage visual servo system consists of exploring and positioning stages. In the exploring stage, given camera parameters, the target pose of the camera is estimated from the obtained images without the knowledge of the object. In the next positioning stage, a new hybrid control law that moves the camera equipped to a robot end-effector to around the target pose, which is estimated in the first stage and then positions it to the target pose more accurately using IBVS is proposed. Although the target pose is located out of the robot's workspace, the proposed visual servo system shows the proper behavior at the boundary of its workspace. Finally simulation and experimental results shows the feasibility of the proposed visual servo system",

The large-displacement FPM has large motion range more than 1 mm. Moreover, the decoupled XYZ-stage has small cross-axis error and small parasitic rotation. In this study, the typical prismatic joints are investigated, and a new large-displacement prismatic joint using notch hinges is designed. The conceptual design of the FPM is proposed by assembling these modular prismatic joints, and then the optimal design of the FPM is conducted. The analytical models of linear stiffness and dynamics are derived using pseudo-rigid-body (PRB) method. Finally, the numerical simulation using ANSYS is conducted for modal analysis to verify the analytical dynamics equation. Experiments are conducted to verify the proposed design for linear stiffness, cross-axis error and parasitic rotation",

Several tests were made to prove the reliability of this method, that has proved to be useful to extract the information required by the race. Fusion was performed both at a low and medium level: terrain slope, detected with stereo vision, was used to correct pitch information of laserscanner raw data. Object segmentation is applied on a bird view bitmap where each pixel represents a square area of the world in front of the vehicle; this bitmap is obtained from the fusion of the ones generated by each sensor",

Traditionally, this problem has been studied with a flat world assumption wherein the robot motion has only three degrees of freedom. In this paper, we generalize this for the full six-degrees-of-freedom Euclidean motion. Given relative pose estimates and their covariances, our formulation uses the underlying Lie algebra of the Euclidean motion to compute the absolute poses. Ours is an iterative algorithm that minimizes the sum of Mahalanobis distances by linearizing around the current estimate at each iteration. Our algorithm is fast, does not depend on a good initialization, and can be applied to large sequences in complex outdoor terrains. It can also be applied to fuse uncertain pose information from different available sources including GPS, LADAR, wheel encoders and vision sensing to obtain more accurate odometry. Experimental results using both simulated and real data support our claim",

Odor source localization is an interesting application in dynamic problems. Modified particle swarm optimization is a well-known algorithm, which can continuously track a changing optimum over time. PSO can be improved or adapted by incorporating the change detection and responding mechanisms for solving dynamic problems. Charged PSO which is another extension of the PSO has also been applied to solve dynamic problems. We adopted two types of modified concepts of PSO for a new algorithm in order to control autonomous vehicles in more realistic environment where a speed limitation of the robot behavior and collision avoidance mechanism should be taken into consideration as well as the effect of noise and threshold value for the odor sensor response, also positioning error of GPS sensor of robot. Simulations illustrate that the new approach can solve such dynamic problems in advection-diffusion odor model environment",

A leader-follower robotic system is chosen as a platform to benchmark the performance of the multiagent fuzzy policy reinforcement learning algorithm. Our simulation results demonstrate that the control performance can be improved in many aspects.

        "abstract": "Intelligent autonomous mobile robots must be able to sense and recognize 3D environment for navigation and task execution, where they live or work. To achieve this, a variety of techniques have been developed for the determination of the 3D scene geometric information such as stereo vision, laser structured light, laser range finder and so on. But these methods have many limitations such as susceptibility to noise, low speed in 3D scene etc. To overcome these limitations we introduce a new sensing algorithm, which is based on the moire technique and stereo vision. To verify the efficiency and accuracy of our algorithm, a series of experimental tests is performed",

        "abstract": "Lens distortion is one of the main factors affecting camera calibration. In this paper, a new model of camera lens distortion is presented, according to which lens distortion is governed by the coefficients of radial distortion and a transform from ideal image plane to real sensing array plane. The transform is determined by two angular parameters describing the pose and two linear parameters locating the position of the sensing array plane. Compared with the conventional ones, the new model has fewer parameters to be calibrated and more explicit physical meaning. Calibration method of the new model is also proposed. Experiments show that calibration results from the new model and method can correct lens distortion better than conventional ones",

Given a discrete description of the object boundary, a partial representation of the force-closure space considering the position of two contact points is obtained. The computational cost of this representation is low and it still includes enough information to obtain suitable grasps as well as independent regions on the object boundary, such that a finger in each region ensures a force-closure grasp independently of the exact position of the contact points. The procedure has been implemented and several examples of the proposed methodology are included in the paper",

In order to test its availability, the architecture is implemented and instanced as a remote control simulation system of Puma560 robot. The system is experimented and a network test is carried out to evaluate the structure; the results show that the architecture is suitable for many kinds of robot remote control scenarios despite the tough network environment",

A real-time fuzzy logic self-motion planner is devised to create desired self-motion magnitudes and a robust adaptive neural-network controller is designed to accomplish multiple secondary tasks without affecting the primary one in the workspace.

The primary focus of the research described in this paper is to propose a new method for creating a complete model of free-form surface object from multiple range images acquired by a scan sensor at different space poses. Using the view sphere to limit the number of possible sensor positions, the candidates for the next-best-view (NBV) position are easily determined by detecting and measuring occlusions to the camera's view in an image. Ultimately, the candidate which obtains maximum the known partial modeling boundary integral value of the vector fields is selected as the next-best-view position. We also present a self-termination criterion for judging the completion condition in the measurement and reconstruction process. The termination condition is derived based on changes in the volume computed from two successive viewpoints. The experimental results show that the method is effective in practical implementation",

        "abstract": "Efficient adaptive strategies are required to facilitate the role of robotic vehicles as mobile platforms supporting sensing, monitoring, and tracking capabilities. Such strategies utilize a representation of sensor variable fields as a basis for the selection of sample points. In this paper a curvature based criterion for sample selection is presented. The curvature-sensitive sampling algorithm (CSS) utilizes the estimated second-derivative of an intermediate variable field to select sample points of interest for complex process models, such as used in oceanographic sampling with AUVs. For processes for which little or no prior knowledge base exists, an iterative curvature-based adaptive sampling algorithm (ICASA) is presented. The ICASA algorithm iteratively selects sets of sample locations based on non-parametric field representations. These algorithms are evaluated with respect to simulated data, experimental data, and data from oceanographic models. The performance is shown to be significantly better than the conventional uniform grid methodology. The selected iterative samples are used to create a path plan for a robotic vehicle sampling in the region of interest",

It is a variant of the tripod based parallel machine and has a similar architecture to the Orthoglide. In order to reduce the number of passive joints and remove the effect of ease of abrasion of revolute joints, spherical joints are applied in the parallelogram. A mathematic mobility analysis shows the mechanism is indeed 3-DoF purely translational. We optimally design the Orthotripod and the tripod based parallel machine by maximizing the well-conditioned workspace. The optimized Orthotripod possesses a nearly ball-shaped workspace and has much better kinematic performance than the optimized tripod based parallel mechanism. The proposed mechanism is adaptable for machine tool applications",

Based on the combination of the multiple-model adaptive estimation (MMAE) algorithm and the Boolean logic reasoning, the MMBLR approach is properly fit for the fault detection and identification (FDI) application to the climbing robot. In the MMBLR architecture, the MMAE algorithm is used to reliably detect and identify the model-known faults. Then based on the robot's states and the results of the MMAE, other faults are detected and identified using the Boolean logic reasoning. Experimental results validated that the faults of the sensors and actuators in the suction foot control of the robot can be readily detected and identified by the MMBLR approach",

As time and accuracy are primordial factors to save lives in such a situation, the use of automation and robotic concepts on the control of those machines becomes necessary. The standard approach is to use manual teleoperation based on a bilateral master/slave system, to enhance the maneuverability of the machines, but their diversity is nearly never taken into account. We propose here, a modular platform based on an original synchronization of module states that allows easy manipulator changes and flexibility of use.

An algorithm so called simplex method is developed for the purpose of calibrating this manipulator by means of a camera-based data acquisition system. Calibration is performed according to the inverse kinematic model method. The Simplex method algorithm doesn't identify directly the errors of geometry parameters, but finds the most appropriate control model taking all the errors into account, thus can improve the moving accuracy of the end-effector sharply. In the calibration process, matrix regrouping method is introduced to obtain the most appropriate control model. After getting the control model experimentally, verification experiments utilizing a laser interferometer have also been conducted to prove the effectiveness of this novel calibration method",

        "abstract": "This paper presents a method for the forward/reverse velocity analysis of N-DoF (N<6) parallel manipulator which is developed from kinematic influence coefficient method (KIC). With this method, a 6timesN Jacobian will be achieved for an N-DoF parallel manipulator. The selection of an instantaneous coordinate frame for a configuration of the mechanism is the key of this method. In the instantaneous coordinate frame, there are 6-N zero components in the velocity vector of end-effector. Similar with the KIC method, the method has uniform formulas, which is convenient for programming. In the rear part of the paper, a 4-DoF 4-RURR mechanism is taken as the mechanism example",

To realize high maneuverability such as getting over high steps or no deadlocks when it overturned, a rotational symmetrical structure and a center of gravity shifting mechanism are proposed. The robot is composed of triangle-shaped and straight crawlers connected by two links. The triangle-shaped crawlers can rotate about the axis bar by 360 degrees freely. The robot can get over steps by hanging one of the edges of the triangle-shaped crawlers on an obstacle and rotating the crawlers. In the video, the robot can surmount a 32 cm step which is higher than the robot. The robot system must be useful for information gathering tasks by integrating a sensor network technology into the robot system.",

        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "The goal of this paper is to monitor in-process on-board data as a means of indicating product quality and to be able to respond quickly to unexpected process disturbances. Due to pending environmental legislation and market requirements, lead-free soldering is widely used by the electronics industry. As the margin between the higher melting temperatures of lead-free solders and the heat-resistant temperatures of electronic components becomes narrower than lead solders, a more precise control of the temperature is required. Traditionally, the control processes of the on-board temperature are open loop because it is difficult to monitor the temperature on a PCB board. In this paper, we establish a method to determine the real process temperatures at any point on a PCB board in the furnace. We develop the method based on support vector machines (SVM) with multiple-input single-output strategies to learn relationship between the temperatures near the PCB board and the on-board temperature. The method is the only one which has been commercially utilized to predict the on-board temperature because of its low cost and high accuracy",

        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "Image segmentation is a critical task in computer vision. In the context of motion detection, a very popular segmentation approach is background subtraction which consists in classifying the pixels as background and foreground. Then, the foreground pixels are grouped together to find objects, this task is known as object extraction. There are several different approaches to object extraction (e.g. connected component labeling, morphological operators, size thresholding and clustering) amongst them, cluster based approaches are, probably, the ones with a stronger theoretical foundation. However, their application to object extraction is difficult because of three problems: a) need to know the number of objects to be detected beforehand, b) high sensibility to initialization due to a trend to get stuck in local minima and c) high complexity which makes difficult their application in real-time. This paper proposes an algorithm which aims to combine the strong theoretical foundations of clustering with the speed of other approaches. This is possible due to the introduction of a novel self organizing network (SON) which has a robust initialization schema and is able to find the number of clusters in the image. The algorithm has a time complexity of order NM where N is the number of foreground pixels in the image and M is the number of nodes in the SON",

To maximise the chance of success the design must be performed with consideration of the likely target environment. Current knowledge on building collapse debris fields suggest that robots must be able to move through and underneath debris utilizing void spaces. Due to the likely chance of void spaces being partially blocked, an USAR robot should have manipulation capability, a very under-explored area of USAR robotics. The moving of debris can be likened to the digging action of some animals such as the European mole.

        "abstract": "This paper introduces a novel robot which can run on the surface of water in a manner similar to basilisk lizards. Previous studies on the lizards themselves have characterized their method of propulsion and their means of staying afloat. By slapping and stroking their feet into the water, the lizard effects a momentum transfer which provides both forward thrust and lift. The design of a biomimetic robot utilizing similar principles is discussed, modeled, and prototyped. Functionally, the robot uses a pair of identical four bar mechanisms, with a 180deg phase shift to achieve bipedal locomotion on the water's surface. Computational and experimental results are presented and reviewed with the focus being a maximization of the lift to power ratio. After optimization, two legged models can experimentally provide 12-15 g/W of lift while four legged models can provide 50 g/W of lift. This work opens the door for bipedal and quadrupedal robots to become ambulatory over both land and water, and represents a first step toward studies in amphibious stride patterns; step motions equally conducive to propulsion on water and land",

The dynamic model includes five joints, i.e. two ankles, two hips and one lumbosacral joint makes up a multi-link system, and is driven by two pairs of muscles, the psoas major (PM) and glutaeus medius (GM). Ankle and lumbosacral joint sway in almost the same amplitude, whereas, their phase difference being approximately equal to pi. The result suggests that the trunk is maintaining its stance perpendicular to horizon. By applying human physical parameters to the model the body sways and its spectral response can be simulated. The simulated results are quite agree with the experimentally recorded both in body sway and in spectral response. It is suggest that balance keeping in upright standing can be fulfilled on this PID controller, and this model can be applied to individual body stability assessment",

        "abstract": "This paper presents a path planner based on PRM framework for robots operating in changing environments, in which obstacles can move randomly and robots may change their original shapes, e.g. a robot manipulator grasps an object. W-C nodes mapping coupled with lazy edges evaluation is used to ensure a generated path containing only valid nodes and edges when constructed probabilistic roadmap becomes partially invalid in changing environments. Our method combines merits of DRM and Lazy PRM methods. W-C nodes mapping, which is constructed in pre-processing phase by mapping every basic cell in workspace to nodes of roadmap, is preserved to indicate invalid nodes of roadmap fast whenever obstacles move. W-C edges mapping, which is another mapping relationship of DRM method, is skipped since it is much more complicated and time-consuming for construction. The simplified mapping with smaller size can be recomputed or modified fast when robots change their original shapes. Instead, lazy edges evaluation is used to ensure all edges valid along a found path. Simulated experiments for a dual-manipulator system show that our method is efficient for path planning in changing environments",

        "abstract": "Mobile robots operating in home environments must deal with constrained space and a great variety of obstacles and situations to handle. This article presents a pilot study aiming at identifying design specifications of a new user interface and robot specifications to improve efficiency and security for novice teleoperators of a mobile robot used in home environments. This pilot study is part of the familiarization phase of an iterative interdisciplinary design process aiming at outlining critical design and experimental issues before engaging into detailed design processes, elaborated experimental methodology and rigorous testing of the various capabilities of mobile robots for home care applications. We evaluated, with a small set of trained and untrained operators, two conceptually different user interfaces for teleoperated mobile robotic systems. These results demonstrate the challenges and the necessity of conducting trials in home environments to evaluate such teleoperated systems, and outline distinct preferences regarding robot capabilities, user interface navigation method and evaluation methodology",

The particularity of this method is that no specific desired value is specified for the visual features involved in the control scheme. Indeed, visual features are only constrained to belong to a confident interval, which gives more flexibility to the system. While this formalism can be used for several types of visual features, it is used in this paper for improving the on-line control of the visibility of a target. The principle is to make a compromise between the classical positioning task and the visibility constraint. Experimental results obtained with a six degrees of freedom robot arm are presented, demonstrating the performance of the proposed method",

        "abstract": "This paper deals with solving robot cooperative task conflict using robot assistive behavior processing. These conflicts could occur in reactive multi mobile robot task. To manage such conflicts, each robot must assist the other units from their own capacities. A role method based on capacity adjustment is proposed. A role is a specific robot assistive behavior. Conflicts are then compensated by role switching. The same processing can be used in man-robot interaction. In this case, the robot has to define the efficient role in order to assist the man. A specific multi mobile robot conflict problem is studied: a constraint case of a reactive handling task with two mobile robots. This is a critical task since the object transported is only held by robot compression. Any degraded case, hardware failure or tactical conflict occurrences, would lead to a task deadlock. To define the global assistive role, on-line fuzzy reinforcement is used to adjust basic behaviors. In the studied case, no explicit communication is used to define the relationship between the robots in order to be generalized to man-machine cooperation. Our goal is to develop a strategy to manage interaction with handicapped persons. We studied a robotic rollator. In this case, the assistive role of rollator has to be adjusted in order to compensate the man's task",

This paper presents a framework for designing a real-time vision based hand-body dynamic gesture recognition system for such robots. The said framework works in real world lighting conditions with complex backgrounds, and can handle intermittent motion of the camera. We present here a novel way in which the motion history image (MHI) and the motion energy image (MEI) is built. We propose a robust combining of the motion and color cues and we call this image as motion color image (MCI). The input signal is captured by using monocular color camera. Vision is the only feedback sensor being used. It is assumed that the gesturer is wearing clothes that are slightly different from the background. Gestures are first learned offline and then matched to the temporal data generated online in real time. We have tested this on a gesture database consisting of 11 hand-body gestures and have recorded recognition accuracy up to 90%. We have partially implemented and testing the system for Sony's Aibo robot dog using remote framework (RFW) SDK by Sony",

Particle filters maintain multiple hypotheses simultaneously and use a probabilistic motion model to predict the position of the moving object, and this constitutes a bottleneck to the use of particle filtering in real-time systems due to the expensive computations required. In order to track moving objects in real-time without delay and loss of image sequences, a particle filter algorithm specifically designed for a circuit and the circuit of the object tracking algorithm using the particle filter are proposed. This circuit is designed by VHDL (VHSIC hardware description language), and implemented in an FPGA (field programmable gate array). All of the functions of the proposed particle filter used to track moving objects are implemented in the FPGA. The object tracking system employing this circuit is implemented and then its performance is measured",

This approach relies on the fact that the rear of the opaque walls is not visible. Thus, to detect the walls in an indoor environment a set of hypothetical walls, based on the ceiling edges or ground level edges, are considered; and their validity is checked using point cloud, generated by a sensor. A certainty factor is calculated for each detected wall, which is updated continuously based on the newly gathered sensory information. Furthermore, the certainty of the walls can be updated using other source of information for better and more reliable wall detection. The novelty of this approach is in its capability to handle environments, with texture-less walls, in real-time. The algorithm has been implemented in simulation, and tested in real environment and has shown effective, reliable and real-time performance",

We provide a new approach to system calibration, geometric information acquisition, and surface parameterization, and also implement a prototype system of rapidly establishing textured model that is available to virtual reality application.",

The method maps the dynamic environment into a model in the velocity space, computing the times to potential collision and potential escape and the associated robot velocities. The problem of finding a trajectory to the goal is stated as a constrained nonlinear optimization problem. The initial seed trajectory for the optimization is directly generated in the velocity space using the model built. The method is applied to robots which are subject to both kinematic constraints (i.e. involving the configuration parameters of the robot and their derivatives), and dynamic constraints, (i.e. the constraints imposed by the acceleration/deceleration capabilities). Some experimental results are discussed",

        "abstract": "This paper describes a multiple sensor fusion approach in which a sensor based navigation scheme needs to fuse a stochastic aerial robot position estimate from an extended Kalman Filter (EKF) with a deterministic aerial robot position estimate from an Interval Analysis (IA) algorithm. The aerial robot is equipped with inertial sensors (INS) and ultrasonic sensors. An EKF is used to estimate the aerial robots position using the inertial sensors. When landmarks are present, the ultrasonic sensor measurements are processed using an IA algorithm to get an interval aerial robot position estimate. In order to obtain a better estimate for the aerial robot position both deterministic and stochastic estimates need to be used via a data fusion approach. Thus there is a need to study how to fuse the aerial robot position estimate having a Gaussian distribution (from EKF) with a aerial robot position estimate that has a uniform distribution (from IA). This is accomplished here by using the Box-Muller transform to transform the interval aerial robot position estimate having a uniform distribution to a real number aerial robot position with a Gaussian distribution and giving that as a measurement to the EKF to obtain a fused estimate of the aerial robot position.",

        "abstract": "Computer vision and pattern recognition technologies make robots' eyes possible, which has rapidly promoted the development of robotic sciences. Barcode, which is simple but contains much information, has been used in navigation, manufacture and other situations by robots. Reading a barcode based on image analysis is an essential technique for such a robot system. Unfortunately, few existing image analysis methods about it are capable of identifying the codes under uncertain conditions, such as varying illumination, different sizes or orientations. This paper presents a method which can locate barcode region at an uncertain 3-D background through hierarchically extracting the distinct features of it with a high precision even for the broken, aberrant, partly blotted out stripes and other poor qualities of images. The method begins with a barcode quality assessment, in which a set of omnidirectional scan lines (active set lines) and a set of description of the whole image (resembling barcode measure), are defined. According to RBM, a series of corresponding methods are chosen to have a pre-processing process of the image and decode the codes respectively. The experiment results prove that our proposed method has two main characteristics. One is fast to locate barcode (get ROI of barcode). The other is to read barcode under unpredicted conditions robustly",

        "abstract": "We present a robust strategy for docking a mobile robot in close proximity with an upright surface using optical flow field divergence. Unlike previous approaches, we achieve this without the need for explicit segmentation of the surface in the image, and using complete optical estimation (i.e. no affine models) in the control loop. A simple proportional control law is used to regulate the vehicle's velocity, using only the raw, unfiltered flow divergence as input. Central to the robustness of our approach is the derivation of a time-to-contact estimator that accounts for small rotations of the robot during ego-motion. We present both analytical and experimental results showing that through tracking of the focus of expansion to a looming surface, we may compensate for such rotations, thereby significantly improving the robustness of the time-to-contact estimate. This is demonstrated using an off-board natural image sequence, and in closed-loop control of a mobile robot",

        "abstract": "A robust model fitting technique is presented for recovery of structure and motion from a sequence. The error bound of the inliers is not needed and the outliers are assumed to be randomly (uniformly) distributed. Unlike other methods in the RANSAC family that need some prior information or a scale estimator to select the best consensus set, we estimate the parameters of the model directly based on Bayesian theory and kernel density estimation. Then the estimated parameters can be used directly or used to determine the best consensus set. The advantage of the proposed method is that it can robustly determine the best consensus set without any prior information of the data and need a lower computational cost than other auto-scale algorithms in the RANSAC family. The proposed method is applied to structure from planar motion estimation. The experiments indoor and outdoor have been done to verify the performance of the algorithm and the very promising results are obtained",

In this paper we present a set of design criteria for how such \"skins\" should be designed. Based on this criteria, a \"skin\" which features temperature, force, and electric field sensing is described. Results from early experiments with this skin show how the sensors of the multi-modal skin complement each other and allow the distinction between social and affective classes of touch to be distinguished from touch with physical objects",

Emotion modules of the CPR Interaction system stimulate human touch-sense through vibrations, olfactory-sense through perfumes, and visual-sense through motion patterns. Biometric signals of human can be effectively measured with ECG and EDR. Experimental results show these easy-to-mount on CPR Equipments are sufficient for generating reliable signal measurements.

Automating this task could greatly reduce total surgery time for patients. Current solutions to this problem replay manually programmed trajectories, but a more general and robust approach is to use supervised machine learning to smooth surgeon-given training trajectories and generalize from them. Since knottying generally requires a controller with internal memory to distinguish between identical inputs that require different actions at different points along a trajectory, it would be impossible to teach the system using traditional feedforward neural nets or support vector machines. Instead we exploit more powerful, recurrent neural networks (RNNs) with adaptive internal states. Results obtained using LSTM RNNs trained by the recent Evolino algorithm show that this approach can significantly increase the efficiency of suture knot tying in MIS over preprogrammed control",

The three-level structure, namely moton index, moton and moton distribution, is defined to synthesize motions. To describe the continuous and nonlinear dynamics of human motion, the motion texture is modeled by a non-stationary switching linear dynamic system (NS-SLDS), which improves the switching linear dynamic system (SLDS) by non-stationary functions. A BSK-tree (binary key-pose splitting tree) retrieval method applied in motons supplies the ability to access data in frame-level. Thus the motion texture can be manipulated at three different levels, by retrieving key-frame in specific moton, by changing the details of a specific motion at the moton-level and by designing a new choreography at the distribution-level. In motion synthesis experiments, the proposed approach was proved flexible and effective",

The proposed procedure is very fast and completely automatic, as the user is only asked to collect a few images of a checker board, and click on its corner points. In contrast with previous approaches, this technique does not use any specific model of the omnidirectional sensor. It only assumes that the imaging function can be described by a Taylor series expansion whose coefficients are estimated by solving a four-step least-squares linear minimization problem, followed by a non-linear refinement based on the maximum likelihood criterion. To validate the proposed technique, and evaluate its performance, we apply the calibration on both simulated and real data. Moreover, we show the calibration accuracy by projecting the color information of a calibrated camera on real 3D points extracted by a 3D sick laser range finder. Finally, we provide a Toolbox which implements the proposed calibration procedure",

        "abstract": "Intraoral radiography is one of the most important techniques for dentists, which is commonly used to diagnose dental caries and gum disease. An intraoral radiograph shows a perspective projection image of the teeth of patient, so that the roentgenogram is affected by the positional relationship between film, teeth, and indicator cone which directs X-ray radiation toward the film. In order to administer intraoral radiography for a patient, he/she has to have a small X-ray film inserted in their oral cavity. The position and orientation of the film are properly adjusted by the dentist or radiologic technician. And then, the indicator cone is positioned outside the patient's mouth, and its orientation is determined depending on the teeth and film. Recently, it has been reported that the skill of intraoral radiography of dental students and interns are declining in Japan. The background of this issue is that the conventional training method needs to use an actual X-ray machine and lots of film, and much time to develop the roentgenogram. We assumed that these training inefficiencies would be improved by using virtual reality technique. In this paper, we propose a training simulator for intraoral radiography based on virtual reality, where the trainees quickly obtain a graphical image of intraoral radiograph on a computer display after the setting of film and indicator cone is finished. This paper presents a simulation algorithm for generating a graphical image of intraoral radiograph, and discusses about optimum design of an indicator cone positioning device for the simulator. Simulation results show that the proposed simulation algorithm provides realistic observations of intraoral radiograph",

The biomimetic leg is composed of two segments of ICPF (ionic conducting polymer film) actuators with a 2-DOF motion. It has simple structure, simple control method, and good localization characteristic. We designed and developed a prototype microrobot with 3 units of the legs. The dimension of the microrobot is 48*20*17 mm3 and its dried weight is 0.65 g. We have measured the speeds with different control signals. The experimental results show that it can arrive at a speed of 4.7 mm/s with a control signal of 5 Hz and 10 V. And results indicate that the novel type leg has a good speed performance and localization in aquatic environment. The microrobot using ICPF actuators has powerful applications in the biomedical and naval fields",

        "abstract": "A novel force field (F2) method with variable speed for multi-robot motion planning and collaboration is presented in this paper. The basic concept of the F2 method is to generate a force field for every robot based on and continuously changing according to its status including traveling speed, dimension, priority, location and environmental factor, etc. The interactions among robots' force fields and obstacles provide a natural way for collision avoidance and collaboration while robots are on their way to goals. Previous F2  method assumes that robots travel with constant speeds and can react instantly to the resultant force to change their orientations. Starting from a problematic situation brought out by this hypothesis, this paper remedies the F2 method by taking robots' dynamics and kinematics characteristics into consideration. In the variable speed force field method (VSF2), a robot can change its own speed according to environment information and its own status. Simulations in a real indoor environment were carried out and demonstrated the feasibility and effectiveness of this method",

As we are better able to simulate the real world, we can usefully perform more research in simulated environments. The key aspects of a good simulator, an accurate physics simulation and realistic graphical rendering system, are also central to modern computer games. In this paper, we describe a robot simulation environment built from technologies typically used in computer video games. The simulator is capable of simulating multiple robots, with realistic physics and rendering. It can also support human-controlled avatars using a traditional first-person interface. This allows us to perform robot-human interaction and collaboration studies in the simulated environment. The distributed nature of the simulation allows us to perform large-scale experiments, with users participating from geographically remote locations",

The application presented in this paper is nasotracheal suctioning. This application trains and evaluates in an intuitive way, using force feedback, an elaborate visual interface, and a variety of auditory cues (sounds and verbal instructions). It allows the practitioner to perform this procedure repeatedly in a safe environment before conducting it on a live patient",

In this paper, an extended MCL method (EMCL) is developed by incorporating two different resampling processes, namely importance resampling and sensor-based resampling, to conventional MCL for improvement of localization performance. Different resampling processes are utilized based on a matching of sample distribution and observations. Two additional processes for validating over-convergence and uniformity are introduced for examination of such matching. A visual based EMCL is further implemented using a triangulation-based resampling from visual features recognized by Bayesian networks. Experiments are conducted to demonstrate the validity of the proposed approach",

        "abstract": "This paper introduces a workflow for robot assisted neurosurgery. The system consists of a robot for precise positioning and a vision system for intro-operative registration. The vision system uses two cameras and templates to automatically track dynamic targets. In order to accurately position the end of the robot during operation, the robot arm must occupy the least space, be easy to move and be well balanced. Cylindrical configuration is chosen in this case as a suitable type of arm. Based on the Jacobian matrix of robot and the conditioning number of the matrix, the optimal dexterous region of the robot is found to satisfy desired dexterity. The successful clinical application verifies the effectiveness of the robot system",

        "abstract": "This paper presents a decentralised particle filtering algorithm that enables multiple vehicles to jointly track 3D features under limited communication bandwidth. This algorithm, applied within a decentralised data fusion (DDF) framework, deals with correlated estimation errors due to common past information when fusing two discrete particle sets. Our solution is to transform the particles into Gaussian mixture models (GMMs) for communication and fusion. Not only can decentralised fusion be approximated by GMMs, but this representation also provides summaries of the particle set. Less bandwidth per communication step is required to communicate a GMM than the particle set itself hence conversion to GMMs for communication is an advantage. Real airborne data is used to demonstrate the accuracy of our decentralised particle filtering algorithm for airborne tracking and mapping",

The present paper represents the motor control mechanism as a hierarchical distributed control system including the time delay, and it is shown that the Renshaw cell could contribute toward stabilizing the time delay loop in the hierarchical distributed control system.

        "abstract": "In this paper, we seek to understand how leg muscles and tendons work mechanically during walking in order to motivate the design of efficient robotic legs. We hypothesize that a robotic leg comprising only knee and ankle passive and quasi-passive elements, including springs, clutches and variable-damping components, can capture the dominant mechanical behavior of the human knee and ankle during level-ground walking at self-selected speeds. As a preliminary evaluation of this hypothesis, we put forth a simple leg model that captures the gross features of the human leg musculoskeletal architecture. We vary model parameters, or spring constants, damping levels and times when clutches are engaged, using an optimization scheme where errors between model joint behaviours and biological joint mechanics are minimized. For model evaluation, kinetic and kinematic gait data are employed from a single participant walking across a level-ground surface at a self-selected gait speed (1.3 m/sec). With only a single hip actuator, we find good agreement between model predictions and experimental gait data, suggesting that knee and ankle actuators are not necessary for level-ground robotic ambulation at self-selected gait speeds. This result is in support of the idea that muscles that span the human knee and ankle mainly operate eccentrically or isometrically, affording the relatively high metabolic walking economy of humans",

        "abstract": "In this paper, an algorithm for human head detection over a distance exceeding 2.5 m between a camera and an object is described. This algorithm is used for the control of a robot, which has the additional limits of a moving camera, moving objects, various face orientations, and unfixed illuminations. With these circumstances, only the assumption that human head and body contours have an omega (Omega) shape is made. In order to separate the background from these omega shapes, the three basic features of gray, color and edge are used, and combined. The skin color cue is very useful when the image stream is frontal and has large face regions, and additionally has no background objects similar to the skin color. The gray cue is also important when captured faces have a lower gray level than background objects. The edge cue is helpful when captured background objects have similar gray levels and colors to those of a head, but can be discriminated by edges. Since these three methods have roughly orthogonal failure results, they serve to complement each other. The next step is a splitting method between the head and body region using the proposed method. The final step is an ellipse fitting and a head region verification algorithm. The results of this algorithm provide robustness for head rotation, illumination changing, and variable head sizes. Furthermore, it is possible to carry out real time processing",

        "abstract": "For AFM based robotic nanomanipulation system without displacement sensor, one of the key technical problems is to realize high accurate positioning of the AFM probe. To solve the problem, based on the hysteresis and nonlinear characteristics analysis of AFM PZT actuator, a new actuating method called \"actuating method based on reappearing the scanning trajectory\" is presented to actuate the PZT actuator. Then two kinds of probe positioning errors, namely kinematics coupling errors due to the tube actuator's bend motion and probe tip's positioning errors caused by cantilever deflections, are compensated to further improve the probe's positioning accuracy. Nanopatterning experiments are performed to verify the effectiveness of the new actuating method and the compensation methods of probe positioning errors",

We define a stiffness observer which detects hard contact instant by analyzing the generated force in the slave side to activate a passivity controller.

        "abstract": "Active SLAM poses the challenge for an autonomous robot to plan efficient paths simultaneous to the SLAM process. The uncertainties of the robot, map and sensor measurements, and the dynamic and motion constraints need to be considered in the planning process. In this paper, the active SLAM problem is formulated as an optimal trajectory planning problem. A novel technique is introduced that utilises an attractor combined with local planning strategies such as model predictive control (a.k.a. receding horizon) to solve this problem. An attractor provides high level task intentions and incorporates global information about the environment for the local planner, thereby eliminating the need for costly global planning with longer horizons. It is demonstrated that trajectory planning with an attractor results in improved performance over systems that have local planning alone",

The playground consists of small tiles each capable of outputting coloured light, sensing force applied on them and communicating with neighbouring tiles. It is shown that a child's behaviour on the playground can be classified within eight categories by an ANN inputting the child's perception of the playground and the corresponding action performed; thus, enabling the playground to adapt real-time according to the classification. The playground has been developed, implemented and tested on a group of children. An ANN was trained using a subgroup of the children whose behaviour corresponds to the eight categories. Validating the ANN against the rest of the children's behaviours it was found that 96% were correctly classified. The trained ANN has been utilized in adapting the playground according to several playing strategies and validated by means of a statistical analysis of physiological signals (e.g. the heart rates of the children)",

        "abstract": "This paper presents an adaptive causal model method (adaptive CMM) for fault diagnosis and recovery in complex multi-robot teams. We claim that a causal model approach is effective for anticipating and recovering from many types of robot team errors, presenting extensive experimental results to support this claim. To our knowledge, these results show the first, full implementation of a CMM on a large multi-robot team. However, because of the significant number of possible failure modes in a complex multi-robot application, and the difficulty in anticipating all possible failures in advance, our empirical results show that one cannot guarantee the generation of a complete a priori causal model that identifies and specifies all faults that may occur in the system. Instead, an adaptive method is needed to enable the robot team to use its experience to update and extend its causal model to enable the team, over time, to better recover from faults when they occur. We present our case-based learning approach, called LeaF (for learning-based fault diagnosis), that enables robot team members to adapt their causal models, thereby improving their ability to diagnose and recover from these faults over time",

Firstly, in order to overcome the difficulty that the dynamic equations of dual-arm space robot system can not be linearly parameterized, the system is modeled as under-actuated robot system. And then with the augmentation approach, we demonstrate that the dynamic equations of the system can be linearly dependent on inertial parameters. Based on the results, an adaptive control scheme of dual-arm space robot system for coordinated motion between the base's attitude and the arm's joints is developed. The asymptotic stability of the control scheme is proved with Lyapunov method. A planar dual-arm space robot system with two objects is simulated to verify the proposed control scheme",

A distributed network of small, inexpensive vehicles with heterogeneous sensors allows us to build a robust monitoring network capable of real-time response to rapidly changing sensor data. The major objective of this paper is to describe a framework for adaptive and cooperative control of the autonomous sensor platforms in such a network. This framework has two major components, a sensor that provides high-level state information to a behavior-based autonomous vehicle control system and a new approach to behavior-based control of autonomous vehicles using multiple objective functions that allow reactive control in complex environments with multiple constraints. Experimental results are presented for a 2-D target tracking application using a network of autonomous surface craft in which one platform with a simulated bearing sensor tracks a moving target and relays the target state information to a second vehicle that is moving in a classification mode. From these results, it is readily seen that there is the potential for potent synergy from the cooperation of multiple sensor platforms which can each view an event of interest from a different vantage point",

        "abstract": "We created a human-robot communication system that can adapt to user preferences that can easily change through communication. Even if any learning algorithms are used, evaluating the human-robot interaction is indispensable and difficult. To solve this problem, we installed a machine learning algorithm called interactive evolutionary computation (IEC) into a communication robot named WAMOEBA-3. IEC is a kind of evolutionary computation like a genetic algorithm. With IEC, the fitness function is performed by each user. We carried out experiments on the communication learning system using an advanced IEC system named HMHE. Before the experiments, we did not tell the subjects anything about the robot, so the interaction differed among the experimental subjects. We could observe mutual adaptation, because some subjects noticed the robot's functions and changed their interaction. From the results, we confirmed that, in spite of the changes of the preferences, the system can adapt to the interaction of multiple users",

        "abstract": "To address perception problems we must be able to track dynamics targets of the environment. An important issue of tracking is filtering problem in which estimates of the target's state are computed while observations are progressively received. This paper presents an adaptive interacting multiple models (IMM) based filtering method. Interacting multiple models have been successfully applied to many applications as they allow, using several filters in parallel, to deal with the uncertainty on motion model, a critical component of filtering. Indeed targets can rapidly change their motion over a lapse of time. This is the case of pedestrians for which it is difficult to define an unique motion model which matches all their possible displacements. Nevertheless, the transition probability matrix (TPM) which models the interaction between different filters in an IMM is in currently defined a priori or needs an important amount of tuning to be used efficiently. In this paper, we put forward a method which automatically adapts online the TPM. The TPM adaptation using on-line data significantly improves the effectiveness of IMM filtering and so better target estimates are obtained. To validate our work we applied our method to pedestrian tracking in car parks on a real platform",

Decision rules are derived to determine novel faults based on these parameters. Fault state space is adapted according the number of detecting novel fault.

In this paper, we propose an adaptive position control method for the fully constrained parallel wire-driven systems that use the minimum number of wires under zero-gravity conditions. Unfortunately, conventional methods of adaptive control cannot be used directly because of the nonlinearity of an internal force term. To overcome such an impossibility, we incorporate a new idea into the conventional method to separate the internal force term linearly. Not only does this adaptive control method ensure precise positioning using external sensors; it enhances the robustness for uncertainty of the Jacobian matrix, which results from the error of actuator installation. First, we explain the linearization of the internal force term. Next, the adaptive control method for the parallel wire driven system using the uncertain Jacobian matrix is proposed; then we prove the motion convergence to desired points and discuss its robustness based on Lyapunov stability analysis. Finally, the usefulness of the proposed control scheme is demonstrated through both experiments and simulation",

The feedback gains are obtained by the solutions of a series of linear matrix inequalities (LMIs). The design approach reduces conservatism inherent in robust control with a fixed gain controller and improves performances in time-response. Numerical simulations illustrate the theoretical results",

No prior knowledge about the sensor and object properties is given to the algorithm. The mode seeking is based on mean shift algorithm, which has been widely used and tested in 3D laser scan segmentation, machine learning and pattern recognition applications.

It is also easy to generate optimal gaits on terrains of different slopes or on stairs under different motion requirements. Dynamic simulation results show the validity and robustness of the approach. The gaits generated resulted in human-like motions optimized for stability, even walking speed and lower leg-strike velocity of the swing foot",

(2004), and uses animation channels for playing and blending multiple animations concurrently. The presented improvement is twofold. First, this paper describes an extension to the computational structure of an animation channel. A fading mechanism is added to an animation channel in order to realize a smooth transition from one animation to another. Secondly, this paper explains how to setup animations for a user-interface robot application. A technique based on behavior mode animations and action animations is described for this. The animation system has been implemented and tested using the Philips iCat Research Platform",

MRFs are smart materials which change their rheology according to an external magnetic field. The new architecture here proposed results from the development and improvement of earlier prototypes. The innovative idea behind this device is to allow subjects interacting directly with an object, whose rheology is rapidly and easily changeable, freely moving their hands without rigid mechanical linkages. Numerical advanced simulation tests using algorithms based on finite element methods have been implemented, in order to analyze and predict the spatial distribution of the magnetic field. A special focus was laid on investigating on how the magnetic filed profile is altered by the introduction of the hand. Possible solutions were proposed to overcome this perturbation. Finally some preliminary psychophysical tests in order to assess the performance of the device are reported and discussed",

        "abstract": "It is argued that a robotic system that is capable of implicit communication with a human and can modify its behavior appropriately based on such communication could be useful. This paper presents a closed loop human-robot interaction framework where the robot can recognize the affective state of the human implicitly and adapt to it appropriately. Affective cues are inferred by a robot in real-time using psychophysiological analysis where the physiological signals are measured through wearable biofeedback sensors. A robot-based basketball game is designed where a robotic \"coach\" monitors the participant's anxiety to alter the difficulty level of the game in a real-time closed loop manner. The results are compared with situations when anxiety is not monitored and the game is adapted only according to the performance. Results show that monitoring and responding to affective cues led to higher performance improvement of the participants under lower anxiety. This is the first time, to our knowledge, that the impact of such implicit communication between a robot and a human has been demonstrated experimentally",

Trajectory and velocity following issues for industrial manipulators are considered by using an error-reduction admittance control method. A number of experiments are presented. Experimental results show that this adaptive feedback controller can be used in industrial multi-robot coordination and force-guided assembly.

Design automation of these actuators often involves solving a magnetic field problem. This paper presents an adaptive meshless method (MLM) that inherits many advantages of FEM but needs no explicit mesh structure for design of EM actuators. Specifically, this paper offers a technique to estimate the distribution of numerical errors and a scheme automatically inserts additional nodes to improve computational accuracy and efficiency. Five examples are given; the first three are numerical examples, where exact solutions are available, provide a means to validate the adaptive MLM and evaluate its effectiveness against MLM with uniform node distribution. The other examples, where the magnetic forces are computed from the Lorenz's law, illustrate the use of adaptive MLM for the pole design of a three-DOF EM actuator. We also verify the results by comparing the computed forces against published experimental results",

Traditionally, explicit communication amongst the robots of a MRS has been broadcasted or eliminated altogether. The limits of these two approaches prevent the widespread deployment of useful decentralized MRS. In this paper, we present and analyze, both analytically and empirically, a communication protocol that we call random peer-to-peer or RP2P. Using RP2P, a decentralized MRS can share state in logarithmic time with respect to system population. Additionally, the load placed upon the individual robots by RP2P is independent of system population size. Potential applications of random peer-to-peer communication also are provided, including state sharing, decision-making and task allocation.",

        "abstract": "Research of autonomous mobile robots has mostly emphasized interaction and coordination that are naturally inspired from biological behavior of birds, insects, and fish: flocking, foraging, collecting, and sharing. However, most research has been only focused on autonomous behaviors in order to perform robots like animals, whereas it is lacked of determinant to those behaviours: energy. Approaching to cluster animal and the higher, collective and sharing food among individuals are major activity to keep society being. This paper issues an approach to sociable robots using self-maintained energy in cooperative mobile robots, which is dominantly inspired from swarm behavior of collecting and sharing food of honey-bee and ant. Autonomous mobile robots are usually equipped with a finite energy, thus they can operate in a finite time. To overcome the finitude, we describe practical deployment of mobile robots that are capable of carrying and exchanging fuel to other robots. Mechanism implementation including modular hardware and control architecture to demonstrate the capabilities of the approach is presented. Subsequently, the battery exchange algorithm basically based on probabilistic modeling of total energy on each robot located in its local vicinity is described. The paper is concluded with challenging works of chain of mobile robots, rescue, repair, and relation of heterogeneous robots",

        "abstract": "Many approaches for extracting landmarks and objects from a camera image based on their color coding were published in the RoboCup domain. They are quite sophisticated and tuned to the typical RoboCup scenario of constant bright lighting using a static subdivision of the color space into different color classes. However, such algorithms would soon be of limited use, as the future requirements of RoboCup include the possibility to play under changing and finally natural lighting. This paper presents an algorithm for automatic online color training, which is able to robustly adapt the mapping of colors to color classes onto different lighting situations online. Using the ACT algorithm a robot will be able to play a RoboCup match while the illumination of the field varies",

The project aims to develop an energy-efficient, noiseless, untethered swimming robot for mobile sensing purposes. The robot is propelled by an ionic polymer-metal composite (IPMC) actuator and equipped with a GPS receiver, a ZigBee wireless communication module, a microcontroller, and a temperature sensor for autonomous navigation, control, and sensing. The two phases of the development are described, emphasizing both the technical approaches and the learning paradigms.

        "abstract": "An effective Kalman filter localization method for mobile robots is investigated in terms of the robust Kalman filter with perturbation estimator. In the recursive algorithm, the perturbation estimator produces equivalent perturbations with respect to the nominal state equation and the action model of a mobile robot is adaptively modified with the perturbation estimates. The integral control property of the perturbation estimator enables a great reduction of the localization error, specifically when the odometric disturbance is large. The Kalman filter recursive equations including predictor, corrector, perturbation estimator, and the corresponding covariance propagation equations are formulated systematically. The effectiveness of the proposed scheme is verified through simulation and experimental results for a wheeled mobile robot",

Finally, the algorithm normalizes the orientation, the scale and the grayscale of the face image. The experimental results demonstrated that this algorithm can detect and normalize the face image efficiently and accurately. The algorithm can be used in face recognition because the normalized faces can improve the recognition rate.",

        "abstract": "In Bayesian based approaches to mobile robot simultaneous localization and mapping, Rao-Blackwellized particle filters (RBPF) enable the efficient estimation of the posterior belief over robot poses and the map. These particle filters have been recently adopted by many exploration approaches, to whom a central issue is measuring the certainty inherent to a given estimation in order to be able to select robot actions that increase it. In this paper we propose a new certainty measurement grounded in information theory that unifies the two kinds of uncertainty which are intrinsic to SLAM: in the robot pose and in the map content. Most previous works have considered only one of them or a weighted average. Our method combines them more appropriately by first building an expected map (EM) which condenses all the current map hypotheses and then computing its mean information (MI) - an entropy derived measurement that quantifies the inconsistencies in the EM. Experimental results comparing our method (EMMI) with others verify its correctness and its better behavior for detecting the decrease in certainty when the robot enters unexplored areas and its increase after closing a loop",

The data show that a relationship exists between the independent variables (frequency, amplitude, and grit size) and the dependent variable (perceived texture). We then considered the perceived tactile perception in relation to viscoelastic properties of the human fingerpad. We obtained remarkable psychophysical results and also identified the relation between tactile sensation and the mechanical stimuli from a biomechanical viewpoint",

        "abstract": "This paper presents a novel algorithm for simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) of mobile robots. The proposed algorithm, termed as evolutionary SLAM, is based on an island model genetic algorithm (IGA). The IGA searches for the most probable map(s) such that the underlying robot's pose(s) provide a robot with the best localization information. The correspondence problem in SLAM is solved by exploiting the property of natural selection, to support only better performing individuals to survive. The algorithm does not follow any explicit heuristics for loop closing, rather maintains multiple hypotheses to solve the loop closing problem. The algorithm processes sensor data incrementally and therefore, has the capability to work online. Experimental results in different indoor environments validate the robustness of the proposed algorithm",

        "abstract": "In a pedestrian detection system, a classifier is usually designed to recognize whether a candidate is a pedestrian. Support vector machines (SVM) has become a primary technique to train a classifier for pedestrian detection. However, it is hard to give the best training model which has a tremendous effect to the performance of a SVM classifier. In this paper, we design special code/decode scheme and evaluation function for a training model firstly; and then use genetic algorithm to optimize key parameters which represent the SVM training model. Therefore a most suitable SVM classifier can be obtained for pedestrian detection. Experiments have been carried out in a single camera based pedestrian detection system. The results show that the evolutionary SVM classifier has a better detection rate; moreover, RBF kernel is more suitable than polynomial kernel when chosen in an evolutionary SVM classifier for pedestrian detection",

        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "Modern sophisticated robots, e.g. humanoids, require significant real-time communication speed in their fieldbuses. Several existing field-bus technologies, like controller area network (CAN), Profibus etc., provide real-time performance and reliability, however the bandwidth is not enough to support the communication demand of the complex humanoids. In this research, we have addressed this critical issue by utilizing comparatively faster IEEE 1394 serial bus on commercial off-the-shelf hardware and Linux-based real-time software platforms. Since the lack of user-level communication protocols in IEEE 1394 standard is a major obstacle for designing a IEEE 1394 based control system, we have solved this issue by customizing the predefined IEEE 1394 packet formats. Moreover, various IEEE 1394 serial bus related features have been investigated for designing an efficient humanoid control system. In this work, we have followed the real-time modeling and analysis method using Unified Modeling Language (UML). A use case driven analysis of timing requirement and determination of real-time constrain have been shown to prove the usefulness of our approach. The ongoing implementation of this proposed system in our network based humanoid, MAHRU, has been demonstrated in both commercial RTOS RTLinux (Pro) and free OSS RTOS Xenomai. The performance measurement of basic IEEE 1394 read transaction has been shown in both platforms along with a comparison with similar experiment on CAN bus. This provides an estimation of performance improvement of a humanoid control system on IEEE 1394 serial bus over CAN bus. Moreover the results obtained from two different Linux-based RTOS platforms indicate their relative pros and cons. This also enables us to select the suitable real-time framework for designing an efficient IEEE 1394 based humanoid control system",

However, the major drawback of Gilbert algorithm is that in many cases it becomes very slow as it approaches the final solution and the vertices selection vibrates in these cases. In this paper: a) It is proven theoretically that when the selection of vertices vibrates among several points, the algorithm will converge to the hyperplane determined by these points. b) Based on the above results, an improved Gilbert algorithm for computing the distance between two convex polytopes is presented. The algorithm can avoid the slow convergence of the original one. Numerical simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness and advantage of the improved algorithm",

In this paper, we propose an inchworm-like locomotion mechanism, which is composed of a permanent magnet, a plunger, a solenoid and a cone-shaped polymer. When an alternating current is applied to the solenoid, the magnet will make a reciprocating movement under the electromagnetic force. With the friction difference produced by the polymer, the actuator could propel itself forward on a 2D surface. The working principle and kinetic model of the mechanism are analyzed. A prototype with a size of Phi12*37 mm were fabricated to study the feasibility of the mechanism. Experiments were carried out on the surfaces of various frictional coefficients. The results show that the actuator works more efficiently on the surface of the glass than on the paper, because the polymer has better clamping effect on the former. The velocity changes with the frequency and amplitude of the current. The mechanism consumes a low power and it can work under a relatively low voltage (less than 20 V). It has the potential for actuation of an active capsule endoscope",

Usually 2D images acquired with common diagnostic equipments such as UT, CT and MRI are not enough and complete for an accurate 3D reconstruction. There are some interpolation methods for approximating non value voxels which consume large execution time. We introduce a novel algorithm based on generalized regression neural network (GRNN) which can interpolate unknown volxes fast and reliable. The GRNN interpolation is used to produce new 2D images between each two succeeding ultrasonic images. It is shown that the composition of GRNN with image distance transformation can produce higher quality 3D shapes. The results of this method are compared with other interpolation methods practically. It shows this method can decrease overall time consumption and conserve the quality on online 3D reconstruction",

The proposed omnidirectional sensor uses two mirrors, which improves the degree of freedom of the design for satisfying each property.

        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "Metabolic studies have shown that there is a metabolic cost associated with carrying load (T. M. Griffen, et al., 2003). In previous work, a lightweight, underactuated exoskeleton has been described that runs in parallel to the human and supports the weight of a payload (C. J. Walsh, et al., 2006). A state-machine control strategy is written based on joint angle and ground-exoskeleton force sensing to control the joint actuation at this exoskeleton hip and knee. The joint components of the exoskeleton in the sagittal plane consist of a force-controllable actuator at the hip, a variable-damper mechanism at the knee and a passive spring at the ankle. The control is motivated by examining human walking data. Positive, non-conservative power is added at the hip during the walking cycle to help propel the mass of the human and payload forward. At the knee, the damper mechanism is turned on at heel strike as the exoskeleton leg is loaded and turned off during terminal stance to allow knee flexion. The passive spring at the ankle engages in controlled dorsiflexion to store energy that is later released to assist in powered plantarflexion. Preliminary studies show that the state machines for the hip and knee work robustly and that the onset of walking can be detected in less than one gait cycle. Further, it is found that an efficient, underactuated leg exoskeleton can effectively transmit payload forces to the ground during the walking cycle",

One particular case is on prosthetic devices, where the need of \"biofeedback\" is of vital importance to achieve subconscious control of these devices. In order to provide this feedback, so the device can be included into the user's body image, we use electrical stimulation as a substitute for tactile feedback. In this study we analyze the effects of the electrical stimulation together with the intention, provided by the electromyography, for the sensation generation, and its inclusion on the user's body schema. To evaluate our system, we use functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging, to measure the changes in the brain due to the use of an EMG controlled prosthetic hand with electrical stimulation as tactile feedback.",

        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "This paper proposes a new haptic device by using a parallel mechanism and a gimbal mechanism. This device has three legs actuated by 2-DOF gimbal mechanisms, which makes the device simple and light by fixing all the actuators to the base. The reference axis of the gimbal mechanism is rotated about the z axis with 45 degrees, which distributes the end-effector load to each actuator uniformly. Three extra sensors are placed at passive joints to obtain a unique solution for the forward kinematics problem. The proposed haptic device is developed for an operator to use it on a desktop in due consideration of the size of an average Korean person. The proposed haptic device has a small workspace for an operator to use it on a desktop and it has more sensitivity than a serial type haptic device. Therefore, the motors of the proposed haptic device are fixed at the base plate so that the proposed haptic device has a better dynamic bandwidth due to a low moving inertia. With this conceptual design, optimization of the design parameters is carried out by using a genetic algorithm. The objective function is defined by the minimum of the global design indices, the global force/moment isotropy index, the global force/moment payload index, and the workspace. Each global index is calculated by a SVD (singular value decomposition) of the force and moment parts of the jacobian matrix. Division of the jacobian matrix assures a consistency of the units in the matrix. Due to the nonlinearity of this objective function, genetic algorithms are adopted for a global optimization",

When the sensor is transformed by mechanical force, LCR circuit changes in the sensor. In consequence, the sensor is able to detect various kind of tactile information by measuring impedance. In this paper, we focused on LCR circuit formed by distribution of CMCs. By changing CMC weight percent, we made the sensors in which CMCs are in contact and not in contact. First, we analyzed static characteristics of CMC tactile sensor. When the sensor is under unloaded condition, we measured the relationship between frequency of alternating voltage and impedance. As the result, we found that electrical parameters change with CMC weight percent. When the sensor is under transformed condition, we measured relationship between strain and impedance. As the result, we found that impedance changes by deformation of CMC and change in distance between CMCs. Secondly, we analyzed dynamic characteristics of CMC tactile sensor. We measured relationship between mechanical frequency and impedance by exciting vibration on CMC tactile sensor",

In order to perform this, two criterions based on dynamics are proposed: the \"dynamic propulsion criterion\" and the \"dynamic propulsion potential\".

An Ant Colony Optimization (ACO)-based path integration algorihm is developed to solve this problem. Experimental tests are carried out on sample data as well as real world automotive body parts.

The resulting approach is able to produce an initial solution very quickly, then improve the quality of this solution while deliberation time allows.

These machines give satisfying results with regularly spaced parallel tractor trajectories but lead to over and under-applications when geometrical singularities occur (non-parallel paths, start and end of spreading,...). The application errors result then in watercourses pollution and important yield losses. In this study, in order to improve fertilizer application by centrifugal spreading, an optimization problem is considered. The optimal parameters are computed by taking into account the mechanical constraints of the machine so that they can be used as reference variables to control the spreader in the future. Faced with a large scale constrained problem, an augmented Lagrangian algorithm using a 1-bfgs technique is implemented. The improvements provided by this new method are exposed through simulation results for parallel and non parallel paths in the field",

The knee torque would be determined and this would be compared to a sit-to-stand movement without support. The second approach would be called active support and the knee torque would be supported. A motion control algorithm would be proposed such that the support system will move based on the supporting torque. The actual experimentation on both approaches in assisting a sit-to-stand movement will be presented. The experimental result on active support shows the validity of the proposed motion control algorithm",

        "abstract": "In this paper a new assembly process inside a scanning electron microscope (SEM) is demonstrated. The process includes the separation and handling of a silicon nanowire and its bonding to an atomic force microscope (AFM) probe using electron beam induced deposition (EBiD). EBiD is carried out by using the electron beam of the SEM and a flexible mobile microrobot as transporter of the precursor gas. In addition, experiments are presented to investigate mechanical and chemical properties of the bonded nanowire. Real-time object tracking and image processing are used to measure the force applied to the Si-nanowire. In this way, the load and tension stress on the bonds can be calculated. Finally, energy dispersive X-ray (EDX) analysis is applied to the bonds to estimate their chemical composition",

The flexible cantilever is controlled to keep vibrating when an AFM works in the tapping mode. The cantilever is modeled as a flexible beam instead of a point mass system in this paper. The nonlinear interaction force between the tip and sample surface is also modeled. A simulation environment is developed to analyze the dynamics of cantilevers using the flexible beam model. Simulation results confirm that the flexible beam model can represent the system more accurately than the point-mass model. It has been shown that lower modes are more sensitive to changes of surface topography or surface materials when the cantilever is driven to vibrate at a higher harmonic mode. At the same time, this simulation environment also provides a more accurate way to validate the design of a new AFM probe and AFM controller than simulation packages which use the point-mass model",

A biologically motivated attention system detects regions of interest which \"pop-out\" automatically due to strong contrasts and the uniqueness of features. This property makes the regions easily redetectable and thus they are useful candidates for visual landmarks. Matching based on scene prediction and feature similarity allows not only short-term tracking of the regions, but also redetection in loop closing situations. The paper demonstrates how regions are determined and how they are matched reliably. Various experimental results on real-world data show that the landmarks are useful with respect to be tracked in consecutive frames and to enable closing loops",

        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "During a complete running stride, which involves significant periods of flight during which no legs are contacting the ground, a quadruped cannot employ static stability techniques. Instead, the corrective forces necessary to maintain dynamic stability must be applied during the short stance intervals inherent to high-speed running. Because of this complexity and the large coupled forces required to run, much of the research on the control of quadruped running has focused on planar systems which are not required to simultaneously control attitude in all three dimensions. The 3D trot controller presented here overcomes these and other complexities to control a trot up to 3.75 m/s, approximately 3 body lengths per second, and turning rates up to 20 deg/s. The biomimetic method of banking into a high-speed turn is also investigated here. Along with the details of the attitude control algorithm, a set of control principles for high-speed legged motion is presented. These principles, such as the need to counteract the disturbance of swing leg return and the usefulness of force redistribution during stance, are not dependent on a particular scale or actuation scheme and can be applied to a wider range of legged systems",

        "abstract": "At the time of a large-scale urban earthquake disaster, human search activities and information collection are the most important processes of rescue operations. Robots for search and rescue (e.g., aero-robots, crawler type robots) have been studied extensively recently. We have developed a cable driven balloon robot for information acquisition from the sky during disaster rescue and recovery operations. The balloon, from which hang several sensors (sensor unit, SU), uses \"a natural shape balloon\". Three cables connect the SU, and the balloon, with its sensors, is driven by expansion and contraction of the cable length. Cameras and several sensors or wireless relays are loaded onto the SU. The attitude stability of the SU is required to eliminate camera shaking resulting from wind. Such stability is necessary for high-precision information collection because this robot is used in the open air. This study verifies the attitude stability of an SU using a cable arrangement between the balloon and the SU; it statically calculates the movable scope of the SU at an arbitrary wind speed and direction",

This enables the robust measurement of the localization cue values (ITD, UD and IED) in echoic environments. The system is inspired by the auditory system of mammals. It uses a Gammatone filter bank for preprocessing and extracts the ITD and IED cues via zero crossings (UD calculation is straight forward). The mapping between the cue values and the different angles is learned offline which facilitates the adaptation to different head geometries. The performance of the system is demonstrated by localization results for two simultaneous speakers and the mixture of a speaker, music, and fan noise in a normal meeting room. A real time demonstrator of the system is presented in T. Rodemann, et al. (2006)",

This mechanism reduces deployment process in the creation of applications for real sensorized environments. The mechanism consists of 1) dynamic program duplication triggered by matching generation condition with descriptions of components and 2) sensor data selection based on selection conditions and the descriptions. The description, which is called RDF sensor description, is written in resource description framework (RDF) for definition of sensor properties including the knowledge about sensor-attached object. The conditions for RDF sensor description are scripted flexibly with vocabulary of abstract sensor knowledge. Through the conditions, the components are generated dynamically according to change of the sensor composition. The generated components can select needed sensor data in multiple sensor environment. We create sensor services that detect certain behaviors from raw sensor data in our sensing room. The services show generation mechanism's independency on configurations of sensors in deployment of the components in the middleware",

        "abstract": "In this paper, we present a new method for automatic recalibration of the relative pose in a structured light system by a single image of planar surface. Assuming that the intrinsic parameters of the camera and the projector are known from initial calibration, we show that their relative orientation and position can be determined automatically from four projection correspondences in an image and a projection plane. In this method, two steps are taken to solve the pose problem. The advantages are that not only the analytic solutions can be obtained easily but also an over constraint system is constructed in each step to increase the robustness. Some computer simulations and real data experiments have been carried out to validate our method",

BirthSIM is able to simulate the uterine contractions and the mother's voluntary efforts, this enables the operator to synchronize these two types of efforts during a normal childbirth, or to synchronize these two efforts with the operator's tractive instrumental effort during childbirth using obstetric instruments. One originality of the BirthSIM simulator is to allow the medical team to acquire a better understanding of the application of these two synchronization concepts. With the aim of implanting various childbirth procedures, four control algorithms and switching algorithms are used to control successively: force, position, force-velocity or force-position. These control algorithms are important to produce the movement of the head, the mother's natural contractions and the mother's pushing action. Different childbirth cases are simulated using an electropneumatic system. The validity of the proposed control method for simulating childbirth modes has been evaluated by an expert obstetrician",

The combination of a robust homography estimation and of an adaptive thresholding of correlation scores between registered images yields the update of a stochastic grid, that exhibits the horizontal planar areas perceived. This grid allows the integration of data gathered at various altitudes. Results are presented",

        "abstract": "Most robot grippers can hardly be applied to space service due to their devoid of the ability of outputting large force, autonomously making decision and sensing the environment. In this paper, a space underactuated gripper which can stably grasp various objects based on fewer actuators, large force and autonomous decision and multisensory information feedback is introduced. Firstly, the versatile grasping patterns of the gripper with characteristics of underactuation are presented. The multiple sensors are mounted on the gripper including PVDF contact force sensors, a line structure light sensor which detects grasped object approximate shape and volume, and a wrist force sensor which detects the grasped object mass. Secondly, autonomous grasping which is characterized by autonomous decision-making and control is focused on. Control strategies are also proposed to make proper prosthetics and stable grasping according to force sensors information. The grasping rules are extracted from original experiment sample data. Through fuzzy neural network, grasping map is established among comprehensive fuzzy features, including grasping task and object features, and the grasping patterns. Finally, the experimental results demonstrate that the gripper can achieve autonomous and stable grasping",

This approach blocks successively one joint of each parallel mechanism using a simple lockup device and reforms the 3-DOF mechanism to be a 2-DOF one. The parameter errors of the mechanism are identified according to the differences between the sensor output of the redundant chain and nominal model output. Both the condition number and singular value of the error propagation Jacobian are synthesized as a new selection principle of calibration set such that the calibrating process is insensitive to the noise and the calibration precision is increased efficiently. Experiments show that the ratio of maximal error before and after calibrating is 9.6, namely, the setting accuracy of the two mechanisms are increased about 10 times and the error of re-position is less than 0.1 mm and 0.1deg",

The base of the space robot is free-floating for the purpose of safety and saving the fuel. Firstly, the target feature is extracted based on the measured information via the hand-eye camera. Then the target pose (position and orientation) and velocity (linear velocity and angular velocity) relative to the end-effector are estimated using Kalman filtering technology. Thirdly, an autonomous trajectory planning approach is proposed for capturing an space target with unknown motion. Lastly, a semi-physical simulation system is established to verify the planning algorithm. The simulation results show that the algorithm is valid",

        "abstract": "This paper addresses the problem of exploring and mapping an unknown environment using a robot equipped with a stereo vision sensor. The main contribution of our work is a fully automatic mapping system that operates without the use of active ranger sensors (such as laser or sonic transducers), can operate in real-time and can consistently produce accurate maps of large-scale environments. Our approach implements a Rao-Blackwellised particle filter (RBPF) to solve the simultaneous localization and mapping problem and uses efficient data structures for real-time data association, mapping, and spatial reasoning. We employ a hybrid map representation that infers 3D point landmarks from image features to achieve precise localization, coupled with occupancy grids for safe navigation. This paper describes our framework and implementation, and presents our exploration method, and experimental results illustrating the functionality of the system",

An autoregressive model of the fourth order cumulants and the trispectrum function using only the sampled displacement signals were taken to analyze the dynamic characteristics of the magnetorheological (MR) damping device. Modeling and analyzing has been done when a zero mean and non-Gaussian white noise interferes with the vibrant system. The reconstructed bispectra and energy spectra are also presented. The experimental and theoretical results indicate that the time series model and the parametric trispectrum are useful to establish the dynamic model and to analyze the magnetorheological damping system. The measurement and analysis process based on virtual instruments are automatically controlled by computer in this paper",

        "abstract": "An ambitious goal in modern robotic science is to build mobile robots that are able to interact as companions in real world environments. Especially for caretaking of elderly people a system robustly working at private homes is essential, requiring a very natural and human oriented way of communication. Since home environments are usually very individual a first task for a newly acquired robot is to get familiar with its new environment. This paper gives a short overview on how we integrated a vision based localization using the advantages of a very modular architecture and extending a spoken dialog system for online labeling and interaction about different locations. We present results from the integrated system working in a real, fully furnished home environment where it was able to learn the names of different rooms. This system enables us to perform real user studies in future without the need to fall back to Wizard-of-Oz experiments. Ongoing work aims at enabling the robot to take initiative by asking for unknown locations. A future extension is the ability to generalize over features of known rooms to make predictions when encountering unknown rooms",

Due to the under-actuated property of quadrotor helicopter, the controller can set the helicopter track three Cartesian positions (x,y,z) and the yaw angle to their desired values and stabilize the pitch and roll angles. The system has been presented into three interconnected subsystems. The first one representing the under-actuated subsystem, gives the dynamic relation of the horizontal positions (x,y) with the pitch and roll angles. The second fully-actuated subsystem gives the dynamics of the vertical position z and the yaw angle. The last subsystem gives the dynamics of the propeller forces. A backstepping control is presented to stabilize the whole system. The design methodology is based on the Lyapunov stability theory. Various simulations of the model show that the control law stabilizes a quadrotor with good tracking",

        "abstract": "We present an attractor based dynamics that autonomously generates temporally discrete movements and movement sequences stably adapted to changing online sensory information. Autonomous differential equations are used to formulate a dynamical layer with either stable fixed points or a stable limit cycle. A neural competitive dynamics switches between these two regimes according to sensorial context and logical conditions. The corresponding movement states are then converted by simple coordinate transformations into spatial positions of a robot arm. Movement initiation and termination is entirely sensor driven. In this article, the dynamic architecture was changed in order to cope with unreliable sensor information by including this information in the vector field. We apply this architecture to generate timed trajectories for a Puma arm which must catch a moving ball before it falls over a table, and return to a reference position thereafter. Sensory information is provided by a camera mounted on the ceiling over the robot. We demonstrate that the implemented decision-mechanism is robust to noisy sensorial information. Further, a flexible behavior is achieved. Flexibility means that if the sensorial context changes such that the previously generated sequence is no longer adequate, a new sequence of behaviors, depending on the point at which the changed occurred and adequate to the current situation emerges",

        "abstract": "The advancement of multimedia services including audio/visual media has been rapid. The applications of cellular phones, in particular, have increased by using these technologies. In addition, if force telecommunication were realized, force information would become a next leading factor in the multimedia service. In this field, a robotic master/slave system is a leading candidate. This system has been studied as a teleoperation system between an operator and an environment; the operator controls only the master device whereas the slave device is never controlled. For multimedia applications, such systems require flexibility and bidirectionality because force telecommunication must consider the interactions between users. This paper details the fundamental issues of force communication from a viewpoint of human perception. With regard to the control system, this study uses an integrated hybrid control master/slave system that helps to find a key factor of equal bilateral force telecommunication in the sensory aspect. The employed system has a function to change the proportion of force display to position display by varying a weight parameter. We discuss the basic control performance of a force telecommunication system and evaluate qualitative feelings of users by using a psychological evaluation method",

        "abstract": "Many elderly and disabled people today experience difficulties when manoeuvring an electric wheelchair. In order to help these people, several robotic assistance platforms have been devised in the past. In most cases, these platforms consist of separate assistance modes, and heuristic rules are used to automatically decide which assistance mode should be selected in each time step. As these decision rules are often hard-coded and do not take uncertainty regarding the user's intent into account, assistive actions may lead to confusion or even irritation if the user's actual plans do not correspond to the assistive system's behavior. In contrast to previous approaches, this paper presents a more user-centered approach for recognizing the intent of wheelchair drivers, which explicitly estimates the uncertainty on the user's intent. The paper shows the benefit of estimating this uncertainty using experimental results with our wheelchair platform Sharioto",

        "abstract": "This paper describes a method for recognizing the environment and selecting behaviors for a humanoid robot that are appropriate to the environment, based on sensor histories. In order for humanoid robots to move around many kinds of environments, one of the keys is selecting the appropriate behavior. Because features of an environment that deeply influence a robot's motion, such as viscous friction or floor elasticity, are difficult to immediately measure before moving, it is difficult for the robots to plan their behaviors to take these factors into account. Therefore, in our method, a robot first records a long time series of data from sensors attached to its body while performing each behavior in each environment, and it builds decision trees based on this data for each of the behaviors, enabling it to recognize the current environment based on the sensor history. By using the trees, the robot selects the behavior which will be most effective for recognizing the environment, acquires a sensor history while doing the behavior, and selects likely candidates for the environment. By iterating over these steps, the robot can recognize the environment and select an appropriate behavior. To verify the validity of the method, we used a small-size humanoid robot and conducted an experiment to recognize environments in a family's house",

        "abstract": "A team of small, low-cost robots instead of a single large, complex robot is useful in operations such as search and rescue, urban exploration etc. However, the performance of such a team is limited due to the restricted mobility of the team members. This paper presents the results obtained toward the goal of enhancing mobility of a team of mobile robots by physical cooperation among the robots with the focus on the development of the low level system components. Recognizing that small robots need to overcome discrete obstacles, we develop specific analytical maneuvers to negotiate each obstacle where a maneuver is built from a sequence of fundamental cooperative behaviors. We have developed a 2-robot hardware system based on our idea of cooperative mobility improvement and guided by the results from the static analysis. We have demonstrated the implementation of basic cooperative behaviors, such as cooperative lift, and by implementing the decentralized control architecture we have demonstrated gap crossing maneuver with the hardware. We have analytically proved that robot dynamics can be used to reduce the friction requirements in the lift behavior and have demonstrated, with simulations, implementation of this idea for the cooperative lifting behavior",

The belief about a target's next location, as described by a probability density function, is maintained by a recursive Bayesian process that fuses observations with a target motion model. A sensor model that incorporates positive and negative sensor readings allows the single belief function to be used to deliver both searching and tracking behaviors. Constrained non-linear optimization is used to search configuration space for the control action that maximizes the subsequent probability of detection. To demonstrate application of the technique, a simple example is elaborated for a searching and tracking task with an eye-in-hand sensor",

The proposed conceptual model and physical model of the biomimetic control architecture, which are software hardware codesigned, are made up of four blocks, that is information sensing, information communication, behavior generation, and joint driver blocks. Furthermore, the architecture model can realize the evolution between different behavior control layers based various behaviour manners.

        "abstract": "This paper presents a biologically inspired approach to multimodal integration and decision-making in the context of human-robot interactions. More specifically, we address the principle of ideomotor compatibility by which observing the movements of others influences the quality of one's own performance. This fundamental human ability is likely to be linked with human imitation abilities, social interactions, the transfer of manual skills, and probably to mind reading. We present a robotic control model capable of integrating multimodal information, decision making, and replicating a stimulus-response compatibility task, originally designed to measure the effect of ideomotor compatibility on human behavior. The model consists of a neural network based on the dynamic field approach, which is known for its natural ability for stimulus enhancement as well as cooperative and competitive interactions within and across sensorimotor representations. Finally, we discuss how the capacity for ideomotor facilitation can provide the robot with human-like behavior, but at the expense of several disadvantages, such as hesitation and even mistakes",

        "abstract": "Advanced autonomous artificial systems will need incremental learning and adaptive abilities similar to those seen in humans. Knowledge from biology, psychology and neuro-science is now inspiring new approaches for systems that have sensory-motor capabilities and operate in complex environments. Eye/hand coordination is an important cross-modal cognitive function, and is also typical of many of the other coordinations that must be involved in the control and operation of embodied intelligent systems. This paper examines a biologically inspired approach for incrementally constructing compact mapping networks for eye/hand coordination. We present a simplified node-decoupled extended Kalman filter for radial basis function networks, and compare this with other learning algorithms. An experimental system consisting of a robot arm and a pan-and-tilt head with a color camera is used to produce results and test the algorithms in this paper. We also present three approaches for adapting to structural changes during eye/hand coordination tasks, and the robustness of the algorithms under noise are investigated. The learning and adaptation approaches in this paper have similarities with current ideas about neural growth in the brains of infants during early cognitive development",

The simulated robot can walk successfully by changing its walking speed as the side effect of the auxiliary ZMP control",

        "abstract": "When setting up a sensor network, one of the first requirements is to establish cryptographic keys to provide encrypted communication links. However, the traditional key establishment techniques cannot be directly applied due to the inherent properties of sensor networks. Recently, several random key pre-distribution schemes based on symmetric cryptography have been proposed to solve the key establishment issue of sensor networks. In this paper, we propose a framework, Blom-based Q-composite (BBQ) scheme, which generalizes various random key pre-distribution schemes. With the aid of BBQ, we systematically analyze, characterize, and discuss the properties of various random key pre-distribution schemes, including connectivity, scalability and security",

The hypothesis that varying leg takeoff angles can lead to regulation of forward speed of the bounding gait is presented and verified. In addition, comparisons are made between the bounding gait which uses active wheel control and bounding which uses passive mechanical blocking of the wheels",

        "abstract": "This paper introduces a novel type of actuator that is investigated by ESA for force-reflection to a wearable exoskeleton. The actuator consists of a DC motor that is relocated from the joint by means of Bowden cable transmissions. The actuator shall support the development of truly ergonomic and compact wearable man-machine interfaces. Important Bowden cable transmission characteristics are discussed, which dictate a specific hardware design for such an actuator. A first prototype is shown, which was used to analyze these basic characteristics of the transmissions and to proof the overall actuation concept. A second, improved prototype is introduced, which is currently used to investigate the achievable performance as a master actuator in a master-slave control with force-feedback. Initial experimental results are presented, which show good actuator performance in a 4 channel control scheme with a slave joint. The actuator features low movement resistance in free motion and can reflect high torques during hard contact situations. High contact stability can be achieved. The actuator seems therefore well suited to be implemented into the ESA exoskeleton for space-robotic telemanipulation.",

        "abstract": "Controlling devices using physiological signals is an increasingly active research field in human-robot interaction. Using brain signals, or Electroencephalograms (EEG), to control devices is widely known as Brain-Computer Interfacing (BCI). In a BCI system, brain signals are used to directly control devices and not as a communication channel, so target applications are restricted to handicapped and aged people. On the other hand, it is possible for healthy people to simply control devices using voice and body movements. In this paper, quantifying human's state of mind and emotions is investigated by analyzing changes in brain activity. The existence of a relation between robots' bodily expressions and their impressions on the observer is demonstrated. We also show a correlation between the nature of the expression and the power of the low-alpha channel in brain signals. Robots can make use of this quantification as an extra channel of information to achieve smoother and more human-like adaptive interaction",

        "abstract": "Autonomous service robots have to recognize and interpret their environment to be able to interact with it. This paper focuses on service tasks such as serving a glass of water where a humanoid two-arm-system has to acquire an object from the scene. A task planner should be able to autonomously discern the necessary actions to solve the task. In the process, a path planner can be used to compute motion sequences to execute these actions. To plan trajectories, the path planner requires a pair of configurations, the start and the goal configuration of the robot, to be provided e.g. by a task planner. This paper proposes a method to autonomously find the goal configurations necessary to acquire objects from the scene and thus makes an attempt to bridge the gap between task planning and path planning. The method determines where to grasp an object by analyzing the scene and the influence of obstacles on the intended grasp location. For the case where the goal object can not be grasped due to obstructing obstacles, a solution is proposed",

        "abstract": "Human interaction with a service robot requires a shared representation of the environment for spoken dialogue and task specification where names used for particular locations are depending on personal preferences. A question is how such human oriented models can be tied to the geometric robotic models needed for precise localisation and navigation. We assume that this integration can be based on the information potential users give to a service robot about its working environment. We further believe that this information is best given in an interactive setting (a \"guided tour\") in this particular environment. This paper presents a pilot study that investigates how humans present a familiar environment to a mobile robot. The study is set up within our concept of human augmented mapping, for which we assume an initial \"guided tour\" scenario to teach a robot its environment. Results from this pilot study are used to validate a proposed generic environment model for a service robot",

        "abstract": "Reactive mobile robot navigation based on potential field methods has shown to be a good solution for dealing with both unknown and dynamic environments, where timely responses are required. Unfortunately, the complexity of the tasks which can be successfully carried out is restricted by the inherent shortcomings of the approach such as trapping situations due to local minima, difficulties passing among closely spaced obstacles, oscillations in narrow corridors, etc. The first of the aforementioned limitations was fully overcome in J. Antich and A. Ortiz (2005) by applying the two new principles of traversability and tenacity in the context of artificial potential fields. As a result, navigation was achieved in very difficult scenarios, even including maze-like environments. In this paper, continuing that previous work, it is intended to step forward by ensuring, whenever possible, that the target point is attained for any mission, setting, at the same time, an upper bound regarding the length of the resultant robot's path",

In this approach, an extended multi-input and multi-output orthogonal forward selection algorithm based on the leave-one-out criterion is applied for the construction of radial basis function (RBF) networks with tunable nodes. This algorithm is computationally efficient and is capable of identifying parsimonious RBF networks that generalize well. Moreover, the proposed algorithm is fully automatic and the user does not need to specify a termination criterion for the construction process. The constructed parsimonious multi-input and multi-output RBF network can complete camera calibration automatically and rapidly, and the simulation has proved that the approach is feasible",

To illustrate the performance of new controllers family, time-real experimental results on a two degrees of freedom direct-drive arm are also presented",

The simulation results also correspond to the experimental ones with actuation at the base joint. Observations on the simulation results is derived to reveal a better casting actuation to succeed in winding to an object.

It will be shown how any analytic matrix function like exponential, logarithm and more complicated expressions in robotics, can be easily and analytically calculated in an explicit form. Examples are given for the exponential map, inverse of the exponential map, and the derivative of the exponential map. For the first two examples there exist well known expressions in the literature, but the last one is not as easy to compute without the presented methods",

In order to be useful for model-based control techniques onboard the robot, the model had to have low computing requirements, yet be complex enough to capture the transient response of the robot. To achieve this, a system identification approach was taken by first capturing the robot response to various inputs, and then matching them to a simple model",

        "abstract": "This paper aims at investigating and characterizing force behavior and mechanical properties of living drosophila embryos using an in situ modeled PVDF (polyvinylidene fluoride) piezoelectric microforce sensing tool with a resolution in the range of sub-muN. Drosophila embryo is one of the most studied organisms in biological research, medical research, genetics and developmental biology, and has implications in the cure of human diseases. In order to achieve high efficiency and accuracy during microinjection of genetic material into a drosophila embryo, it is absolutely necessary to allow close monitoring of the magnitude and direction of microinjection forces acting on the embryo during injection. In this paper, a microrobotic biomanipulation platform integrating a two-axis (2-D) modeled PVDF micro-force sensor is used to implement force sensing during microinjection of living drosophila embryos. Micro injection forces and membrane deformation of embryos in different stages of embryogenesis are found. Ultimately, the technology will provide a critical and major step towards the development of automated biomanipuation for batch microinjection of living embryos in genetics",

In this paper a closed loop position control of the knee joint actuated by the quadriceps muscle to perform flexion-extension has been presented. The feedback control consists of a model predictive control (MPC) technique which is also known by a receding horizon control or moving horizon control. This controller is applied to a complex physio-mathematical muscle model that is based on a macroscopic Hill and a microscopic Huxley concepts. An MPC constitutes an adequate controller with nonlinear multivariable systems. Furthermore it enables us to incorporate explicitly constraints on inputs, outputs and system states. The controller has shown a robustness against force perturbation and model mismatch as well as high capability of tracking a pre-defined reference trajectory",

CRE aims at enabling a robot to be capable of dependable and robust recognition and decision under a high level of uncertainty and ambiguity in perception. This paper improves the performance of CRE based on the following expansion: 1) the provision of an evidence structure separately from the internal perceptual processes represented by a precedence graph, such that the contribution of individual evidences to the certainty of the premise pertaining to the given robotic mission can be more clearly defined, and 2) the establishment of a search process for action behaviors based on the overall contribution of the chosen action behaviors to the certainty of the premise pertaining to the given robotic mission. CRE is applied to the two robotic missions, caller identification and caller following, and is evaluated by actual experimentation. The experimental results show the expanded version of CRE results in improvement not only in dependability but also in stability",

In the absence of external sensing, relative motions between robot and human are not predictable and unexpected collisions may occur at any location along the robot arm. Based on physical quantities such as total energy and generalized momentum of the robot manipulator, we present an efficient collision detection method that uses only proprioceptive robot sensors and provides also directional information for a safe robot reaction after collision. The approach is first developed for rigid robot arms and then extended to the case of robots with elastic joints, proposing different reaction strategies. Experimental results on collisions with the DLR-III lightweight manipulator are reported",

A new design of collision detector with tunable accuracy, defined by a linear inequality for easily computed and updated parameters, is presented. It utilizes and tracks a measure of proximity/penetration between two objects in the direction of shortest path between two inner ellipsoids. Moreover, it does not incur additional computational expenses since no costly updating process and heavy dependence on the geometric details of the deformed polyhedral objects is needed, so that the efficiency is comparable to that of rigid cases. Numerical experiments on pairs of randomly scaling convex polyhedra, lacking geometry coherence, demonstrated that the efficiency of the new collision detector is comparable to the rigid case",

In the final descent phase, cancellation of the horizontal speed relative to the surface of the landing site is essential. This paper describes various kinds of robotics technologies applied for MUSES-C mission. An autonomous descent scheme and a novel visual navigation system are proposed and presented in detail.

Virtual head robot tracking and three-point l-l controllers incorporated with reactive control schemes are proposed here to overcome the cases when the control law is undefined and subject to potential inter-robot collision. In order for the whole group to enter a desired formation, a general procedure is suggested in the initialisation stage. Advantages of our approach include the establishment and maintenance of any formation from arbitrary initial conditions with collision avoidance for a large group of mobile robots. The approach is validated through simulation cases to illustrate the capability of handling singularities and avoiding collision in a group of N robots",

Regarding vertices of polygonal obstacles as input points of the Delaunay triangulations, a Delaunay-based path planning is proposed to determine an optimal waypoint path while considering criterions of minimum fuel expenditure and collision risk. A trajectory generation method with corresponding optimal constraints is further developed to yield feasible fly trajectory along the planned path. The off-line pre-planning and on-line updated planning are integrated to enhance autonomy of vehicles flying in dangerous situations, with tight maneuvering and operational capability. Simulation results of a mission scenario are finally presented to demonstrate effectiveness of the proposed approach",

        "abstract": "Color segmentation takes a great attention because color is an effective and robust visual cue for characterizing an object from the others. However, color segmentation suffers from color variations incurred by irregular illumination changes. We propose a reliable color modeling approach in HSI (hue-saturation-intensity) color space while considering intensity information by adopting the B-spline curve fitting to make a mathematical model for statistical characteristics of a color with respect to intensity. It is based on the fact that color distribution of a single-colored object is not invariant with respect to brightness variations even in the HS (hue-saturation) plane. The statistical characteristics contain the mean and standard deviation of hue and saturation with respect to intensity. They are mathematically expressed as four bar graphs. In order to fit the bar graphs to continuous curves, we use B-spline curve fitting procedure. From several experimental results, we verify that the proposed algorithm is successfully applied to color segmentation under various illumination conditions",

The agents have limited capabilities, including local sensing and rule-based reactive control only, and operate without centralized coordination. We define the spatiotemporal constraints necessary for the ordered assembly of a structure and give a procedure for encoding these constraints in a rule set, such that production of the desired structure is guaranteed. Our main contribution is a stochastic optimization algorithm which is able to significantly reduce the number of environmental features that an agent must recognize to build a structure. Experiments show that our optimization algorithm outperforms existing techniques",

Moreover, it does not require to switch the control modes during the transition between the free space motion and the constrained motion.

        "abstract": "A general solution for image-based object recognition and localization is still a goal far away. Therefore, the only way to tackle the problem is to apply the suitable approach for each specific problem. The most common techniques can be classified into global appearance-based, model-based, or histogram-based approaches, and approaches based on local features. In this paper, we concentrate on recognition and full 6D localization of solid colored objects of any geometry for real-time application on a humanoid robot system. State-of-the-art model-based methods can only deal with object geometries which can be broken down into 3D lines and planes, and thus can be efficiently projected into the image plane, which is not the case for most objects in a realistic scenario. In contrast, appearance-based methods have the power to be applicable for any object geometry, but are rarely combined with full 6D localization of objects, which is required for any realistic application in the context of grasping with a humanoid robot. We present a system which combines the benefits of global appearance-based and model-based approaches, resulting in a system which can acquire object representations automatically given its 3D model, and can recognize and localize solid-colored objects in 6D in an arbitrary scene in real-time",

The two algorithms are A* and RRT-Connect. A* has often been used for self-reconfiguration planning on different systems, but so far no work has been done to show that A* is an optimal or even a good choice for this task. The RRT-connect algorithm is adopted from traditional robot motion planning and is easily adapted to self-reconfiguration planning. The results show that RRT-connect is significantly faster than A* for difficult self-reconfiguration problems. In most cases RRT-connect generates longer paths that A* it is, however, possible to optimize the paths from RRT-connect by a simple and efficient method such that the difference is negligible",

The results derived by the semantic differential (SD) method and the direct questioning show that each presenter has different functional advantages. We infer that on-screen agent and robot can complement each other in presentations",

It is based on a static 2D approach that includes optimization of the wheel torques in order to minimize the required friction which is an important performance metric. The evaluation comprises well known rover concepts and new suspension systems. The performance of the systems is compared and interesting effects of some concepts are discussed in more detail including torques and load distribution. The rovers MER (NASA) and CRAB (EPFL) show good performance which is topped only by the eight wheeled DoubleSpring system",

        "abstract": "The accelerations of and forces among contacting rigid bodies may be computed by formulating the dynamics equations and contact constraints as a complementarity problem (P. Lotstedt, 1981). Dantzig's algorithm, when applicable, will find a solution to the linear complementarity problem corresponding to an assembly with n contacts in O(n) major cycles. Can the dynamics of an assembly be computed more quickly if the dynamics of a subassembly are already known? This paper shows that Dantzig's algorithm will find a solution in O(n - k) major cycles if the algorithm is initialized with a solution to the dynamics problem for a subassembly with k internal contacts. We apply this observation to two robotics problems: dynamic simulation and assembly sequence planning. In dynamic simulation, the positions of several bodies might remain fixed during a sequence of frames. We compute the dynamics of this motionless subset (which might not be motionless when considered in isolation), and use the result to initialize the computation for the entire assembly. In assembly planning, non-disjoint sets of objects are typically considered sequentially by the planner. If the configuration of only one body is varied, the dynamics of successive assemblies can be computed in a constant number of major cycles",

We teach the motions through a series of move commands for a task, and these commands are stored in a task knowledge database. The taught positions of the motions are expressed as task object coordinates. This paper describes the architecture and the performance of the CG simulator system, and provides an example of maintenance tasks.

The arm wrestling robot (AWR) is intended to play arm wrestling game with real human on a table for entertainment. The designing scenario of the prototype model's hardware is performed. Elbow/wrist force sensors, as a crucial device in the force sensing system, are described in details. Software is developed for device driven and interface. The surface electromyographic (EMG) signals from the upper limb are sampled when a real player competes with the force testing system. By using the method of wavelet packet transformation (WPT), the high-frequency noises can be eliminated effectively and the characteristics of EMG signals can be extracted. Artificial neural network is adopted to estimate the elbow joint torque. The effectiveness of the humanoid algorithm using torque control estimated via WRT and neural network is confirmed by experiments",

The aim of the robot reconfiguration is to generate better configuration with respect to the directional locomotion adapted to the environment. Module state vector (MSV) and configuration state matrix (CSM) are presented and constructed for representing the asymmetric module and the configurations, and supporting the transformation operation for triggering the elementary motions of the module and the reconfiguration.

        "abstract": "This paper presents an analysis of the extended Kalman filter formulation of simultaneous localisation and mapping (EKF-SLAM). We show that the algorithm produces very optimistic estimates once the \"true\" uncertainty in vehicle heading exceeds a limit. This failure is subtle and cannot, in general, be detected without ground-truth, although a very inconsistent filter may exhibit observable symptoms, such as disproportionately large jumps in the vehicle pose update. Conventional solutions - adding stabilising noise, using an iterated EKF or unscented filter, etc., - do not improve the situation. However, if \"small\" heading uncertainty is maintained, EKF-SLAM exhibits consistent behaviour over an extended time-period. Although the uncertainty estimate slowly becomes optimistic, inconsistency can be mitigated indefinitely by applying tactics such as batch updates or stabilising noise. The manageable degradation of small heading variance SLAM indicates the efficacy of submap methods for large-scale maps",

        "abstract": "The odometry information used in localization can be quite erroneous when the robot follows the curved path or suffers from slippage. Thus the use of the low-cost gyroscope to compensate for an angular error is considered by many researchers. Conventional Kalman filtering methods that fuse the odometry with the gyroscope may produce infeasible solution because the robot parameters are estimated regardless of their physical constraints. In this paper, we propose a constrained Kalman filtering method that applies general constrained optimization technique to the estimation of the robot parameters. The state observability is improved by the additional state variables and the accuracy is also improved by the nonapproximated Kalman filter design. Experimental results show the proposed method effectively compensates for the odometry error and yields feasible parameter estimation at the same time",

        "abstract": "This paper describes multi-agent strategies for applying continuous and embedded learning (CEL). In the CEL architecture, an agent maintains a simulator based on its current knowledge of the world and applies a learning algorithm that obtains its performance measure using this simulator. The simulator is updated to reflect changes in the environment or robot state that can be detected by a monitor, such as sensor failures. In this paper, we adapt this architecture to a multi-agent setting in which the monitor is communicated among the team members effectively creating a distributed monitor. The parameters of the current control algorithm (in our case rulebases learned by genetic algorithms) used by all of the agents are added to the monitor as well, allowing for cooperative learning. We show that communication of agent status (e.g. failures) among the team members allows the agents to dynamically adapt to team properties, in this case team size. Furthermore, we show that an agent is able to switch between specializing within a section of the domain when there are many team members and generalizing to other parts of the domain when the rest of the team members are disabled. Finally, we also discuss future potential of this method, most notably in the creation of a distributed case based reasoning system in which the cases are actual genetic algorithm population members that can be swapped among team members",

There has been many researches to control robot actuated by pneumatic muscles, but conventional theories are hard to apply on real robot plants because of their assumptions and disregards of pneumatic muscle's physical aspects like size of pneumatic muscle and its controller. Here, the new method for saving space which is occupied by many controllers to operate robot actuated by pneumatic muscles is proposed. Actually there is easy way to control pneumatic muscle using the commercial proportional pressure regulator, but its size is not suitable to be embedded on stand alone robot. So, new method using the pressure switches of compact size and encoders is suggested. This new method is tested on a robot link with ball joints, actuated by four pneumatic muscles",

        "abstract": "In this paper, considering Space Free-Flyer Robots as highly nonlinear coupled systems, a chattering avoidance sliding mode controller is developed with confined computational burden for on-line implementations. A regulating routine is proposed to determine proper positive values for the coefficient of sliding condition. In addition, to reduce the computational cost for on-line applications, an explicit direct relationship between the SFFR's actuators (force/torque) demands and measurement of distances from the corresponding sliding surfaces is proposed. Then this model is optimally parameterized using Prediction Error Method (PEM). Also, to achieve an acceptable performance, the parameters are estimated recursively using Kalman Filter as a parameter estimator. To this end, first an explicit dynamics model of a 14-DOF SFFR is derived via SPACEMAPLE where Recursive PEM method is used for parameterization of the SFFR model. Then, based on the estimated dynamics, a multi input sliding mode control law is applied to the given SFFR to catch a moving target. To evaluate the new proposed algorithm in a more complicated condition, it is assumed that for controlling the base of SFFR only on-off actuators are available, which can just generate a constant positive or negative force/torque. The obtained results show that the proposed regulated sliding mode controller can significantly alleviate the chattering trend, and consequently energy consumption will be substantially decreased as well as reduced computational burden with reasonable running time duration for on-line implementations.",

By suspending the base plate by six linearly independent wires, the plate doesn't swing even if the reaction forces are applied to the plate from the moving manipulator. However, if the reaction forces become too large due to fast motion, some wires become loose and the base plate may turn over. To avoid the overturn, two ways to exploit the redundancy of the manipulator are proposed and their effectiveness is verified by simulations and experiments",

        "abstract": "For humanoid robots which are able to assist humans in their daily life, the capability for adequate interaction with human operators is a key feature. If one considers that more than 60% of human communication is conducted non-verbally (by using facial expressions and gestures), an important research topic is how interfaces for this non-verbal communication can be developed. To achieve this goal, several robotic heads have been designed. However, it remains unclear how exactly such a head should look like and what skills it should have to be able to interact properly with humans. This paper describes an approach that aims at answering some of these design choices. A behavior-based control to realize facial expressions which is a basic ability needed for interaction with humans is presented. Furthermore a poll in which the generated facial expressions should be detected is visualized. Additionally, the mechatronical design of the head and the accompanying neck joint are given",

        "abstract": "On Oct 24, 2005, Hurricane Wilma made landfall at Cape Romano, Florida. Two days later, the Center for Robot-Assisted Search and Rescue (CRASAR) deployed an iSENSYS helicopter and an unmanned surface vehicle to survey damage in parts of Marco Island, 11 miles from landfall. Assistance was provided by the National Science Foundation's industry/university cooperative research center on safety security rescue technologies. The AEOS-1 USV was prototype built for environmental science studies. It was modified to carry a Sound Metric Dual frequency IDentification SONar (DIDSON). The DIDSON was able to show the state of underwater structures, schools of small fish swimming, and find the railings from the collapsed section of a pier. This work validates the concept of using USVs and UAVs together for disaster response, suggests missions, and priorities for autonomy. Besides damage inspection, USV-UAV teams can find safe lanes of sea travel and to detect hazardous materials spills. In addition to providing situation awareness, the UAV can serve as a wireless network relay. Inspection of damage to seawalls, docks, and bridges requires vision above the waterline as well as below poses a new type of Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM).",

A miniature vehicle is developed based on the COTS-BOTS robot and an overhead vision system is used to localize the vehicles. The single lane tracking control algorithm is described first. To control multiple vehicles to drive through an intersection without collision, a distributed cooperative driving algorithm is developed, which is based on velocity planning using search algorithms in the corresponding coordination diagram. Experimental results verify our proposed approach and we believe this platform can serve as a cost-effective testbed to study vehicle-to-vehicle communication based cooperative driving in intelligent transportation systems",

The algorithm is specially designed for a distributed system with a large number of robots, all of which should be able to reach their respective goal positions without blocking each other, even if the environment is heavily constricted by obstacles. The basic idea of the approach is based on fully distributed path planning without any central instance, but with the ability of communication and cooperation between the robots. Path planning is done on local sections of the time-space configuration space. Dynamic conflicts between the robots are solved by the heuristic adjustment of priority values. By a continuous enhancement of all plans the algorithm is very robust against dynamic changes and erroneous robot behavior",

In our previous paper, we proposed a path planning algorithm based on a random sampling for the sake of the multi-agent cooperation. However, the action path of the robots is liable to be deviated by the noise in the real world. Thus, some correction mechanism is required to reduce the differences between the planned path and the real one. In this paper, we propose a re-planning method to solve the above-mentioned difficulty. The applicability of this method is confirmed with the experiment using two humanoid robots, in which they have re-generated path plans according to their locations detected by their own cameras",

Such control is not always easy, however, as the viewpoint of the human, the alignment of the input device, and the local coordinate frame of the robot are rarely all aligned. These discrepancies force the user to reconcile the involved coordinate frames during teleoperation. Therefore, the choice of coordinate frames is critical since an unintuitive coordinate frame mapping will likely lead to higher mental workload and reduced efficiency. We discuss this concern, describe the various difficulties involved with natural remote teleoperation of a robot, and report experiments that demonstrate the effects of using different frames of reference on task performance and user mental workload",

        "abstract": "This paper considers a group of mobile autonomous agents moving in the space with a virtual leader. We investigate the dynamic properties of the group for the case where the topology of the neighboring relations between agents varies with time and the coupling matrix is asymmetric. We introduce a set of switching control laws that enable the group to generate the desired stable flocking motion. The control laws are a combination of attractive/repulsive and alignment forces, and the control law acting on each agent relies on the state information of its neighbors and the external reference signal (or \"virtual leader\"). When the velocity damping is taken into account, we can appropriately modify the control laws to generate the same stable flocking motion. Numerical simulations are worked out to further illustrate our theoretical results",

Roughly speaking, the coverage diameter of a polygon is the longest possible distance between two points through which the polygon cannot pass in between. The primary use of coverage diameter is to form a cage for transporting an object, not necessarily convex, with multiple disc-shaped robots. The main idea of the computation of coverage diameter is to convert the problem into a graph structure, then perform the search for a solution path in that graph. The proposed algorithm runs in O(n2 log n) time for the input polygon with n vertices",

We use our reachability roadmap method to compute an initial, resolution complete roadmap. This roadmap is small which keeps query times and memory consumption low. However, for use in virtual environments, there are additional criteria that must be satisfied. In particular, we require that the roadmap contains useful cycles. These provide short paths and alternative routes which allow for variation in the routes a moving object can take. We will show how to incorporate such cycles. In addition, we provide high-clearance paths by retracting the edges of the roadmap to the medial axis. Since all operations are performed in a preprocessing phase, high-quality paths can be extracted in real-time as is required in interactive applications",

The result of DP is compressed to an arbitrary size of control policy by our vector quantization (VQ) method. A chaotic but performable control policy can be obtained in the global state space of the Acrobot by DP. Moreover, we can verify that our VQ algorithm can reduce the dimension of the control policy from four to two in the process of compression",

        "abstract": "Reliable data association is crucial to localization and map building for mobile robot applications. For that reason, many mobile robots tend to choose vision-based SLAM solutions. In this paper, a SLAM scheme based on visual object recognition, not just a scene matching, in home environment is proposed without using artificial landmarks. For the object-based SLAM, the following algorithms are suggested: 1) a novel local invariant feature extraction by combining advantages of multi-scale Harris corner as a detector and its SIFT descriptor for natural object recognition, 2) the RANSAC clustering for robust object recognition in the presence of outliers and 3) calculating accurate metric information for SLAM update. The proposed algorithms increase robustness by correct data association and accurate observation. Moreover, it also can be easily implemented real-time by reducing the number of representative landmarks, i.e. objects. The performance of the proposed algorithm was verified by experiments using EKF-SLAM with a stereo camera in home-like environments, and it showed that the final pose error was bounded after battery-run-out autonomous navigation for 50 minutes",

For each joint subsystem, a robust tracking controller is designed in two steps: first, a nominal controller is designed for the nominal plant to get desired tracking performance, then a robust compensator is added to restrain the influence of the perturbation, that is the difference of the real plant from the nominal plant. The controller designed by the proposed method is a linear time-invariant one. It is shown that by applying the controller with a sufficiently wide frequency bandwidth robust output tracking property can be achieved in the contact phase while a new contact of the motor with the load in the correct direction is ensured in the backlash phase. An important feature of the method is that the controller parameters can be tuned on-line easily",

First, we consider the structure from motion problem using imaged 3D lines (conics). Polar lines of the principal point with respect to the conic curves are exploited to estimate a generic homography matrix from which a partial Euclidean reconstruction is obtained. The polar lines and the information extracted from the homography are then used to design a control law which allow us to fully decouple rotational motions from translational motions",

This paper is concerned with robust stabilization and controller design for uncertain systems with interval time-varying state and input delays. The system uncertainties under consideration are unknown and time-varying, but norm-bounded. The time delays vary in intervals. A robust stabilization condition and an associated controller are constructed by solving two linear matrix inequalities (LMIs). The auxiliary variables and generalized states methods are used to prove the asymptotic stability of the system. In the proposed control design, there are no restrictions on the derivatives of the time delays, allowing fast time-varying delays. Examples and simulation results have confirmed the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed method",

It uses three piezo-electric actuators and two types of flexure joints, one is a revolute joint and the other is a ball joint, as its main mechanism. The problem of inverse kinematics between end effector position and actuator displacements along with the Jacobian matrix for this design is derived. A glass needle of 3 to 10 cm length is used as the end effector to increase the workspace of the micro/nano manipulator. As the length of the glass needle end effector is decreased, the resolution and accuracy of the manipulator is increased while the workspace volume is decreased. The design parameters are optimally chosen so that the manipulator will obtain maximum workspace volume. The simulation results illustrate that the proposed model has a large workspace and in the same time it will be small in size using the proposed architecture",

This paper presents a novel shape-shifting mobile robot system named as Amoeba II (A-II) for the urban search and rescue application. It has been designed with three degrees of freedom (DOFs) and two tracked drive systems. This robot consists of two modular mobile units and a joint unit. The mobile unit is a tracked mechanism to enforce the propulsion of robot. The joint unit can transform the robot shape for getting high mobility. A-II robot not only can adapt to the environment but also can change its body corresponding to locus space. It behaves two states including the parallel state (named as II state) and the linear state (named as I state). The parallel state enables the robot with high mobility on rough ground. With the linear state the robot can climb upstairs and go through narrow space such as the pipe, cave etc. Also, the joint unit can propel the robot to roll in sidewise direction. Especially, two modular A-II robots can be connected through jointing common interfaces on the joint unit to compose a stronger shape-shifting robot, which can transform the body into four wheels-driven vehicle. Finally, the elementary experimental results validate the adaptation and its mobility",

The humanoid robot developed herein comprises mainly a wheeled mobile base, a fixed torso mounted on a mobile base, two 7 DOF robot arms, two 7 DOF robot hands and one 5 DOF robotic binocular head. A coordinated visually guided control structure is then proposed for this humanoid robot. Image processing algorithms are also proposed to increase the perception capability of rapidly detecting the location of a target object in a natural environment, thus reducing the computational burden for image processing. Finally, one experiment is conducted to verify the theoretical derivations and the performance of the humanoid robot. Three objects, i.e., a rectangular parallelepiped, a cup with a handle and a bottle-shaded container with square bottom, are placed on a table, with one selected as the target object. Experimental results indicate that the robotic head and the robot arm of the humanoid robot can coordinate with each other to locate and grasp the target object successfully.",

The robot is capable of passive roll and pitch stabilization against small disturbances while actively stabilizing the yaw and the altitude. We achieve omnidirectional horizontal motion by shifting the center of gravity. The structure is made out of lightweight polyurethane and carbon fiber. Preliminary tests show that \"CoaX\" is able to hover for short moments and the lateral control is effective",

Actuators are assigned to particular action units of the facial action coding system (FACS). Emotion states represented by the circumplex model of affect are mapped to individual action units. Thereby, continuous, dynamic, and realistic emotion state transitions are achieved. EDDIE is largely developed and manufactured in a rapid-prototyping process. Miniature off-the-shelf mechatronics components are used providing high functionality at low-cost. Evaluations conducted in a user-study show that emotions can be recognized very well. Further experiments show that additional features adapted from animals have significant but small influence on the display of the human emotion 'disgust'",

In this paper, a medical treatment robot is proposed for ankle joint rehabilitation exercises, in which the 3-RSS/S parallel mechanism is adopted based on the ankle joint's movements. The mechanical design is described and the inverse kinematic is derived, as a result, the Jacobian matrix is obtained. Furthermore, a reality model of the robot is built by UG and simulated under the ADMS environment. It shows the design can meet the needs of ankle joint rehabilitation movements. In order to validate these concepts, the first prototype is developed that driven by three torque motors and equipped with force sensor for sensing the interaction force between patient's foot and robot. At last, the robot's control system is presented in the paper",

First, the general task to be performed by such a robot is defined, and variant kinematic mechanisms to form the basic structure of the robot will be discussed. Choosing an appropriate mechanism, geometric dimensions, and mass properties will be detailed to develop a dynamics model for the system. Next, the strength of each component is analyzed to finalize its shape. To complete the design procedure, Patran/Nastran was used to apply the finite element method for strength analysis of complicated parts. Also, ADAMS was used to model the mechanisms, where 3D sketch of each component of the robot was generated by means of Solidworks, and several sets of equations governing the dimensions of system were solved using Matlab. Finally, the components are fabricated and assembled together with controlling hardware. Two main processors are used within the control system of the robot. The operator's PC as the master processor and the laptop installed on the robot as the slave processor. The performance of the system was demonstrated in Rescue robot league of RoboCup 2005 in Osaka (Japan) and achieved the 2nd best design award.",

Despite this, our method can lead to high accuracy gripping suitable for e.g. industrial assembly. Our concept is to augment a simple parallel gripper by mounting a set of object specific jaws. Given the right shapes these jaws enable the gripper to automatically align the object, and thereby compensate for errors in the original object pose estimation. We introduce a couple of automatic and semi-automatic design strategies for deriving these shapes and describe how these can be verified by simulations using rigid body dynamics. The output of our system is a CAD model for the jaws. We prove our concept with a number of experiments, which are also used to verify the coherence between the simulation and real world",

        "abstract": "Due to their monolithic construction and superior wear and loss properties, flexure joints have been used to reduce the mechanism size and increase the positioning accuracy. The compliance of flexure joints, however, can affect the static and dynamic characteristics of the overall mechanism. To design mechanisms containing flexure joints, we have proposed a multi-objective optimization approach to take into account the multitude of performance metrics and design constraints. A Pareto frontier is first computed, and secondary design criteria, such as sensitivity and dynamic characteristics, are then applied to select the final design. To reduce the computation load and facilitate design iteration, a lumped spring approximation, the Paros-Weisbord model, is used to characterize the flexure joints and the pseudo-rigid-body model is used as an approximate description of mechanisms. This paper presents this approach applied to the design of a micro-gripper. The performance metrics are chosen to be the manipulability of the gripper opening and the decoupling of a stiffness matrix (reflecting the remote center of compliance criterion). Different design and initial fabrication results are included",

        "abstract": "This paper presents a mixed fuzzy-GA controller (MFGAC) for trajectory tracking of an industrial selective compliance assembly robot arm (SCARA), which is one of the most employed manipulators in industrial environments. In this robot nonlinear effects due to centrifugal, coriolis and internal forces are more important than friction and gravity forces, unlike most industrial robots. The control procedure of MFGAC is consisting of a mixed fuzzy controller which is optimized by genetic algorithm. In this work we first design a traditional fuzzy controller (TFC) from the viewpoint of a single-input single-output (SISO) system for controlling each degree of freedom of the robot. Then, an appropriate coupling fuzzy controller is also designed according to the characteristics of robot's dynamic coupling and incorporated into a TFC. After that by using genetic algorithm we tune and optimize the membership functions and scaling factors of designed fuzzy controller. This control strategy can not only simplify the implementation problem of fuzzy control, but also improve control performance",

        "abstract": "The preliminary design of photovoltaic cells to be embedded in untethered aqueous microrobots, a few hundred micrometers in overall length, is briefly described. A total of 4 cells with an estimated efficiency of 12.5% should provide up to 100 microamperes of photonic current to the electronics embedded in each untethered microrobot from an incident source of green light. The need for power has been minimized through the use of magnetotactic bacteria (MTB) acting as embedded micro-actuators to propel the microrobots in an aqueous medium. Controlling the direction of propulsion with the onboard electronics would be performed by exploiting magnetotaxis inherent in MTB. Here, a small electrical current provided by the photovoltaic cells and flowing in a controlled manner in a special embedded conductor network would be sufficient to exert a torque on a chain of magnetosomes in each bacterium. Such approach allows us to independently change their direction of motion when pushing each microrobot",

The gripper is electrostatically actuated and includes an integrated force sensor measuring the gripping force. The device is monolithically fabricated using a silicon-on-insulator (SOI) fabrication process. The resolution of the force sensor is in the sub-micronewton range and, therefore, provides feedback of the forces that dominate the micromanipulation processes. A MEMS ultrasonic device is described which aligns small objects such as biological cells prior to manipulation with the gripper. The concept is demonstrated with polymer spheres, glass spheres and Hela cancer cells, thus providing a useful tool in micro-robotics and biological research",

Existing problems include radiation exposure from fluoroscopy, mental strain from reconstructing 3-dimensional images and physical fatigue from overcoming fracture deforming forces. These problems are addressed by a proposed fracture reduction robot which aids in treatment planning and reduction of the fracture. A flexible parallel robot (FleP) with an active force/position controller is designed to perform the operation. A computer-aided planning treatment tool (CAPTT) provides image analysis, path planning and simulation. An advanced human machine interface (AHMI) attempts to provide a companion feeling between robot and surgeon by using human forms of communication. The result is a reduction in radiation exposure, removal of the need to reconstruct images mentally and there is no longer any physical strain",

Unlike conventional reconfigurable robots, our design does not achieve reconfigurability by utilizing modular joints. Rather, the robot is equipped with passive joints, i.e., joints with no actuator or sensor, which permit changing the Denavit-Hartenberg parameters such as the link length and twist angle. The passive joints will become controllable when the robot forms a closed kinematic chain. Also, each passive joint is equipped with a built-in brake mechanism which is normally locked, but the lock can be released whenever the parameters are to be changed. Not only will such a manipulator have the versatility to perform different tasks but also it can be packed adequately within its designated space on the launch vehicle. Kinematics of such a robot is analyzed, and a stable control algorithm which can take the robot from one configuration to another is devised",

Using empirically-determined mapping functions, the robot's state in the emotion space is translated to a particular set of sound and movement responses.

We are interested in studying the impact of passage behaviours in casual encounters. While the system offers assistance in locating the appropriate office that a visitor wants to reach, it is expected to engage in a passing behaviour to allow free passage for other persons that it may encounter. Through use of such an approach it is possible to study the effect of social interaction in a situation that is much more natural than out-of-context user studies. The system has been tested in an early evaluation phase when it worked for almost 7 hours. A total of 64 interactions with people were registered and 13 passage behaviors were performed to conclude that this framework can be successfully used for the evaluation of passing behaviors in natural contexts of operation",

        "abstract": "A wheelchair-mounted robotic arm (WMRA) was designed and built to meet the needs of mobility-impaired persons with limitations of upper extremities, and to exceed the capabilities of current devices of this type. The mechanical design incorporates DC servo drive, with actuator hardware at each individual joint, allowing reconfigurable link lengths. It has seven degrees of freedom and uses a side mount on a power wheelchair. The control system is built and designed for user-driven or autonomous coordinated Cartesian control, and it offers expandability for future research, such as coordinated motion with the wheelchair itself. This paper discusses the current state of the art in WMRAs; describes the design goals and user requirements for this device; explains the component selection and the mechanical/electrical design; describes the controller design of the arm and optimized redundancy resolution for the Cartesian control. Further improvements are also suggested",

Although expression of robot's minds like internal states is becoming a major topic in human-robot interaction, few studies to propose a policy to design concrete expression. In this paper, we propose the design policy, called \"SE2PM: simple expression to primitive mind\", and fully implement expression of robot's minds based on the design policy, then investigate the effectiveness of them. SE2PM implies that intuitive and simple expression like a beep sound from a simple robot (e.g. a mobile robot) is more effective than complicated behaviors from a complex robot (e.g. a dog-like pet robot) in informing its primitive minds to a human. Thus, in order to investigate the validation of our SE2PM policy, we implement two robots: a mobile robot based on Mindstorms with mind expression of beep sound, and a pet robot, AIBO, with mind expression of complicated behaviors. We also conduct a psychological experiment with participants to compare the two different expression, and the results eventually support SE2PM policy",

        "abstract": "In the robot-aided ultrasound-guided microwave coagulation therapy system for liver cancer, manual manipulation of the passive robot should be as easy as possible, to improve the efficiency of therapy and popularize such a micro injury therapy technique. The robot manipulation is separated into three steps: the wrist point, the forth joint and the fifth joint are dragged or twisted to their expected position or orientation in turn. During the guide process, the expected position and orientation of robot end-effector can be decided from the focus position and body structure, but expected position or orientation for each manipulating step should be planned through particular calibration and computation. A magnetic tracker with three receivers is installed on the robot to record position and orientation of the robot, which will supply original data to planning and mapping arithmetic of the guide system. The first receiver on the robot base displays position and orientation of the robot base to the magnetic transmitter, which is imperative for the destination planning. Through simple conversion, record of the second receiver on the forearm represents the wrist position, and the third receiver on the end-effector represents real-time position and orientation of the robot tool axis. Based on such an arrangement, planning and mapping arithmetic of the guide system are provided. At last, an independent test with other error sources obviated is introduced to validate accuracy of the system. Test result shows that the error is acceptable, and then proves efficiency of the robot-aid manipulating bed and corresponding arithmetic.",

The participants were required to hold the stylus in a way similar to that of holding the stylus of a force-feedback device. A minishaker moved the stylus along its length so that the majority of vibrations were presented tangentially to the skin of the hand. The measured position thresholds decreased initially with an increasing stimulus frequency and formed a U-shaped curve in the high frequency region. The thresholds of high frequency vibrations were lower than those reported previously for vibrations that were perpendicular to the skin, but were similar to the thresholds reported earlier using vibrations that were tangential to the skin. A similar force threshold curve was obtained using a force sensor attached to one end of the stylus. Mechanical impedance of the skin derived from velocity estimates and force measurements indicated that the skin and tissues in the hand holding the stylus can be modeled with mass-, damper- and spring-like elements. A comparison of the mechanical impedance from the present study with those reported previously showed similar results for vibrations delivered in the tangential and normal directions to the skin",

One of them is the mapping of data from landmine detection sensors using a mobile demining robot in an unstructured outdoor environment. The odometry of the robot used for mapping can be improved by using an additional vision system. It is proposed in this paper to utilize natural landmarks which can be found on the ground for this purpose. New simple algorithms for detection and association of natural landmarks are developed and described. Finally, the experimental results of applying these algorithms on a set of images obtained from a camera mounted on the robot are presented.

Existing capture systems are designed for fixed experiments and are not easily scalable. In this scenario even the addition of extra data is difficult. We developed a prototype biometric tunnel for the capture of non-contact biometrics. It is self contained and autonomous. Such a configuration is ideal for building access or deployment in secure environments. The tunnel captures cropped images of the subject's face and performs a 3D reconstruction of the person's motion which is used to extract gait information. Interaction between the various parts of the system is performed via the use of an agent framework. The design of this system is a trade-off between parallel and serial processing due to various hardware bottlenecks. When tested on a small population the extracted features have been shown to be potent for recognition. We currently achieve a moderate throughput of approximate 15 subjects an hour and hope to improve this in the future as the prototype becomes more complete",

In this paper, we propose a novel wheeled type robot with variable structure functionality. It is designed with simple structure consisting of three main robot parts, the main body, the left and right wheel-arm units. The robot could achieve five locomotion modes that allows the robot to travel in various environments and climb over high obstacles. Moreover, the fast-speed advantage in flat floor condition that common wheeled robot originally hold is still remained. The confirmation of the effectiveness of the robot's maneuverability is shown by several experimental results",

Experimental results show the control scheme work properly even in the situations when faults are on and off often at different parts of the vehicle",

        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "In this paper, the authors describe the design of a bendable robotic tip for semi-autonomous colonoscopy called COLOBOT. It is a flexible robotic manipulator made of silicone rubber in view of the compact size and biocompatibility. The outer diameter of the tip is 17 mm which is lesser than the average diameter of colon (20 mm). Three servo-valves are used to control the pressure of each chamber of this tip to obtain its flexible movement. The experimental results of this new prototype show that it can bend until 120 degrees under the pressure of 2 bar. Based on the geometric deformation and a nonlinear analysis of the silicone behavior, a direct kinematic model analogous to the forward kinematics of a conventional industrial robot kinematics chain has been put forward. The proposed kinematic model of this bendable tip is an extended model of classical models found for such a mechanism. At first a polynomial approximation is used to characterize the non linear behavior of each chamber of the actuator. Next the coupling phenomena between each chamber are highlighted through experimental tests. A new correction parameter is then proposed to take into account these interactions and a non linear optimization is made to compute this coefficient. Finally, the proposed kinematic model is experimentally validated",

The thumb is designed as one part of the palm and provides the mobility of the palm. The fingertip tactile sensor, based on polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) and pressure variable resistor ink, is physically flexible enough to be deformed into any three-dimensional geometry. In order to detect incipient slip, a PVDF strip is arranged along the direction normal to the surface of the finger of the robot hand. Also, a thin flexible sensor to sense the static force as well as the contact location is fabricated into an arrayed type using pressure variable resistor ink. The driving circuits for the SKKU Hand II are embedded in the hand, and each driving circuit communicates with others using CAN protocol. In addition, a tactile sensing system is developed with miniaturized electronic hardwares such as charge amplifier, signal processing unit etc., and it is integrated into the robot hand. The SKKU Hand II is manufactured and feasibility of the hand and the fingertip tactile sensor is validated through preliminary experiments",

The mechanical configuration and the control system are described. The rhythmic movements of swimming are driven by the biological neural networks, called the central pattern generators (CPGs). The CPGs are modeled as nonlinear oscillators for joints and inter-joint coordination is achieved by altering the connection weights between joints. The CPG-based online gait generation method allows elegant and smooth transitions between swimming gaits, which result in multi-mode swimming to implement more lifelike locomotion. Several swimming modes can be obtained to mimic diverse actions of the real fish in nature, or designed according to special assignments by changing CPG parameters. The up-and-down motion can be implemented by adjusting the rotating angle of pectoral fins. The depth of the robotic fish is controlled utilizing a proportional-integral-derivative (PID) control algorithm according to the feedback of depth information measured by the sonar sensor installed at the bottom of the fish. The experimental results confirm the effectiveness of the control methods",

        "abstract": "This paper presents a wearable haptic system to interact with virtual environment. The proposed haptic system makes a user interact intuitively with virtual environment, while the user moves freely around the environment. To make wearable system, the light-weight and compactness are emphasized during the design process. MR(magneto-rheological) brakes are adopted as actuators for the device, because a brake (passive actuator) has much larger value of a relative torque/weight ratio than a motor (active actuator). As a result a new wearable haptic system, which is folded to compact size and has large workspace, is developed. To evaluate the proposed system, tangible studio is implemented to experience a virtual heritage alive",

Such robots must have no bad physical or psychical effect on humans. The psychical effect of a robot on humans has been subjectively measured using questionnaires. However, it has not been objectively measured yet. Human emotion and the consciousness direction can be measured by physiological parameters and body motion, respectively. Therefore, the bioinstrumentation system WB-1 was developed in order to objectively measure the psychical effect of a robot on a human. It can measure physiological parameters such as respiration, heart rate, perspiration and pulse wave, and arm motion. Analyzing human stress in the interaction with a robot from electrocardiogram, the robot could generate a motion for decreasing the stress",

        "abstract": "We develop a cyclogyro-based flying robot with a new variable attack angle mechanism. Cyclogyro is a flying machine which is supported in the air by power-driven rotors, which rotate about a horizontal axis, like the paddle-wheels of a steamboat. Machines of this type have been designed by some companies, but there is no record of any successful flights. The new variable attack angle mechanism proposed in this paper has an eccentric (rotational) point in addition to a rotational point connecting to a motor. The variable attack angle mechanism is a kind of double crank mechanism consisting of the two different rotational points and wings. The main feature of the mechanism with the eccentric point is to be able to change attack of angles according to the wing positions (according to the rotational angles of the cyclogyro) without actuators. The mechanism generates enough lift force to fly. We determine design parameters (wing span, the number of wings and eccentric distance) of the flying robot through experiments. Experimental results show that the developed cyclogyro-based flying robot with the new variable attack angle mechanism can hover along a vertical guide",

As computer animated agents and robots bring a social dimension to human computer interaction, interest in this research field is increasing rapidly. In this paper, we introduce an artificial facial expression mimic system which can recognize facial expressions of human and also imitate the recognized facial expressions. We propose a classifier that is based on weak classifiers obtained by using modified rectangular features to recognize human facial expression in real-time. Next, we introduce our robot that is manipulated by a distributed control algorithm and that can make artificial facial expressions. Finally, experimental results of facial expression recognition and facial expression generation are shown for the validity of our artificial facial expression imitator",

        "abstract": "This paper presents the concept of a general two degrees-of-freedom space module or TODOM. General TODOM is made up of three basic modules: one link module and two revolving modules. The reliability of the TODOM is improved by mutual backup of the control systems of the two revolving modules. Every revolving module corresponds to one degree-of-freedom (DOF). The two axes of the revolving modules can be configured to different orientations or positions by specific design of the mechanical interfaces between the three basic modules. Several such differently configured TODOMs can be assembled into some needed kinds of space manipulators that have even numbered DOF. By using integration design method, the mass and volume of the TODOM is dramatically reduced, and the system reliability of the manipulator can be improved. The rationality and feasibility of the TODOM concept is testified by the development of a 2-DOF wrist whose two joint axes are orthogonal",

        "abstract": "In order to achieve human-like quick eye movements and image processing for intelligent mobile robots, a high speed vision system is developed. The vision system is composed of a binocular camera head and high speed image sensors. The camera head is originally designed to mount neuromorphic vision chips fabricated using three-dimensional integration technology. The prototype of the neuromorphic vision chip has three layers: (1) photoreceptor layer, (2) horizontal and bipolar cell layer, and (3) ganglion cell layer. An image sensor is separately developed, which corresponds to the photoreceptor layer of the layered vision chip. The image sensors are tentatively mounted on the camera head, since the resolution of the prototype of the layered vision chip is not sufficient at this stage. The camera head has an azimuth DOF for each eye and a common elevation DOF. The weight of the camera head is strictly limited, since it is mounted on a mobile robot. In order to satisfy both demands for the quick movements and light weight, the camera head is designed based upon a simple parallel mechanism. The total performance of the vision system is examined in this work. Saccadic eye movement and frequency response are experimentally reviewed",

A micro inertial measurement unit (muIMU), based on MEMS accelerometers and gyro sensors is developed as the motion sensing part of the system. A recognition algorithm is used for real-time fall determination. With the algorithm, a microcontroller integrated with the muIMU can discriminate falling-down motion from normal human motions and trigger an airbag system when a fall occurs. Our airbag system is designed to have fast response with moderate input pressure, i.e., the experimental response time is less than 0.3 second under 0.4 MPa. In addition, we present our progress on using support vector machine (SVM) training together with the muIMU to better distinguish falling and normal motions. Experimental results show that selected eigenvector sets generated from 200 experimental data sets can be accurately separated into falling and other motions",

        "abstract": "A \"muscle suit\" that will provide muscular support for the paralyzed or those otherwise unable to move unaided is being developed as a wearable robot. Using a new link mechanism for the shoulder joint which consists of two half-circle links with four universal joints in total mounted at both ends of each link, all motion for the upper limb has been realized. Since five McKibben artificial muscles are employed for controlling the shoulder joint which has three DOF, nonlinear control method is required for posture control compensating load changes. Neural network is applied and posture control is well undertaken",

        "abstract": "In this paper the authors present the current progress of a networked robotic system intended to be deployed at disaster areas. This system is formed by three mobile robots: two twin crawlers that will have search-and-recognition tasks gathering information about their surroundings, and an outdoor-wheeled rover that will approach the area and which will also carry the two crawlers. The communication system for these robots consists of a wireless local area network that will have an operator located at a safe distance controlling them. As a final communication objective, the integration of a satellite-based IP communication, linked to the Japanese satellite ETS-VIII is scheduled. In order to be able to navigate the crawlers remotely, a wireless LAN camera and a Laser Range Finder (LRF) sensor have been mounted on both of the crawlers. These LRFs will scan the area where the crawler is at, obtaining a detailed point-based 3D image. A special focus of this paper is made on the possibility of maneuvering the crawlers based only on the remotely-acquired LRF and camera's information.",

        "abstract": "We present a new approach for reducing the computational complexity of grid-based localization methods by suggesting the development of a parametric model of the environment of a mobile robot. This model is based on the sensor perception and obtained by applying the nonparametric bootstrapping technique. Particle filter based localization methods assume that map is available but are computationally very expensive mainly due to the measurement models. This method reduces the computational complexity of these methods by extracting a parametric model from the given map to be used for measurement update. We assign multinomial probabilities to the grid cells for future inferences. Having the cell probabilities, we can update the particles obtained from action model. The likelihood calculations become straight-forward and hence complex measurement models can be simplified. Our method can exploit any feature extraction algorithm to get the multinomial approximation of the environment. The offline extraction of few vital geometrical feature is carried out at some known locations on the map. This is then followed by the statistical technique to get the model parameters and essential cell statistics. The extracted model is used for measurement updates using a simulated pioneer robot and results show a significant increase in the update rate of the particle filter",

        "abstract": "We have developed the person following robot \"ApriAttendatrade\". This robot can accompany a person using vision based target detection and avoid obstacles with ultrasonic sensors while following the person. The robot first identifies an individual with its image processing system by detecting a person's region and recognizing the registered color and texture of his/her clothes. Usually, the person following robot has to detect and recognize the specified person and calculate his/her position in a complicated real-life environment of fixed objects and moving people. Our newly developed algorithm allows the robot to extract a particular individual from a cluttered background, and to find and reconnect with the person if it loses visual contact. Tracking people with stereo vision was realized by systematizing visual and motion control with a robust algorithm that utilizes various characteristics of the image data. The developed algorithm uses several analyses to extract information on the distance to each feature point, speed of target, color and texture of clothes for a stable tracking in many situations including changes of view due to self motion, shifts in lighting and objects similar to the target. The person following robot ApriAttendatrade has been exhibited at Aichi EXPO 2005, and its robust functions and smooth person following capability were successfully demonstrated",

To efficiently utilize user's power as much as possible for long locomotion without giving much fatigue to the user while providing comfortable driving feeling to the user, the human arm characteristics were taken into consideration. Kinetostatic characteristics of human arm were experimentally investigated for its modeling.

An interesting property of IPMC is that it requires water to work, therefore it is suitable for underwater robots. In this paper, we developed an underwater robot which mimics rajiform swimming, that is the swimming form of a ray fish. Fins are designed using sixteen IPMCs. For autonomous operation, miniaturization of the electrical devices such as a micro controllers and small amplifiers are performed. A simple traveling wave control input is employed to generate moment on the fin. In the experiment, propulsion speed is measured under various control parameters. Furthermore, incremental wave of the fin is observed although the amplitude of the control input is spatially uniform. We also discuss this phenomenon from the point of view of interaction between elasticity of the actuator and fluid dynamics",

The elastic deformation of SGC enables the robot to react softly to the external forces exerted from multiple directions. Furthermore, these forces can be inferred by measuring the pressure in the SGC's hollow. The basic characteristics of the module's passive compliance and its accuracy in sensing external forces are examined through several experiments. In addition, in order to confirm the possible application of this finger to a human-care services, we executed an experiment that simulates the motion of wiping a human body, taking advantage of the system's merits",

        "abstract": "In this paper, we describe the design, modeling, simulation and implementation of an entertainment robot named \"Jumping Joe\". Jumping Joe, an artistic and agile robot, can perform several rapid movements such as fast wake up, jumping and somersault. In order to realize acrobatic movements, four different actuators which can create the high-speed movements are developed. Jumping Joe with eight DOF, which are two DOF in each hip joint and one DOF in each knee joint and each foot, can also perform the routine movements of a legged robot such as standing, walking etc. First we describe the principle of the developed actuators. Second we investigate the feasibility of the special movements performed by our artistic robot through simulations using 3D dynamical analysis software. Next we show experimentally that a prototype of our artistic robot \"Jumping Joe\" can demonstrate all the above rapid movements.",

We first bring forward the philosophy of function modularization design for control platforms. Then we actually begin to develop an embedded control platform of the CPM machine by using the method of function modularization. The core of the control platform consists of two main parts: the data acquisition function module and the motor control function module, both are based on the serial peripheral interface (SPI) network. The whole control platform is open-ended for new functions and applications. It can be easily expanded if we add new modules to the SPI network. Primary experiments have proved that the control platform works well and the design method of function modularization provides a new method for the design of control platforms",

        "abstract": "Coral reef health is an indicator of global climate change and coral reefs themselves are important for sheltering fish and other aquatic life. Monitoring reefs is a time-consuming and potentially dangerous task and as a consequence autonomous robotic mapping and surveillance is desired. This paper describes an underwater vision-based sensor to aid in this task. Underwater environments present many challenges for vision-based sensors and robotic vehicles. Lighting is highly variable, optical snow/particulate matter can confound traditional noise models, the environment lacks visual structure, and limited communication between autonomous agents including divers and surface support exacerbates the potentially dangerous environment. We describe experiments with our multi-camera stereo reconstruction algorithm geared towards coral reef monitoring. The sensor is used to estimate volumetric scene structure while simultaneously estimating sensor ego-motion. Preliminary field trials indicate the utility of the sensor for 3D reef monitoring and results of land-based evaluation of the sensor are shown to evaluate the accuracy of the system",

The system consists of a 6 DOF robot arm, a large-error tolerated gripper with two stereo cameras and onboard computer. The robot arm is composed of six identical modular joints, a big central hole in the modular joint was designed for the placement of the cables and plugs in the robot arm, which prevented them from damage of high temperature, radiation in the space environment and the motion of the robot. Joint torque sensor, joint position sensor and temperature sensors etc.., were integrated into the fully modular multi-sensory joint, which made the joint more intelligent. Also, a large-error tolerated gripper with two stereo cameras has been also designed to capture a microtarget satellite (MTS). A fault-tolerant onboard computer (OBC) with dual processing modules has been developed for the robot control. A zero gravity experimental system was developed to verify the functions of the robot arm under zero gravity environment",

It identifies the target potential escapes out of the robot view. Accordingly, the robot navigates to an appropriate observing point that is calculated and updated continuously as the target moves.

The environment exploration is done by adopting reduced generalized Voronoi graph which creates a topological map containing only GVG edges unrelated to boundary points. By setting sub-goals at meet points on the map the dead-lock problem caused by existing concave environment can be solved. The local minima problem encountered while the robot is traveling along subgoals is also solved by redefining the repulsive potential field. The system controller (look-ahead control) gives the robot a capability of controlling the distance between the reference point and the center of the robot. As a result, the potential field method performs effectively under our system and allows the mobile robot to follow a smooth trajectory in a flexible manner for attaining the desired goal autonomously whether in a static or dynamic environment",

First of all, this paper presents how this robot is developed with the goal of reaching very high speed. Indeed, it is an evolution of Delta, H4 and I4 robots architectures: it keeps their advantages while overcoming their drawbacks. Experimentations done with the prototype prove that the robot is able to reach very high accelerations (15 G) and to perform an adept cycle in 0.25 s. In order to improve its dynamic accuracy, a dynamic control could be necessary. Thus, this paper presents the dynamic modeling of the manipulator using a simplified Newton-Euler approach. The originality of this computation is to model the traveling as two separated parts and to determine the dynamic effects applied on each of them. Finally, since a dynamic control requires a good evaluation of dynamic parameters, an experimental dynamic identification is presented",

The proposed method can be used for modeling the general IPMC bending actuator in a single segment or multiple segments or patterned form. The segmented design offers more flexibility in controlling the shape of the actuator when compared with the single-segment design as it can be used to generate undulatory wave form instead of a simple oscillation form. Considering the inherent nature of large deformation in the IPMC actuator, a large deflection beam model is developed and augmented with the electrical RC model to present a state space model of the actuator system. Experimental results are compared with the computer simulated IPMC actuator model to validate the proposed model",

The designed robotic fish is composed of three parts: stiff anterior body with a pair of pectoral fins for up-and-down motion, flexible rear body, and an oscillating lunate caudal fin. We use unsteady flow theory to analyze the motion of the anterior part and the links, and adopt experimental result from oscillating foil for the caudal fin. So the dynamic equation of each part can be obtained, and by summing up these equations, the dynamic equation for total swimming robot can be derived. The desired propulsive characteristics including forward velocity, sway velocity, pitch velocity, three velocity of Eulerian angles of the stiff anterior body, motion trajectory as well as propulsive efficiency can then be obtained by solving ordinary differential equation. The circular motion, based on asymmetrical kinematics of flexible rear body, can be achieved by adding different deflections to the oscillatory links. Comparisons between simulation results and real experiments are then conducted and discussed. A good agreement on dynamic characteristics demonstrates the validity of the proposed model",

We proposed the concept of dynamic object closure for achieving object caging task that robots team is able to cage a moving object after a predefined time interval. A random caging formation testing algorithm (RCFT) is proposed for checking dynamic object closure condition. Some simulation results are presented for illustrating the validity of the proposed algorithm",

        "abstract": "We present an on-line, robust, and efficient path planner for the redundant Mitsubishi PA-10 arm with 7 degrees of freedom (DOF) in non-stationary environments. Because of the specific kinematic model of the arm, path planning can be first reduced to a redundant 6-DOF problem in a 5D configuration space, which can be further decomposed into two problems: (i) 3D position planning in Cartesian space and (ii) planning in a 3D space composed of two orientation angles and an explicit parameterization of the arms redundancy. Position and orientation planning are interweaving and performed \"on-the-fly\" without explicit global knowledge of the environment using two instances of the dynamic wave expansion neural network (DWENN), an effective method for path generation in arbitrarily changing environments. The dynamic and explorative nature of the DWENN algorithm allows to treat stationary and dynamic obstacles in a unified manner. Through a number of simulative tests, we show that the planner is capable of reaching both a satisfactory robustness level and real-time performance, as required by many practical applications",

        "abstract": "The present work deals with complex robotic structures characterized by the presence of an embedded distributed control system. More specifically, every single joint of the kinematic chain is assumed to be equipped with a simple local processing unit for properly driving its motion. As a consequence, each joint and the associated link may be considered as a defective \"1-dof only\" separately controlled atomic manipulator, which is required to act in team with all the other joints, in order to accomplish a global common task specified in the operational space. In this context the paper proposes a DP-based computationally distributed kinematic inversion technique that, based on a moderate data exchange among the processing units, allows the establishment of a global self-organizing behavior. In this way it becomes possible to execute any motion task by solely exploiting the control capabilities of each local processing unit, while not requiring any centralized knowledge about the overall structure geometry and kinematics",

        "abstract": "This paper presents a new adaptive controller for a robot manipulator to control position of projections of unknown targets using the visual feedback from an eye-in-hand camera. The controller is designed to cope with the case when the intrinsic and extrinsic parameters of the camera are not calibrated. The controller employs the depth-independent image Jacobian to map the errors on the image plane onto the joint space. By using the depth-independent image Jacobian, it is possible to linearly parameterize the unknown camera parameters and the unknown coordinates of the target points in the closed loop dynamics of the system. A new algorithm is developed to estimate unknown parameters on-line. By minimizing the errors between the real and estimated projections of the target points on the image plane, this new adaptive algorithm can guarantee the convergence of the estimated parameters to the real values. With a full consideration of dynamic responses of the root manipulator, we employed the Lyapunov method to prove asymptotic convergence of the image errors. Experiments have been conducted to demonstrate the performance of the proposed controller",

To make the robot's movements human-like, we generate approximately straight-line trajectories by using two heading direction angles of the tool-point quite analogously to how movement is represented in the primate central nervous system. Two additional angles control the tool's spatial orientation so that it follows the tool-point's collision-free path. A fifth equation governs the redundancy angle, which controls the elevation of the elbow so as to avoid obstacles and respect joint limits. These variables make it possible to generate movement while sitting in an attractor (or, in the language of the potential field approach, in a minimum). We demonstrate the approach on an assistant robot, which interacts with human users in a shared workspace",

This paper addresses this challenge associated with the computation of constrained forces at the contact points by introducing a novel approach called \"pseudo joint.\" Forward dynamical model utilizing pseudo joint has been driven for cooperating kinematically deficient manipulators. Dynamics of two-wheeled cart falls under kinematically deficient manipulator when considered from cooperating manipulator approach and it has been given as an example to demonstrate the methodology",

The characteristic parameters affecting turning performance include magnitude, position, and time of the deflections applied to the links, which are discussed with a series of simulation calculations. The experiments of circular motion with a four-link, infrared sensor-equipped robotic fish acquire a satisfactory maneuverability. Moreover, the feasibility of adding deflection angles to maneuver the robotic fish in the path planning is explored both analytically and experimentally",

        "abstract": "The use of robotics in environmental monitoring applications requires distributed sensor systems optimized for effective estimation of relevant models subject to energy and environmental constraints. The mobile robot nodes are agents facilitating the repositioning of sensors in order to estimate a field distribution. This field distribution could be, for instance, water salinity in a lake, or air pollution over an industrial area. Each mobile robot node is characterized by sensor measurement noise in addition to localization uncertainty. This paper addresses an important problem for the robotic deployment of sensor networks, namely adaptive sampling (AS) by selection and repositioning of nodes in order to optimally estimate the parameters of distributed variable field models. The AS problem is posed as a sensor fusion problem within the extended Kalman filter (EKF) framework. We present simulation and experimental results of 2D deployment scenarios using low-cost mobile sensor robots developed in our lab",

The prosthetic hand control part is based on an EMG motion pattern classifier which combines VLR (variable learning rate) based neural network with wavelet transform and sample entropy. This motion pattern classifier can successfully identify flexion and extension of the thumb, the index finger and the middle finger, by measuring the surface EMG signals through three electrodes mounted on the flexor digitorum profundus, flexor pollicis longus and extensor digitorum. Furthermore, via continuously controlling single finger's motion, the prosthetic hand can achieve more prehensile postures such as power grasp, fingertip grasp, etc. The experimental results show that the classifier has a great potential application to the control of bionic man-machine systems because of its high recognition capability",

This paper presents a calibration method for para-catadioptric-like cameras from lines without conic fitting under a single view. We establish equations on the five camera intrinsic parameters. These equations are linear for the focal lengths and skew factor once the principal point is known. The principal point can be approximated well by the center of the imaged mirror contour in practice or can be accurately estimated by quadric equations. After obtaining the principal point, we propose an algorithm to calibrate the focal lengths and skew factor. The algorithm needs neither prior structure knowledge nor conic fitting and is linear, which make it easy to implement. Other omnidirectional cameras can also use this presented work if high accuracy is not required. Experiments demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed algorithm.",

The dependence of the sustainable friction forces and moments due to the normal load applied on the contact area is studied. A model that considers the dependence of both the contact area and the coefficient of friction on the application of normal load is proposed. Specimens of simplified fingertips, made with different materials and shaped with different thickness of the covering soft layer, are tested in order to validate the proposed model via designed experiments. The results obtained have very important relevance on the design of robotic hands and fingers equipped with soft pads or skins, and can help on the choice of suitable features for the different layers of contact pads or skins",

While the user may press a button shown on the monitor under the touch screen in a conventional touch monitor configuration, in RTS, the user may press a button that is felt and shown. For visual guidance the user's hand motion is captured by an overhead camera, and is merged with the screen menu image and shown on the monitor. For tactual guidance, a tactile pattern is provided at the center of the button locations shown on the monitor. Hence the user's button pressing motion is visually as well as tactually guided in RTS configuration. To confirm the effectiveness of tactile display units in RTS, experiments were performed with and without the tactile display units",

On the one hand, at the present, mechanical characterization of biological objects in biological liquid has significant interest. On the other hand, the reduction of the surface force, and adhesion forces in a submerged medium could be a good approach to perform reliable artificial objects micromanipulations. In both cases, the micro-nano force measurement in a liquid is a great challenge. In case of a force sensor placed out of the liquid, the measurement is disturbed by the liquid surface tension. This article proposes an analysis of the disturbance of the surface tension on the force measurement. Some design rules are proposed to reduce disturbances. We shows that the major disturbances are induced by the contact angle hysteresis and a complete method is proposed to calculate these disturbances in a micromanipulation task",

This paper studies the effects of more realistic communication models on mobile sensor networks/ad hoc networks taking into consideration multi-access interference and noise and their impact on the communication range of the nodes. The study shows that the communication range changes with the characteristics of the network (network parameters and node distribution).

        "abstract": "Haptic interface devices and teleoperation masters are multiple degree of freedom devices manipulated by an operator to generate real-time motion commands to simulated environments or robot manipulators. In this work we examine the relationship between the simulated friction parameters of a particular spatial positioning master device and the completion times of planar positioning tasks by human operators. It is expected that increasing the Coulomb or viscous friction of the device would tend to increase the completion times of less difficult, quicker positioning tasks and decrease completion times for more difficult fine positioning tasks requiring higher precision from the operator. A common haptic interface device was used to perform continuous sequences of planar positioning tasks. Each trial required 10-12 minutes to complete and consisted of 15 positioning sequences which varied in the size of the target regions and the magnitude and type of simulated friction in the device. With a sample size of 10 test subjects, small effects were generally observed as expected, with the exception of the first 3 to 4 sequences of the trials which are concluded to be an adaptation or learning period for the users during each trial",

        "track": "main",
        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "Monte Carlo localization is known to be one of the most reliable methods for pose estimation of a mobile robot. Many studies have been conducted to improve performance of MCL. Although MCL is capable of estimating the robot pose when the initial pose of a robot is not given, it takes much time for convergence because a large number of random samples are required, especially for the large-scale environment. For practical implementation of MCL, therefore, it is desirable to reduce the number of samples without affecting the localization performance. This paper presents a novel approach to reduce the number of samples used in the particle filter for efficient implementation of MCL. To this end, the topological information is extracted in real time through the thinning algorithm from the range data of a laser scanner. The topological map is first created from the given grid map of the environment. The robot scans the local environment and generates a local topological map. The robot then navigates along this local topological edge, which coincides with the global topological map obtained off-line from the given global grid map. By constraining the robot's motion on this local edge, random samples are drawn only around the neighborhood of the topological edge rather than over the entire free space. Hence the sample size required for MCL can be drastically reduced, thereby reducing computational time for the MCL process. A series of experiments based on this proposed MCL/TI show that the number of samples can be reduced considerably, and thus the time required for pose estimation can be substantially decreased",

The principal difficulty comes from the fact that each can have a different resolution, but also that the resolution of some sensors varies with the location in the field of view. In this article we present a new exact approach to this issue and we explain why the problem of switching coordinate systems is an instance of the texture mapping problem in computer graphics. Therefore we introduce a calculus architecture to build occupancy grids with a graphical processor unit (GPU). Thus we present computational time results that can allow to compute occupancy grids for 50 sensors at frame rate even for a very fine grid. To validate our method, the results with GPU are compared to results obtained through the exact approach",

The annotation is an inevitable task for designers of recognition systems with supervised learning techniques. Query learning is a kind of compensation approach for this, and can also be categorized into interactive learning. Our algorithm is a natural extension of maximum margin learning; a.k.a. support vector machines. Thanks to the theoretical analysis of the optimal condition of the maximum margin learning, the algorithm runs with a single and simple criterion. To prevent poor performance of the classifier learned with very few size of labeled motion data set, the algorithm exploits cluster information of massive unlabeled motion dataset. In contrast to the previous margin-based query learning methods, the algorithm has superiority in terms of stability. The empirical evaluation using real motion and synthetic dataset shows that our algorithm can achieve both drastic reduction of annotation cost and making robust classifiers",

        "abstract": "This paper describes a real-time gait change for a walking humanoid robot. We propose a control method to change the gait motion by modifying a pre-defined zero moment point (ZMP) trajectory in real time. The stable gait change is generated by adjusting the amount of the ZMP modification according to the timing of stop command. The modified ZMP trajectory is given so that the humanoid robot can change the current motion without falling down. The modification criteria is defined from the relation between the predicted ZMP trajectory using a preview controller and the support polygon. The preview controller employs table-cart model and it derives center of mass (CoM) trajectory from ZMP reference in real-time. We make the map of relation between the ZMP modification and the timing of command for stable gate modification. The robot executes the best motion referring to the map. In this method, the humanoid robot can stop immediately within one step to avoid a collision, if humans or objects appeared unexpectedly in front of the walking humanoid robot. The stop motion is typically divided two mode; single leg stop motion and double leg stop motion. The stop mode and the next landing position are decided according to the command time of the stop signal. The validity of the proposed method is confirmed by experiment using a humanoid robot HRP-2",

Their membranes and internal regulatory networks are composed of a plethora of molecular machines, such as membrane and signalling proteins that drive a highly intelligent series of coordinated events, from metabolism to motility. Biostructures such as cells and membrane proteins serve as compelling fabrication materials for next-generation applications in medicine, energy, as well as micro/nanorobotics that can harness the intrinsic mechanisms of biology for practical applications. The interfacing of biotic with abiotic systems is expected to take advantage of the inherent evolution-perfected architectures of biology by using them to functionalize nonliving elements towards the fabrication of intelligent materials. Our work offers a strategic approach of intelligent material fabrication by interfacing the collagen Type I cellular adhesion factor with robust biomimetic copolymer membrane films that can be UV-crosslinked for enhanced durability and possess abilities to achieve high Langmuir-Blodgett deposition surface pressures for increased surface area coverage of the composite films. These films in turn serve as candidate modalities to interact directly with cell membrane-bound mechano-sensors that can use topographical or chemical cues to induce higher-order behavior within the cell such as architectural rearrangement, etc. Here, we report the use of a biocompatible ABA triblock copolymer to serve as a molecular buoy on a Langmuir film air/water interface for thin film depositions of collagen, a large structural protein amongst its many other biological functions. Immunofluorescence studies have been used to confirm collagen transfer onto solid substrates while surface pressure analysis was used to assess the dynamic nature of collagen interaction with the ABA triblock copolymer.

However, there still leaves much to be understood about how well-balanced coupling between control and mechanical systems can be achieved. Therefore, as an initial step toward this goal, this study intensively discusses the effect of the intrinsic dynamics of a robot's body on the resulting behavior, in the hope that mechanical systems appropriately designed will allow us to significantly reduce the complexity of control algorithm required. More precisely, we focus on the property of leg elasticity of a passive dynamic running biped, and investigate how this influences the stability of running. As a result, we have found that a certain type of nonlinearity in the leg elasticity plays a crucial role to enhance the stability of passive dynamic running. To the best of our knowledge, this has never been explicitly considered so far",

        "abstract": "This paper proposes an approach allowing indoor environment supervised learning to recognize relevant features for environment understanding. Stochastic preprocessing methods in combination with either of usual pattern recognition schemes are used. Preprocessing method treated is a combination of the principal components analysis and the Fisher linear discriminant analysis well adapted to the sensorial information and to the kind of environments considered. The supervised method is applied to the raw range data obtained from typical indoor environments, obtaining good recognition performances without geometrical feature extraction, allowing its real time implementation. Our work focuses on the preprocessing method, giving a geometrical interpretation of their main components, and analyzing their robustness to shape distortions and scale changes",

Advanced Mine Sweeper is developed based on sensing technologies, access-control technologies and system integration technologies for safe and effective demining procedure after the Level II survey. Advanced Mine Sweeper consists of a sensing vehicle/unit, an access vehicle, and an assist vehicle. The sensing vehicle/unit is composed of an integrated sensor and a small-reaction sensor head manipulator. The access vehicle is parked facing a mine field in order to control the sensing unit position in a global area using its boom. The assist vehicle is parked keeping some distance from a mine field. It controls the sensing vehicle/unit and access vehicle and then displays the processed sensing information for landmine detection, receiving sensing information and sensing position. By using this system, experiments in the field buried dummy landmines were carried out for the utility and performance evaluation",

The sensor head of the telerobotic system, which is being developed for D&D operation of nuclear facilities, improves the work efficiency of a human operator through visual guidance and 3D modeling of the task space. For successful and accurate task executions, three subsystems must be calibrated:1) calibration of the sensor head, 2) calibration of the homogeneous transformation matrix from the sensor head frame to the manipulator frame, and 3) calibration of the manipulator. This paper determined dominant error sources of the sensor head through the analysis of error propagation, and calibrated the sensor head by compensating the dominant error sources",

Based on characteristic matrix and multi-body kinematics, synthesis error model including static and dynamic errors are obtained. The dynamic response and vibration of the beam, which is subjected to a moving table, is chiefly analyzed. Based on Timoshenko's beam theory and Euler-Lagrange equation, the equations of motion for the beam system, which are composed of translation errors and rotation errors of the beam, are obtained. This method can offer academic reference to error synthesis model and compensation for 6-DOF simulation system",

        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "A new biped gait generation and optimization method is proposed in the frame of estimation of distribution algorithms (EDAs) with Q-learning method. By formulating the biped gait synthesis as a constrained multi-objective optimization problem, a dynamically stable and low energy cost biped gait is generated by EDAs with Q-learning (EDA_Q), which estimate probability distributions derived from the objective function to be optimized to generate searching points in the highly-coupled and high dimensional working space of biped robots. To get the preferable permutation of the interrelated parameters, Q-learning is combined to build and modify the probability models in EDA autonomously. By making use of the global optimization capability of EDA, the proposed EDA_Q can also solve the local minima problem in traditional Q-learning. On the other hand, with the learning agent, EDA_Q can evaluate the probability distribution model regularly without pre-designed structure and updating rule. The simulation results show that faster and more accurate searching can be achieved to generate preferable biped gait. The gait has been successfully used to drive a soccer-playing humanoid robot called Robo-Erectus which is one of the foremost leading soccer-playing humanoid robots in the RoboCup Humanoid League",

As the cell is very small, kept in the liquid, and observed through a microscope, the two-dimensional visual feedback makes difficult accurate manipulation in the 3-D world. To improve the manipulation work, we proposed an augmented human-machine interface. A 3-D visual information is provided to the operator through a 3-D reconstruction method using vision-based tracking deformations of the cell embryo. In order to stable injection tasks, the operator needs force feedback and haptic assistance during penetrating the cell envelop, the chorion. The proposed human-machine user's interface allows real-time realistic visual and haptic control strategies for constrained motion in image coordinates. Virtual haptic rendering allows to constrain the path of insertion and removal in the 3-D scene or to avoid cell destruction by controlling adequately position, velocity and force parameters",

In this paper, we investigate the effectiveness of the HBP mirror system for remote surveillance. We developed a real remote surveillance system that is constructed by the HBP mirror system mounted on an electric cart. Through the surveillance experiments, surveyors usually looked almost front views, and they paid attention to interesting objects only when the cart approaches them. Since the HBP mirror system has high resolution in frontal view, it seems to work well in the surveillance. We also constructed a simulational remote surveillance environment in order to quantitatively compare the HBP mirror system with a conventional omnidirectional mirror system under fair experimental conditions. As a practical task, we assumed object searching in a virtually constructed devastated area. We confirmed that objects can be detected earlier and with certainty by the HBP mirror system",

        "abstract": "This paper gives an exact and explicit expression of the structured singular value for robotic manipulators with a passivity based control in port-controlled Hamiltonian form, even though it is not possible to give the exact or explicit structured singular value for general systems. First, we focus on dynamics with endlink mass perturbation after the settling time. Second, we derive the exact and explicit structured singular value for manipulators by using structural properties of the dynamics. The derived structured singular value is nothing but the structured singular value of manipulators without control because the passivity based control preserves the Hamiltonian structure. Furthermore, based on the derived structured singular value, we quantitatively analyze the robust stability of robotic manipulators with the passivity based control",

        "abstract": "Robot imitation is a useful and promising alternative to robot programming. Robot imitation involves two crucial issues. The first is how a robot can imitate a human whose physical structure and properties differ greatly from its own. The second is how the robot can generate various motions from finite programmable patterns (generalization). This paper describes a novel approach to robot imitation based on its own physical experiences. Let us consider a target task of moving an object on a table. For imitation, we focused on an active sensing process in which the robot acquires the relation between the object's motion and its own arm motion. For generalization, we applied a recurrent neural network with parametric bias (RNNPB) model to enable recognition/generation of imitation motions. The robot associates the arm motion which reproduces the observed object's motion presented by a human operator. Experimental results demonstrated that our method enabled the robot to imitate not only motion it has experienced but also unknown motion, which proved its capability for generalization",

        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "A simple control method for redundant multi-joint arm was proposed recently by gaining a physical insight into human multi-joint reaching movements in redundancy of DOFs. Differently from the traditional approaches, the method need neither introduce any artificial performance index to resolve kinematics ill-posedness nor calculate the pseudo-inverse of the Jacobian matrix of task coordinates with respect to joint coordinates. This novel approach is based upon an idea of \"virtual spring-damper hypothesis,\" and the control signal is composed of linear superposition of three terms 1) joint-damping, and 2) virtual damper effects in parallel to 3) virtual spring effects in task space. This paper shows through experiments by using an industrial robot arm (PA-10) with redundant multi-joints that the control signal can generate smooth reaching motions without incurring any annoying self-motion even in the case of industrial robots. It is shown further that virtual damping effects in task space play an important rule in making endpoint trajectories of the robot arm quasi-straight. Consequently, the control signal can easily generate human-like multi-joint movements of robot arms without spending a huge amount of computational cost for motion plannings of not only the endpoint trajectory but also each joint trajectory",

The design method is based on the state space formulation and it allows to obtain the control gains for any teleoperation system where the master and the slave manipulators would be represented by nth-order discrete linear transfer functions. The control method allows that the slave follows the master through the state convergence between the master and the slave. The method is able also to establish the desire dynamics of this convergence and the dynamics of the slave manipulator. The advantage of this method is that it can be applied to control a teleoperation system where the master and the slave are modeled by transfer functions of different order. In order to validate the control method, simulation results are shown considering a teleoperation system where the master and the slave are modeled by discrete transfer functions of different order",

        "abstract": "This paper presents a whole body motion algorithm and shows some steps towards its feasibility in complex scenarios. We employ the framework of Liegeois, (1977) which solves the redundant inverse kinematics problem on velocity level. To make the controller suitable for a variety of different applications, task descriptors for the relative effector positions as well as a one-and two-dimensional attitude representation are proposed. The inverse kinematics are extended by allowing for \"displacement intervals\" which are formulated in task space. The proposed control scheme guarantees that the effector motion lies within the specified interval. However, the motion inside the interval is determined by optimization criteria, which can effectively be utilized to generate a more flexible and robust motion. We discuss an example and show simulation and experimental results on the humanoid robot ASIMO",

        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "This paper presents a self-organizing neural network model for visuo-motor coordination of a redundant humanoid robot arm in reaching tasks. The proposed approach is based on a biologically-inspired model which replicates some characteristics of human control: learning occurs through an action-perception cycle and does not requires explicit knowledge of the geometry of the manipulator. The transformation learned is a mapping from spatial movement direction to joint rotation. During learning, the system creates relations between the motor data associated to endogenous movements performed by the robotic arm and the sensory consequences of such motor actions, i.e. the final position and orientation of the end effector. The learnt relations are stored in the neural map structure and are then used, after learning, for generating motor commands aimed at reaching a given point in 3D space. The work is an extension of (E. Guglielmelli, et al.) including the end-effector orientation control. Experimental trials confirmed the system capability to control the end effector position and orientation and also to manage the redundancy of the robotic manipulator in reaching the 3D target point even with additional constraints, such as one or more clamped joints without additional learning phases",

The advances in field programmable gate array (FPGA) technology offer a system on programmable chip (SoPC) solution to this demand. This paper describes the technical achievement in developing FPGA-based control system which utilizes the hardware/software re-configurable feature of the advanced FPGA device to achieve the goal. We have implemented the hardware module inside the FPGA chip to generate PWM output and to count quadrate encoder pulses, which are the basic building blocks to drive DC motors. Software is developed to implement PID control algorithm using the PWM-encoder module and on-chip processor. The functional correctness of the closed-loop control system is verified by the experimental tests. The performance analysis shows that the hardware module occupies less FPGA space and the power dissipation is very much comparable to other design alternatives of similar caliber. The preliminary results demonstrate that the PWM-encoder module, in the form of user intellectual property (IP), can be duplicated and re-configured to control as many motors as needed. The success gives us a confidence boost to continue our effort to build user IP library for robotics applications which will benefit the robotics community by providing development tools and FPGA building blocks to satisfy the demand for an extremely flexible, high-performance, onboard computing unit",

We evaluated the proposed method to gait action recognition, such as walking and running, by utilizing motion capture data. In the result, the proposed method reduced parameters given by human to action recognizer and lessened human's task. In addition, the proposed method needed very small calculation cost for recognition, and can recognize robustly as much as conventional action recognition method based on support vector machine.

        "abstract": "Recently, many researchers on humanoid robotics are interested in quasi-passive-dynamic walking (quasi-PDW) which is similar to human walking. It is desirable that control parameters in quasi-PDW are automatically adjusted because robots often suffer from changes in their physical parameters and the surrounding environment. Reinforcement learning (RL) can be a key technology to this adaptability, and it has been shown that RL realizes quasi-PDW in a simulation study. To apply the existing method to controlling real robots, however, requires further improvement to accelerate its learning, otherwise the robots will break down before acquiring appropriate controls. To accelerate the learning, this study employs off-policy natural actor-critic (off-NAC), and applies it to an acquisition problem of quasi-PDW. The most important feature of the off-NAC is that it reuses the samples that has already been obtained by previous controllers. This study also shows an adaptive method of the learning rate. Simulation as well as real experiments demonstrate that fast and stable learning of quasi-PDW of an unstable biped robot can be realized by our modified off-NAC",

        "abstract": "In this paper we present an analysis of 3D line projections for central catadioptric cameras from a projective perspective. Most algorithms consider the projection of lines as general conics in the image plane with five degrees of freedom. However, in the calibrated case, only two parameters are needed to represent lines. We describe methods to obtain fast extraction and estimation algorithms. We then explain how classical edge-tracking algorithms can be adapted to these sensors. To this avail, we introduce two parametric equations for lines in central catadioptric images. We then propose a minimal representation for the euclidean transformation in the structure from motion problem and introduce possible metrics between a point and a central catadioptric line. These metrics are evaluated on simulated data. The structure from motion algorithm, from the line extraction process to the tracking and the reconstruction is tested on a real sequence",

        "abstract": "In this paper, we present a set of robust and efficient algorithms with O(N) cost for the following situations: object detection with a laser ranger; mobile robot pose estimation and a FastSLAM improved implementation. Objected detection is mainly based on a novel multiple line fitting method, related with walls at the environment. This method assumes that walls at the environment constitute a regular constrained angles. A line-based pose estimation method is also proposed, based on least-squares (LS). This method performs the matching of detected lines and estimated map lines and it can provide the global pose estimation under assumption of known data-association. FastSLAM 1.0 has been improved by considering the estimated pose with the LS-approach to re-allocate each particle of the posterior distribution. This approach has a lower computational cost than EKF approach in FastSLAM 2.0. The three algorithms have been combined in order to perform an efficient self-localization and map building process, tested for indoor environments with real data. And results show that the ideas proposed in this paper could aim in closing the loop and also to improve the overall estimation performance",

The simulations showed that adding passive toe joints allows smoother and 1.5 faster walking",

If the induced force and torque should be bigger than the static friction force and torque exerting between the carrying objects and the mobile robot, the carrying objects start to slip on it. Since this slipping motion causes increasing the acceleration of the mobile robot, then the slipping of one object leads to a dangerous collapse of all carrying objects. Furthermore it interferes with accurate traveling motions. Then we propose a fastest guidance control method with acceleration restriction of power wheeled steering (PWS) mobile robot to prevent slipping of carrying objects. The performances have been examined by simulations and experiments",

While GPS is an accurate and usually reliable aid to navigation, it can be unavailable for various reasons. The aim of this project is to develop an alternative navigation method, which can be used when GPS transmissions are not available. The method suggested here is called feature based navigation. It works by comparing the current image taken by the on-board camera with previous reference images, usually the most recent, obtained when GPS was available. The system then compares locations of similar features extracted from the images using these to determine the location of UAV. We outline the results of the method using real data taken from the data log of a UAV in flight",

        "abstract": "In robot planning problems, the complete coverage path planning refers to the problem of determining a path that a robot must take in order to pass over each point in an environment and avoid obstacles. Applications include demining, sweeping, cleaning, vacuuming, inspection robots. For this kind of problem, not only the complete coverage should be performed, but an efficient path is highly desired. Using traditional sweeping line strategy often requires several relocation moves, leading to poor efficiency. In this paper we describe a geometric algorithm for generating paths by using a modified sweeping line strategy that attempts to minimize extra relocation moves. Several examples are used in the paper to show the advantage of our algorithm over traditional approaches",

        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "There is much to gain from providing walking machines with passive dynamics, e.g. by including compliant elements in the structure. These elements can offer interesting properties such as self-stabilization, energy efficiency and simplified control. However, there is still no general design strategy for such robots and their controllers. In particular, the calibration of control parameters is often complicated because of the highly nonlinear behavior of the interactions between passive components and the environment. In this article, we propose an approach in which the calibration of a key parameter of a walking controller, namely its intrinsic frequency, is done automatically. The approach uses adaptive frequency oscillators to automatically tune the intrinsic frequency of the oscillators to the resonant frequency of a compliant quadruped robot. The tuning goes beyond simple synchronization and the learned frequency stays in the controller when the robot is put to halt. The controller is model free, robust and simple. Results are presented illustrating how the controller can robustly tune itself to the robot, as well as readapt when the mass of the robot is changed. We also provide an analysis of the convergence of the frequency adaptation for a linearized plant, and show how that analysis is useful for determining which type of sensory feedback must be used for stable convergence. This approach is expected to explain some aspects of developmental processes in biological and artificial adaptive systems that \"develop\" through the embodied system-environment interactions",

In this paper, we studied the finite motion set of parallel manipulators from a general input-affine nonlinear system viewpoint. Differential geometry tools for controllability (reachability) analysis of nonlinear system on a differential manifold are utilized together with lie group theory. Our techniques are shown to be effective by applying to a systematic type synthesis method proposed in M. Jian, et al. (2005) and W. Yuanqing, et al. (2005)",

        "track": "main",
        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "Workspace analysis and optimization are important in a manipulator design. As the complete workspace of a 6-DOF manipulator is embedded into a 6-dimensional space, it is difficult to quantify and qualify it. Most of the literatures only considered the 3-D sub workspaces of the complete 6-D workspace. In this paper, a finite-partition approach of the special Euclidean group SE(3) is proposed based on the topology properties of SE(3), which is the product of special orthogonal group SO(3) and Ropf3. It is known that the SO(3) is homeomorphic to a solid ball D3 with antipodal points identified while the geometry of Ropf3 can be regarded as a cuboid. Furthermore, the solid ball and the cuboid can be parametrically and proportionally partitioned into a number of elements. Therefore, a basis volume element of SE(3) is the product of a basis volume element of Ropf3 and a basis volume element of SO(3), which is the product of a basis volume element of D3 and its associated integration measure. By this way, the integration of the complete 6-D workspace volume become the simple summation of the basis volume elements of SE(3). Two global performance indices, i.e., workspace volume ratio (Wr) and global condition index (GCI)., are defined over the complete 6-D workspace. An optimization algorithm is developed for a 3RPlowbarPS parallel manipulator to illustrate the effectiveness of the finite-partition approach. As a result, the workspace optimization method is valid although it is computationally intensive",

        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "Almost all of conventional mobile robots for narrow spaces exploration, e.g. rescue robots, adopt crawler or wheel mechanisms. However, in narrow spaces, such robot is often stuck because the robot body is sandwiched between both sides of a terrain. Especially, with normal crawler or wheel mechanisms, it is impossible to penetrate into narrow spaces lower than the height of the robot. In addition, sealing bushes of drive shaft cause unignorable energy loss because of rotational resistances. In order to solve these problems, this study proposes an innovative flexible robot with new hydrostatic skeleton driving mechanism. The main components of the robot are a hermetically-sealed outer cover with looped structure and flexible crawlers with hydrostatic skeleton named HS crawlers. This new robot provides remarkable advantages in narrow spaces as listed below: i) The robot can change its shape adapting to terrain; ii) All ground contact areas of the robot are driven toward the same direction. Thus, the robot is able to penetrate into narrow spaces changing its shape even if the terrain is rather narrower than the size of the robot. This paper describes the mechanisms of the robot and the detail of the HS crawler. Driving force of the HS crawler is discussed with comparison of simulation and experiment. Performance of first prototype robot is verified by experiments of wireless driving and passing narrow space. The prototype robot could pass through a space of 300 mm height, whereas the ordinary height of the robot is 420 mm",

To reduce those costs, we created a flexible robot platform, consisting of FPGA joint modules that are connected by a high speed communication. To fully exploit the hardware flexibility, we introduce a flexible signal-oriented hardware abstraction that is based on a signal flow oriented middleware (SFMiddleware). SFMiddleware enables the transparent integration of changing joint hardware functionality with robot control applications. Utilizing a static system specification approach, we benefit from the abstraction of a middleware without the typical overhead of common middleware implementations. Thus, we achieve a small run-time footprint and control cycles of more than 10 kHz",

We assume that the interaction patterns are either fixed or switching based on the information topologies of the leader and member vehicles.

        "abstract": "This paper presents a flying display system using an autonomous blimp (small indoor airship) with a visual tracking system and an image projection system. The real-time visual tracking system tracks the blimp while it flies along a given spatial path to follow a wall. The image projection system projects still images or a video stream, whose rectangular shape is pre-compensated to look natural and flat using an image warping algorithm, on the surface of the blimp. The blimp is designed to have holonomic dynamics and it can maintain a stable pose and position in the presence of bounded air flow disturbances during the wall following motion. The real-time visual tracking system tracks the blimp and calculates its position in three dimensional space. Finally, we verify the capability of the autonomous blimp, the real-time visual tracking and the image projection system by experiments in the public exhibition environment. We also verify that the system is useful for transferring information and advertising in a crowded public area such as an exhibition hall or a department store",

        "abstract": "There has been an increasing interest in conducting polymers, especially polypyrrole (PPy), as potential actuators for many cutting edge applications including micromanipulation and biomedical devices. Their performance needs to be assessed in terms of force and displacement outputs before they can be employed in practical devices. As part of an ongoing project to develop a robotic gripper for micromanipulation/fabrication applications, this study focuses on (i) deriving a mathematical model to predict the force produced at the tip of a trilayer bending type PPy-based actuator under input voltages, and (ii) experimentally verifying the model. The model has been used to estimate the force produced by a robotic finger consisting of a PPy actuator and a rigid link. The results presented show a good agreement between the experimental and predicted forces for two actuators with the dimensions of (10 mm times 1 mm times 0.17 mm) and (5 mm times 1 mm times 0.17 mm) with driving voltages up to 0.8 V",

        "abstract": "This paper presents a force-based control mode for a hand exoskeleton. This device has been developed with focus on support of the rehabilitation process after hand injuries or strokes. As the device is designed for the later use on patients, which have limited hand mobility, fast undesired movements have to be averted. Safety precautions in the hardware and software design of the system must be taken to ensure this. The construction allows controlling motions of the finger joints. However, due to friction in gears and mechanical construction, it is not possible to move finger joints within the construction without help of actuators. Therefore force sensors are integrated into the construction to sense force exchanged between human and exoskeleton. These allow the human to control the movements of the hand exoskeleton, which is useful to teach new trajectories or can be used for diagnostic purposes. The force control scheme presented in this paper uses the force sensor values to generate a trajectory which is executed by a position control loop based on sliding mode control",

In particular, the principal force components corresponding to the ideal reaction force directions of the current forceps action will be amplified. The other components are displayed without amplification. As a result, only the simple but significant reaction force patterns are emphasized. Complex behavior of the reaction force, which may distract or deteriorate the intended action, is attenuated. In addition, the PI gain scheduling local force feedback controller compensates for the inertial and gravitational force of the master manipulator. Thus the true reaction force at the forceps can be felt more realistic",

In order to apply the guidance system to a fleet of underactuated surface vessels, the NSB works in combination with a low-level maneuvering control that, taking care of the dynamics of the vessels, elaborates the motion commands to generate the generalized forces at the actuators.

For applications, it is often required to find an initial shape for the specified deformed shape of the mechanism. We present here the global coordinate model (GCM) with a numerical solver that is capable of forward and inverse analysis. The model uses the arc length as the independent variable so that the shape of straight and curved links can be easily expressed. The resulting governing equations are a generalization of Timoshenko's beam theory that accounts for the effects of bending and shear deformations on large-deflected links. The effect of shear deformation on link deflection will also be investigated. Systematic procedures are developed to analyze generic compliant mechanisms. Both forward and inverse illustrations are presented. Their applications for robotic handling of bio-material are also shown. It is expected that the proposed model can give more insight on the analysis and design of compliant mechanisms",

        "abstract": "To eliminate crosstalk problem among multiple sonar sensors widely used in mobile robots, a novel frequency-hopping pseudo-random pulse width modulation (FPPWM) sequence is put forward. To ensure sharp autocorrelation characteristic, which is necessary for a sonar sensor to avoid crosstalk based on correlation technique, each FPPWM sequence is designed to include multiple variable-width and fixed-amplitude pulses, where the duration between two neighboring pulses is random and the frequency range is within bandwidth of the ultrasonic transducer. To adapt to the intrinsic physical characteristic of sonar transducers, i.e. the transmitted ultrasonic frequency can not follow that of the suddenly changed triggering sequence, the proposed sequence covers several frequency bands, which makes sure that the frequency difference between two neighbor triggering pulses is small enough for the transducer to follow. On the other hand, different combination of frequency bands has also enhanced the randomness of the proposed sequence. The FPPWM sequence is a digital signal generated by a DSP processor and no D/A converter is needed. To facilitate the correlation processing, the reconstructed echo sequence is used by compressing the real echo sequence. Real experiments using two Polaroid 600 series instrument grade electrostatic transducers validate the suitability of the FPPWM sequence",

        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "The Emschergenossenschaft based in Germany is currently planning the Emscher sewer system, arguably the largest residential water management project in Europe in years to come. In 2002, the Emschergenossenschaft engaged the Fraunhofer Institute for Factory Operation and Automation (IFF) in Magdeburg, Germany, as the general contractor to develop automatic inspection and cleaning systems to meet the requirements imposed by legal guidelines. The systems must operate continuously in a sewer line that has diameters ranging from 1400 to 2800 mm and is partially filled, 25% at minimum, all the time. To construct the Emscher sewer system, the Emschergenossenschaft favors a one-pipe line in long sections. A walk-through or inspection by personnel would be impossible in these sections. The Fraunhofer Institute IFF has developed prototypes of all systems for motion through the sewer and all sensor systems, thus achieving a new quality of inspection under these difficult conditions. This article describes significant project results and important components of inspection such as the inspection systems, pipe axis measurement, system positioning and sensor systems for damage detection. Fundamental for the development of the inspection systems are the detail of the inspection that far surpasses the video inspection common today and the capability to take comparative measurements throughout the sewer system's period of operation in order to track the development of damage",

        "track": "main",
        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "We propose a novel scheme for fusion between two types of modalities to support function-based classification. While the first modality targets functional classification from sounds registered at impact, the second one aims classification of objects in 3D images. Using audio one can answer functional questions such as what is the material the analyzed objects are built of, if the objects are full or hollow, if they are heavy, and if they are rigidly linked to their supports. Audio based signatures are used to label parts of the object under analysis. Different parts of any object can be partitioned in generic multi-level hierarchical descriptions of functional components. Functionality, in the visual modality reasoning scheme, is derived from a large set of geometric attributes and relationships between object parts. These geometric properties represent labeling signatures to the primitive and functional parts of the analyzed classes. The fusion between both of the modalities relies on a shared cooperation among audio and visual signatures of the functional and primitive parts. The scheme does not require a-priori knowledge about any class. We tested the proposed scheme on a database of about one thousand different 3D objects. The results show high accuracy in classification",

With less or no prior knowledge to robotic parameters and filtering statistics, the method employs a Kalman filter to provide an optimal estimate of the Jacobian elements and fuzzy logic controllers to adjust the Kalman noise covariance matrices Q and R adaptively. The adaptations are performed based on a matching technique of the filter residual mean value and covariance error. It greatly improves the Jacobian estimate adaptability to unknown dynamic imaging applications. A microscopic image Jacobian model has been developed for the 4 degree-of-freedom micromanipulator in our microassembly system. Its Jacobian estimate results demonstrate a good performance of the proposed method",

        "abstract": "A \"discretely actuated robotic manipulator\", or \"D-ARM\", is any member of a class of robotic manipulators powered by actuators such as solenoids that have only discrete stable positional states. One of the most significant kinematic phenomena of D-ARMs is the discreteness of both input range and end-effector frames. The main characteristics of D-ARMs are: stability at each state without the need for a feedback loop; high task repeatability; mechanism simplicity; minimal supporting devices; low cost. These are strong advantages for manufacturing automation; mobile robots; space structures; micro/nano mechanisms. The proposed design method is based on an incremental kinematic synthesis of a base-line manipulator using a numerically obtained Jacobian matrix and its generalized inverse matrix. The significance of this method is that it deals with a set of inverse kinematic problems on the special Euclidean group in three space, SE(3), instead of one on the Euclidean space, Ropf3. The conducted simulations demonstrate the feasibility of the synthesis method",

        "abstract": "We present experimental results of thrust produced by a robotic propulsor, the design of which is inspired by the ribbon fin of the South American black ghost knifefish (Apteronotus albifrons). This remarkably nimble fish moves by oscillating its ribbon fin rays out of phase and thereby passing a traveling wave along the fin's length. Combinations of thrust from the ribbon fin and body rolls produced by the two pectoral fins enable the black ghost to swim in nearly any direction without bending its body. The fish's agile locomotor system is tightly integrated with its omnidirectional, active sensing system. The robotic ribbon fin has eight individually actuated metal rays which are linked by a thin latex sheet. The experimental results demonstrate the effect of varying the propulsive wave's frequency, amplitude and length on the robotic fin's thrust production. We found that thrust production peaks at particular combinations of the three variables and that the fin could produce steady forward thrust, despite the relatively small number of rays. The robotic ribbon fin has potential application as a propulsor for future underwater vehicles, in addition to being a valuable scientific instrument in understanding the swimming mechanics of the black ghost and similar fish",

        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "This paper is concerned with a novel control method to generate any desired motion for a family of under-actuated robots such as gymnastics robots and acrobots having a single lower leg pivoted at the floor. This pivotal ankle joint can not be actuator-driven but may have only a passive viscous device such as a rotary damper. Therefore these robots are intrinsically unstable under the effect of gravity. In order to maneuver such an under-actuated robot with n joints under non-holonomic constraint without loosing stability of motion, we have proposed a zero moment manifold (ZMM) control method by introducing an (n - 1)-dimensional configuration manifold, on which a set of joint angle vectors satisfies zero of the rotational moment around the ankle joint. It could be shown theoretically that any motion starting from any initial posture on a subset of the ZMM and moving to a desired posture can be stabilized by using a coordinated control composed of gravity compensation and PD feedback. Though the theoretical proof can guarantee only stability of movements of joint angles in a narrow range, it has been observed that the robot can move in a wider range through preliminary numerical simulation results. Notwithstanding such a conservative result of theory, this paper shows that the ZMM control with constant PD gains can generate global gymnastics movements for a class of under-actuated robots by verifying through a variety of numerical simulations that most of given attractors (target postures) have corresponding large attraction regions. This is also verified experimentally by using a real gymnastics robot with four joints and a series of large movements can be produced consecutively as programmed by selecting several target postures enough separated each other and combining them",

        "abstract": "The research field on intelligent environments that consist of many distributed sensors and robots has been expanding. Intelligent environments require the functions of extracting and tracking the multiple objects seamlessly to achieve appropriate services to users under the multi-camera environments. Some tracking systems often prepare the color models of the objects in advance. It is difficult to adopt these models to the tracking of the objects that change their color appearance according to the pose. However, model based tracking is efficient for the tracking in the crowded environment. And also, the object color models have to be valid for seamless tracking in the multi-camera environments. We propose the color histogram based object model configuration. This model termed global model is efficient for object tracking and matching. The eigen space of color histograms configured from color appearance in several poses of the object is utilized for the configuration of the global model. Color histogram models needed for tracking of the object that changed their appearance can be rebuilt from the global model. As results of the first experiments, the object correspondence among the different cameras was achieved empirically, and it was described that the proposed object model is effective for the seamless tracking by the distributed cameras.",

This approach produces global exponential convergence of the constrained visual position and the contact force between the end-effector and the unknown constrain surface. This approach is based on the formulation of the visual orthogonalization principle (VOP), which, under the framework of passivity, yields a closed-loop system that fuses camera, encoder and force sensor signals. An experimental system running on Linux-RTAI OS is implemented to visually drive a constrained direct-drive robot manipulator, equipped with six axis JR3 force sensor and a FireWire CCD digital camera posed in fixed configuration. This experimental system proves the effectiveness of the proposed approach even when the robot, camera and restriction surface parameters are assumed as unknown",

After labeling to remove the noises and thinning, a genetic algorithm is applied to these preprocessing images to search the best fitting curve, which determines the barycenter position of glomerulus and set this barycenter as seed. Secondly, the image which contains complete object boundary can be obtained through watershed transform, after region growing operation, glomerulus region can be extracted.

The algorithm is based on analyzing the stability of the matching ratio of the SIFT features at different scales, and it is capable of extracting SIFT features that can be matched reliably and, at the same time, lead to accurate landmark initialization. In addition, the algorithm is an order of magnitude more efficient than the original SIFT algorithm and is therefore appropriate for the real-time nature of SLAM. As well, the algorithm can determine the quality of the visual features without any delay, and this eliminates the need for a matching or tracking procedure, as is often necessary in other feature extraction algorithms.

        "abstract": "This paper discusses the development and control of the master-slave system capable of grasping an object with unknown coefficient of static friction. Partial slip information is known to be essential for conducting stable grasping in teleoperating system. The developed partial slip sensor contains strain gages in several ridges placed on the curvature contact surface of the elastic body. By measuring strain velocity of each ridge with the strain gages, the vibration that occurs due to the partial slip can be detected. We developed the master-slave system with the slave robot uses the developed sensor to detect a partial slip and automatically controls the grasping force. When an operator intentionally decreases the grasping force applied to the master device in order to release an object, the suppressor suppresses grasping force that is automatically increased by the slave robot. Through the grasp manipulation experiment, the validity of the developed system was confirmed",

        "abstract": "In tasks of grasping and manipulation, the hand sometimes uses not only fingertips but also fingers' inner links and the palm to achieve more robust grasp. This kind of grasp is called whole hand grasp, or power grasp. One property of whole hand grasp is that the hand may not be able to generate grasping forces in any directions, so previous fingertip grasping analysis is no longer suitable for whole hand grasp. In this paper, concepts of active force and passive force are introduced. With these concepts, the contact force space is decomposed into four orthogonal subspaces. Considering the roles of both active force and passive force, a new cost index is proposed for the whole hand grasping force optimization, which is then reformulated into a convex optimization problem involving LMIs. Finally, numerical example and simulation results verify the validity and performance of our formulation of the problem with that new proposed cost index",

        "abstract": "This paper presents a novel real-time SLAM method working in an unstructured indoor environment with a single forward viewing camera. Most existing visual SLAM methods extract features from the environment, associate them in different images and produce a feature map as a result. However, our approach estimates the distances between the robot and the obstacles by applying a visual sonar technique to the image and then associates this range data through an iterative closest point (ICP) based algorithm and finally produces the grid map. Here, we reconstruct a pseudo-dense scan pattern (PDSP) which is a temporal accumulation of the visual sonar readings based on odometry readings to overcome the sparseness of the visual sonar and then apply ICP based algorithm to associate this scan pattern with the previous one. In addition, we further correct the slight trajectory error included in the PDSP reconstruction step to get a much more refined map. Experimental results show that our method can obtain a grid map using a single camera alone unlike active sensor-based SLAMs",

        "track": "main",
        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "Our long-term objective is to develop robots that engage in natural language-mediated cooperative tasks with humans. To support this goal, we are developing an amodal representation and associated processes which is called a grounded situation model (GSM). We are also developing a modular architecture in which the GSM resides in a centrally located module, around which there are language, perception, and action-related modules. The GSM acts as a sensor-updated \"structured blackboard\", that serves as a workspace with contents similar to a \"theatrical stage\" in the robot's \"mind\", which might be filled in with present, past or imagined situations. Two main desiderata drive the design of the GSM: first, \"parsing\" situations into ontological types and relations that reflect human language semantics, and second, allowing bidirectional translation between sensory-derived data/expectations and linguistic descriptions. We present an implemented system that allows of a range of conversational and assistive behavior by a manipulator robot. The robot updates beliefs (held in the GSM) about its physical environment, the human user, and itself, based on a mixture of linguistic, visual and proprioceptive evidence. It can answer basic questions about the present or past and also perform actions through verbal interaction. Most importantly, a novel contribution of our approach is the robot's ability for seamless integration of both language- and sensor-derived information about the situation: for example, the system can acquire parts of situations either by seeing them or by \"imagining\" them through descriptions given by the user: \"There is a red ball at the left\". These situations can later be used to create mental imagery and sensory expectations, thus enabling the aforementioned bidirectionality",

Later, you will see him matching his sensory expectations with existing objects, and integrating sensory-derived information about the objects with language-derived. Imagine a blue object on the left! 3) Remembering past events, resolving temporal referents, and answering questions about the past. How big was the blue object when your head started moving?

The dynamics of a symmetric, fast rotating gyro is different from that of a non-rotating solid body, e.g. in the case of small disturbances it tends to stabilize the axis. This property is used and tested in a passive dynamic walker. We investigate the stability of a knee-less walker that is stabilized by a gyro in a 3D environment, and present also simulations. As the results of this work we show that the rotor enhances the stability of the walking in the simulations. We also summarize some concepts and simulations of actuated robots with a gyro. Finally we give an overview of experiments and prototypes that are realized so far",

The ability to handle payloads moving in semi-structured ways would significantly increase the potential markets for industrial robotics. However, due to the inherent time delay between complex sensing and manipulation, the manipulation fails in some circumstances. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a generic method to model the dynamic intercept and manipulation capability of vision based industrial robot systems. In order to verify the method, we present experiments using our industrial workcell prototype to dynamically intercept and manipulate semi-randomly moving objects. We conduct experiments over 1000 runs with two different kinds of dynamic tasks, \"scoop\" and \"trap.\" The experimental results validate our theory",

We recently reported results showing that two people performing a physically shared dyadic task can outperform either person alone, even when the perception of each participant is that the other is a hindrance. Evidently a dyad quickly negotiates a more efficient motion strategy than is available to individuals. This negotiation must take place through a haptic channel of communication, and it is apparently at a level below the awareness of the participants. Here we report results on the motion strategy that emerged. By recording forces and motions we show that the dyads \"specialized\" temporally such that one member took on early parts of the motion and the other late parts. Tests in which one participant's contribution was surreptitiously replaced by a motor did not elicit a similar cooperative response from the remaining human participant, showing that the language of haptic communication between people must be rather subtle",

Recent advances in sensor technologies urge the aerial robotics community towards full autonomy. Only then, the sensors that are needed to detect obstacles will become more accurate, reliable, and smaller. The lack of flight test data in near-Earth environments poses a gap in the modeling and integration of obstacle detection sensors. To help advance the aerial robotics field we designed a hardware-in-the-loop system for near-Earth flying robots. The hardware-in-the-loop system generates the motion of the actual robotic aircraft in near-Earth environment by implementing model reference adaptive control (MRAC). The high-fidelity math model of the robotic aircraft is the reference model of the MRAC. The controller structure of the system is explained in this paper",

This paper gives the geometrical models, and particularly the forward position relationship which can be obtained in a closed form. In a third part, a detailed study of the robot singularities is made by taking into account the not-so-classic internal singularities.",

These robots are equipped with various visual sensors, such as miniature webcams, omnidirectional cameras, and PTZ cameras. As the core of this work, a formation of four-robot team is constructed to operate in a 3D space, e.g., moving on ground, climbing on walls and clinging to ceilings. The four robots could dynamically localize themselves asynchronously by employing cooperative vision techniques. Three of them on the ground mutually view each other and determine their relative poses with 6 degrees of freedom (DOFs). A wall-climbing robot, which significantly extends the work space of the robot team to 3D, is at a vantage point (e.g., on the ceiling) such that it can see all the three teammates, thus determining its own location and orientation. The four-robot formation theory and algorithms are presented, and experimental results with both simulated and real image data are provided to demonstrate the feasibility of this formation. Two 3D localization and control strategies are designed for applications such as search and rescue and surveillance in 3D urban environments where robots must be deployed in a full 3D space",

        "abstract": "This paper considers the problem of building environment models by fusing information gathered by robotic platforms with human perceptual information. Rich environment models are required in real applications for both autonomous operation of robots and to support human decision making. Hierarchical models are well suited to represent complex environments because they: offer multiple abstractions of the available information to support analysis and decision-making, and permit the incorporation of higher-level human observations. The contributions of this paper are two-fold: (1) development of a probabilistic three-level environment model for distributed information gathering, and (2) experimental demonstration of fully decentralized, cooperative human-robot information gathering using an outdoor sensor network comprised of an unmanned air vehicle, a ground vehicle, and two human operators. Several information exchange patterns are presented which qualitatively demonstrate human-robot information fusion",

        "abstract": "Motion planning for a self-reconfigurable robot involves coordinating the movement and connectivity of each of its homogeneous modules. Reconfiguration occurs when the shape of the robot changes from some initial configuration to a target configuration. Finding an optimal solution to reconfiguration problems involves searching the space of possible robot configurations. As this space grows exponentially with the number of modules, optimal planning becomes intractable. We propose a hierarchical planning approach that computes heuristic global reconfiguration strategies efficiently. Our approach consists of a base planner that computes an optimal solution for a few modules and a hierarchical planner that calls this base planner or reuses pre-computed plans at each level of the hierarchy to ultimately compute a global suboptimal solution. We present results from a prototype implementation of the method that efficiently plans for self-reconfigurable robots with several thousand modules. We also discuss tradeoffs and performance issues including scalability, heuristics and plan optimality",

This provides a simple method to control a class of under-actuated systems with three subsystems by sliding mode control. Firstly, the given system is divided into three subsystems according to its structure characteristic. Then, the 1st -level sliding mode surface is defined for every subsystem and the 2nd-level sliding mode surface is constituted by them. Based on the two levels structure, the equivalent control of each subsystem is deduced and the total control law is derived by the Lyapunov stability theorem. The asymptotical stability of the entire sliding mode surfaces is proved theoretically. Finally, simulation results show the validity of this control strategy. And the influence of the controller parameter changes for the performances is also discussed",

This paper presents both theoretical and experimental study on the control of a free-flying robot manipulator for space application. The goal of the study is to develop a new control method and hardware-in-the-loop simulation system for target capturing with vision sensor in micro-gravity space environment, considering the dynamical interaction between the space robot and its mobile satellite base.

Here, the technique is applied to the state lattice, which is used for full state space motion planning. However, the approach is applicable to many applications of heuristic search algorithms. The look-up table is demonstrated to be feasible to generate and store. A principled technique is presented for selecting which queries belong in the table.

In general, from previous sensing structures, if the stiffness of a sensor is made be higher, its sensitivity is reduced. This paper proposes a novel mechanism called strain-deformation expansion mechanism for 3-axis force sensing. By the force sensing mechanism, the small strain-deformation used for force sensing can be expanded while the sensor stiffness is not reduced but is heightened. In this paper, the force sensing principle is addressed by analyzing the deformation of the sensing mechanism and the forces acting on the sensor theoretically. Then, the sensitivity of the sensing mechanism and its expansion rate of sensitivity are defined, and a design method for realizing the sensing mechanism with high sensitivity is discussed. Lastly, some experiments are performed to show the basic characteristics and the effectiveness of the sensing mechanism",

Methods for analysis of the stability and sensitivity to disturbances are presented, and an improved version for better disturbance suppression of illumination variations and noise is developed.

The homography is parametrised by the Lie algebra of the special linear group SL(3) to ensure that only eight free parameters are estimated. With this model, we use an efficient second-order minimisation technique leading to a fast tracking algorithm with a complexity similar to a first-order approach. The developed algorithm was tested on the estimation of the displacement of a mobile robot in a real application and proved to be very precise",

This paper proposes a lexical acquisition model which makes use of curiosity to associate visual features of observed objects with the labels that are uttered by a caregiver. A robot changes its attention and learning rate based on curiosity. In the experiment with a real humanoid robot, the visual features are represented with self organizing maps which adaptively represents the shape of observed objects independent of the viewpoints.",

Unsupervised segmentation methods of many previous researches cannot always assure segmentation result that coincides with human's natural sense. While the proposed method utilizes human's teacher data of segmentation to conduct human like segmentation. We assume that latent dynamics changes at the segmentation points of action, and represent segmentation boundary by switching model of two linear dynamic systems. The problem is that human may segment actions according to wide variety of criteria depending on the attention point or other backgrounds. In this paper, those criteria are acquired by clustering segmentation boundaries extracted from teacher data made by human. Each of the cluster is characterized by body parts it pays attention to. Here, we focus on hierarchical aspect of human body that human body can be treated at various levels of abstraction (e.g. whole body, upper body, left arm), and represent it by tree structure. Experimental result shows that the proposed method can acquire human like segmentation criteria",

        "abstract": "In operation environment with communication time delay, it's difficult to compose a closed loop control structure between a master and a slave system, and some scheme to achieve the stability is thus necessary. In this paper, we discuss and evaluate our proposed human machine cooperative tele-drive system that consists of global and local path-planning, for long range traversability. The operator can command any desired path as a sequence of waypoints by using a 3D terrain model measured as DEM by the on-board sensor of a rover. The data is transmitted to the ground and evaluated to obtain a dangerousness map. To cope with an unknown obstacle, a conventional autonomous path-planning algorithm is applied between each waypoint. In addition, a rover is continuously updating its knowledge about the environment. By continuously recalculating the difference between the original terrain data used for initial path generation on the ground and the most recent data acquired by the rover, a waypoint compensation can be achieved. Therefore, we have to compensate waypoints by using the latest measurement data which can be assumed more reliable than previous data, for corresponding to the difference automatically. Here, the difference is assumed as the distortion between each data set, and compensated by using a distortion compensation matrix which is the mapping between the old and new terrain data sets. Simulation and experimental results and its evaluations by using the rover test-bed are mentioned in the paper",

Conventional 2D methods for robot navigation fail to exploit this unique ability of humanoids and thus design trajectories only by circumventing obstacles. Recently, globalized algorithms have been presented that take into account this feature of humanoids. However, due to high computational complexity, most of them are very time consuming. In this paper we present a new approach to footstep planning in obstacle cluttered environments that employs a human-like strategy to terrain traversal. Simulation results of its implementation on a model of Saika-3 humanoid robot are also presented. The algorithm, being one of reactive nature, refutes previous claims that reactive algorithms fail to find successful paths in complex obstacle cluttered environments",

This solution is a compromise between a simple bumper skin and current array-based robot skins, with better potential performances but, more costly and with usability problems.

        "abstract": "During the communication and interaction with a human using motions or gestures, a humanoid robot needs to not only look like a human but also behavior like a human to avoid confusions in the communication and interaction. Among human-like behaviors, arm motions of the humanoid robot are essential for the communication with people through motions. In this work, a mathematical representation for characterizing human arm motions is first proposed. The human arm motions are characterized by the elbow elevation angle that is determined using the position and orientation of human hands. That representation is mathematically obtained using an approximation tool, response surface method (RSM). Then, a method to generate human-like arm motions in real time using the proposed representation is presented. The proposed method was evaluated to generate human-like arm motions when the humanoid robot was asked to move its arms from a point to another point including the rotation of hand. An example motion was performed using the KIST humanoid robot, MAHRU",

        "abstract": "A humanoid robot, WABIAN-2R, capable of human-like walk with stretched knees and heel-contact and toe-off motions is proposed in this paper. WABIAN-2R has two 1-DOF passive joints in its feet to enable it to bend its toes in steady walking. Further, it has two 6-DOF legs, a 2-DOF pelvis, a 2-DOF trunk, two 7-DOF arms with 3-DOF hands, and a 3-DOF neck. In addition, a new algorithm for generating walking patterns with stretched knees and heel-contact and toe-off motions based on the ZMP criterion is described. In this pattern generation, some parameters of the foot trajectories of a biped robot are optimized by using a genetic algorithm in order to generate a continuous and smooth leg motion. Software simulations and walking experiments are conducted, and the effectiveness of the pattern generation and mechanism of WABIAN-2R, which have the ability to realize more human-like walking styles in a humanoid robot, are confirmed",

Indeed, the prototype development is based on our understanding of the humans head properties in the filed of visual and vestibular capabilities. The final prototype will have 3 DOF for each eye and 2 DOF for the neck. The developed device based as on one dof for each eye and one dof for the neck is able to show the vestibular ocular reflex (VOR) and the target tracking (TT) in real time. To carry out all these capabilities, a generic visual perception processor is developed and used. The first experiments on 3 DOF mechanism are given",

        "abstract": "This paper explores the method of designing humanoid motion considering rhythm based on human motion capture. Captured human data must be adapted for the humanoid because its kinematics and dynamics differ from those of the human actor. On the other hand, it is expected that humanoid movements are highly similar to those of the human actor. In this paper, first the motion of the human actor is segmented into primitive motions. Then, the kinematics constraints and stability adjustment method are formulated. Next, the similarity evaluation considering rhythm is discussed, and the method to derive humanoid motion with high similarity, and satisfying kinematic constraints and dynamic stability, is presented. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed method is illustrated by the experiment of Chinese Kungfu \"sword\" motion using our developed humanoid robot BHR-2 with 32 DOF",

It uses a behavior group which combines several elementary behaviors based on priority to perform simple scout tasks. And then uses one of specified FSAs designed for each more complex task respectively as the behavior group selector. The key feature is that a hybrid behavior group coordinator can be structured dynamically once the corresponding task is required to be performed. Thus, such a behavior-based robot is capable of performing a goal-oriented task by this method. The implementation of a hybrid behavior coordinator used to perform the task of moving to goal is presented in detail.

However, in addition to the usual requirements for haptic interfaces (e.g. smooth force control, back-drivability, low friction and inertia) these devices must also be MR safe and MR compatible. Previous MR-compatible actuation methods for force-feedback present drawbacks with respect to conventional haptic interfaces. Here, we present a novel MR-compatible actuator designed especially for impedance control and to meet the requirements for haptic interfaces. It consists of an ultrasonic motor controlled in speed combined with an electrorheological fluid brake which modulates the output torque over a differential gear. The entire system is integrated into a compact housing with an encoder at the output",

        "abstract": "Piezoelectric actuator attached on flexure hinge is the common structure in micro manipulation system. However, it has been the fact that hysteresis is inherent in any piezoelectric actuators, especially when using voltage steering, which in turn, can degrade the performance of the system. Therefore, it should be treated carefully. In this work, a simple Dahl model is constructed to capture the hysteresis effect together with the mechanical model. For simplicity, the nature of the micro manipulator is assumed to be modelled as lumped parameters. From open-loop experimental response, a disturbance observer is constructed based on that model for estimating the hysteresis effect. Finally, some experiments are performed. Experimental result shows that the area of the hysteresis curve could be minimized significantly. However, it is still asymmetric due to the behaviour of the flexure hinge. Therefore, an integral action is added to reduce this effect. It is seen that the hysteresis could be compensated well",

        "abstract": "This paper presents a novel algorithm, called ISOGRID (isometric grid-based algorithm), for autonomous deployment of mobile sensor networks. Upon an initial random placement of sensor nodes, the algorithm iteratively computes node movements to enhance sensing coverage and avoid obstacles while ensuring sensor connectivity. The principle is to redeploy the sensor nodes such that the communication graph approximates the layout of an isometric grid. Based on a number of simulation experiments, we have verified that the proposed algorithm always yields sensor deployments of wide coverage and desired topologies while ensuring collision-free motions of robots and promising wireless communication among sensor nodes. As the algorithm runs in a decentralized framework, it is computationally efficient and scalable. We also suggest another deployment algorithm, MEC (minimum enclosing circle-based algorithm), as an improvement to Minimax presented in (G. L. Wang, et al., March 2004) and extensively utilize it in the simulation examples to make comparison with ISOGRID",

        "abstract": "The unconventional air frames used by many small fixed-wing unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) pose difficulties in determining their dynamic models accurately. This is further complicated by the low Reynolds numbers flight regimes encountered by these aircraft. This paper studies the attitude flight dynamics identification of an unconventional model-scale UAV which has only two independently actuated elevon surfaces (no rudder or elevators). The study presents the first steps towards the development of autopilots for this kind of UAV. Utilizing the real-time flight data collected from a human-controlled test flight, the standard identification approaches were applied to obtain a MIMO linear model with given configuration deduced from a theoretical study. The simulation-based validation of a simplified model was undertaken which shows acceptable modelling accuracy. Further flight tests controlled by an autopilot tuned according to the model are currently being undertaken",

        "abstract": "The sensory ego-sphere (SES) is a short-term memory for a robot in the form of an egocentric, tessellated, spherical, sensory-motor map of the robot's locale. This paper reports on: (1) the mapping to the SES of images with much higher resolution than the SES itself, and (2) the processing of visual attention on the SES. Described is a procedure to store spatially-overlapping imagery in the SES database and to generate and update a spherical composite of its visual contents. The composite image serves both as a visual map of the locale and as a representation of the local contents of the underlying full-resolution imagery. Visual attention enables fast alignment of overlapping images without warping or position optimization, since an attentional point (AP) on the composite typically corresponds to one on each of the collocated regions in the images. Such alignment speeds analysis of the multiple images of the area. Compositing and attention were performed two ways and compared: (1) APs were computed directly on the composite and not on the full resolution images until the time of retrieval. (2) The attentional operator was applied to all incoming imagery. Then the locations and values of the APs on the composite were computed as a function of those points within the corresponding regions of the collocated images. It was found that although the second method was slower, it produced consistent and, thereby, more useful APs",

We propose a simple method to improve the remote control operability by introducing the estimated image sequence that is generated from the delayed images. The robot is equipped with an omni-directional camera to make the processing easy. The image shown to the operator is estimated from the transmitted image according to the robot's motion and the delay time. In the case of forward movement, the received image is magnified and displayed, while it is shifted in case of rotational movement of the robot. As the operator can see the estimated present image without time delay, he/she does not miss the timing of the controls. This paper describes the proposed image estimation method with some experimental results which demonstrate the validity of our method",

        "abstract": "This paper proposes an imitation learning system to generate trajectories by which a robot supports a human with close physical assistance adapting to human movements and daily life environments. The proposed system is composed of 1) division algorithms, 2) learning algorithms and 3) assistance algorithms. 1) In division algorithms, the system measures time series of human task execution data and divides them into multiple motion segments automatically. This division is based on standard deviations of motion errors between measured trajectories and an ideal trajectory where the ideal trajectory is mean of all measured human trajectories and is expected to achieve the purpose of human task successfully. Since an important motion parameter is paid attention to by the human and has small standard deviation of errors, series of measured data are divided into segment motions at the points where the importance of parameters changes suddenly. Thus this division is guaranteed to accord with human attention. 2) In learning algorithms, the system learns trajectories with dynamic neural network (DNN). Since the DNN has convergence, generated trajectories can converge to an ideal trajectory. The importance of each parameter, in other words how much attention human pays to the parameter, is evaluated as how small the standard deviation of errors is. The DNN learns trajectories reflecting the evaluated importance of parameters to accord with human feeling. 3) In assistance algorithms, the system judges when to start assistance by the assumption of multiplied errors of motion parameters by the respective importance. In assistance algorithms, the system also connects generated trajectories of motion segments smoothly. An experiment to support human drink task was performed successfully where the proposed system judged not only when to start assistance to the task but also execute assistance when a cup was about to incline too much not to spill water Show More",

Demonstration grasp trajectories are created by teleoperating a simulated robot to pick up simulated objects, modeled as combinations of up to three aligned primitives - boxes, cylinders, and spheres. When presented with a target object, the system compares it against the objects in a stored database to pick a demonstrated grasp used on a similar object. By considering the target object to be a transformed version of the demonstration object, contact points are mapped from one object to the other. The most promising grasp candidate is chosen with the aid of a grasp quality metric. To test the success of the chosen grasp, a collision-free grasp trajectory is found and an attempt is made to execute it in simulation. The implemented system successfully picks up 92 out of 100 randomly generated test objects in simulation",

During the contact between the end-effector and grasping point, there is a risk that the target and the robot can be pushed away from each other by the contact force. An impedance control of the hand with respect to the inertial coordinate is effective in keeping the contact with the target. In this paper, we propose a method for impedance control for a space manipulator. The end tip of the manipulator is controlled like a mass-damper-spring system fixed at a point in space in spite of the reactive motion of the base. In order to verify the proposed method, numerical dynamics simulations are carried out. Furthermore, an application of the proposed control to orbital service mission is discussed",

        "abstract": "This paper addresses an impedance control for a free-floating space robot in the grasping of a tumbling target with model uncertainty. Firstly, the operational space dynamics for a free-floating robot is derived with a novel, computationally efficient formulation. Then, considering the grasped target as a disturbance force on the end-effector, the proposed control method is completely independent of the target inertial parameters and the end-effector can follow a given trajectory in the presence of model uncertainty. To verify the effectiveness of the proposed method, a three-dimensional realistic numerical simulation is carried out",

Using the system an easily reconfigurable control structure was achieved, which was able to control contact forces with a sampling bandwidth of an order of magnitude higher than for conventional robot controllers",

        "abstract": "This paper describes a 1,000 Hz visual feedback using the CMOS+FPGA vision. It is required to obtain positional and angular signals around 1,000 Hz to control a mechanical system. A vision sensor must obtain visual features of a target object, synchronizing its sampling rate to the sampling rate of the control. Thus, we need 1) image capturing over 1,000 Hz with high resolution, 2) visual feature computation at the capturing rate, and 3) visual feature transmission to a control system with little delay. We propose the CMOS+FPGA vision system to realize 1,000 Hz visual feedback. This system consists of a CMOS image detector to capture images at 1,000 Hz and an FPGA to compute image features at this sampling rate. We implement two vision algorithms to track planar motion on the CMOS+FPGA vision system. First we introduce the CMOS+FPGA vision system. Second, we show the implementation of the computation of the image gravity center. Then, we show the implementation of matched filter",

In this context motion models for the intruder play an important role for planning the coordination of the robots. Often, simple Brownian motion models are used for this purpose. However, the assumed completely random change of direction in each time step is very unrealistic. We present an improved Markovian motion model that takes the intended motion direction of a person into account in order to achieve a more realistic motion prediction. This model is then used to estimate a probability distribution of an intruder's location within the environment. We develop a greedy algorithm that employs this distribution to coordinate the search of the environment by a group of robots. Finally, we compare our algorithm to two simple search methods and evaluate its behavior in simulation experiments",

Our approach uses the scale invariant feature transform (SIFT) as features and applies a rejection technique to concentrate on a reduced set of distinguishable, stable features. We track detected SIFT features over consecutive frames obtained by a stereo camera and select only those features that appear to be stable from different views. Whenever a feature is selected, we compute a representative feature given the previous observations. This approach is applied within a Rao-Blackwellized particle filter to make the data association easier and furthermore to reduce the number of landmarks that need to be maintained in the map. Our system has been implemented and tested on data gathered with a mobile robot in a typical office environment. Experiments presented in this paper demonstrate that our method improves the data association and in this way leads to more accurate maps",

We exploit the insight that the resulting travel distances are small if the bidding and winner-determination rules are designed to result in hillclimbing, namely to assign an additional target to a robot in each round of the sequential single-item auction so that the team cost increases the least. We study the impact of increasing the lookahead of hillclimbing and using roll-outs to improve the evaluation of partial target assignments. We describe the bidding and winner-determination rules of the resulting sequential single-item auctions and evaluate them experimentally, with surprising results: larger lookaheads do not improve sequential single-item auctions reliably while only a small number of roll-outs in early rounds already improve them substantially",

        "abstract": "In this paper, the independence relative map algorithm is presented. The algorithm aims to achieve the independence of relative map states. We show that using dependent relative quantities from the same observation creates a bias to the state covariance matrix, leading to an inaccurate and inconsistent relative map. Having independent map states improves the map consistency. Two case studies are presented in which we apply the proposed algorithm together with two popular relative map methods. Experimental results on simulated data show that the integrated algorithms outperform the original methods in term of map consistency and algorithm speed",

The inner core of the telescoping nanotube is actuated by applied bias voltage with a certain gap inside a vacuum chamber. From modeling analysis, the electrostatic forces are mainly driven force for actuation. At the experimental section, one end opened telescoping multi-walled carbon nanotube (MWCNT) is directly observed inside a transmission electron microscope (TEM). The telescoping MWNT is fabricated by peeling off outer layers through destructive fabrication process. Its inner core is extended and retracted with applied DC bias voltage. These processes have been done through a hybrid nanorobotic manipulation system, which are integrated nanomanipulators inside a scanning electron microscope (SEM) and a TEM. From experimental and analytical results, the possibility of nano-scale actuator applications using telescoping MWCNT with precision has been presented",

        "abstract": "This paper describes a motion controller which issues incremental velocity commands to a nonholonomic mobile robot guided by a holonomic path planner. The controller finds the best pair of rotational and translational velocities through discrete optimization of a multi-criteria objective function. Valid velocity choices are restricted within the dynamic velocity window as determined by the current velocities and the maximum acceleration and deceleration ability of the robot (smoothness criterion). In addition, for each choice the objective function examines the proximity of the resulting stopping configuration to the current goal set by the planner (accuracy criterion). Finally, it takes into account the potential of unforeseen, perhaps unavoidable, collisions due to dynamic obstacles or due to the holonomic nature of the path planner (safety criterion). The controller issues commands which balance these criteria as determined by the user. The proposed controller has been implemented and tested on a Nomad 200 mobile robot achieving smooth, accurate, and safe motion control both in simulated and in real environments",

Local features are extracted from images obtained in sequence, and are used both to cluster the images into nodes and to detect links between the nodes. The algorithm is incremental, reducing the computational requirements of the corresponding batch algorithm. Experimental results in a complex, indoor environment show that the algorithm produces topologically correct maps, closing loops without suffering from perceptual aliasing or false links. Robustness to lighting variations was further demonstrated by building correct maps from combined multiple datasets collected over a period of 2 months",

Measurements of the gravitational and geomagnetic fields are used to estimate orientation errors. A coordinate-free control law is defined on the Lie algebra and fed back in terms of angular velocity that steers the observer towards the correct attitude. A proof of stability for the proposed estimator is provided which relies on the natural (bi-invariant) metric of SO(3). The observer results stable for almost the whole configuration space. Presence of unstable equilibria as a limitation for global stability is also discussed. Based on the proposed intrinsic control law, a filter is designed which implements the observer. Simulations are presented that test the numerical implementation of the proposed observer",

A method for discriminating a property of an object with the use of generated sound when striking it with a hammer is called a hammering test. This method can investigate non-visual features of objects such as inner structure of objects, e.g., the existence of defects and cracks inside objects. However, this method depends on human experience and skills. In addition, if we perform this test over a wide area of objects, it is required to manually record hammering positions one by one. To solve these problems, this paper proposes a hammering test system consisting of two video cameras that can acquire image and sound signals of a hammering scene. The shape of the object (visual feature) is measured by the image signal processing from the result of 3-D measurement of each hammering position, and the thickness or material (non-visual feature) is estimated by the sound signal processing in time and frequency domains. The validity of proposed method is shown through experiments",

        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "Humanoid robots are inherently unstable because their center of mass is high, compared to the support polygon's size. Bipedal walking currently works well only under controlled conditions with limited external disturbances. In less controlled dynamic environments, such as RoboCup soccer fields, external disturbances might be large. While some disturbances might be too large to prevent a fall, some disturbances can be dealt with by specific rescue behaviors. This paper proposes a method to detect instabilities that occur during omnidirectional walking. We model the readings of attitude sensors using sinusoids. The model takes the gait target vector into account. We estimate model parameters from a gait test sequence and detect deviations of the actual sensor readings from the model later on. These deviations are aggregated to an instability indicator that triggers one of two reflexes, based on indicator strength. For small instabilities the robot is slowing down, but continues walking. For stronger instabilities the robot stops and is brought into a stable posture with a low center of mass. Walking continues as soon as the instability disappears. We extensively evaluated our approach in simulation by disturbing the robot with a variety of impulses. The results indicate that our method is very effective. For smaller disturbances, the probability of a fall could be reduced to zero. Most of the medium-sized disturbances could also be rejected. For the evaluation with the real robot, we used a walking against a wall with different speeds and at various angles. Here the results show a similar outcome to the ones in the simulations",

        "abstract": "This paper describes an autonomous platform for exploration and navigation within networks of tunnels, as those typically found in underground mines and caves. In this context, we propose a system allowing two modes of operation: exploration/surveying mode and autonomous navigation mode. In the exploration mode, a remotely located supervisor instructs the platform to move through successive sections of the network, gathering range data that is then concatenated into 2D/3D survey maps of the environment. In the navigation mode, the supervisor specifies high-level missions on the previously acquired survey maps. A motion planner then translates each mission into a set of consecutive navigation actions, separated by natural landmarks. Mission execution consists of autonomously detecting landmarks, self-localizing and performing the planned navigation actions. Advanced and innovative features, mostly related to exploration capabilities, navigation mode switcher, and the integrated aspect of our system distinguish it from the systems described in the literature",

        "abstract": "In this paper we present a framework for grasp planning with a humanoid robot arm and a five-fingered hand. The aim is to provide the humanoid robot with the ability of grasping objects that appear in a kitchen environment. Our approach is based on the use of an object model database that contains the description of all the objects that can appear in the robot workspace. This database is completed with two modules that make use of this object representation: an exhaustive offline grasp analysis system and a real-time stereo vision system. The offline grasp analysis system determines the best grasp for the objects by employing a simulation system, together with CAD models of the objects and the five-fingered hand. The results of this analysis are added to the object database using a description suited to the requirements of the grasp execution modules. A stereo camera system is used for a real-time object localization using a combination of appearance-based and model-based methods. The different components are integrated in a controller architecture to achieve manipulation task goals for the humanoid robot",

Regardless of the architectural approach, such systems may grow in size and complexity to levels where the capacities of people are strongly challenged. Such systems are commonly researched, designed and developed following several methods and with the help of a variety of software tools. In this paper we want to describe our research and development environment. It is composed of a set of tools that support our research and enable us to develop large scale intelligent systems used in our robots and in our test platforms. The main parts of our research and development environment are: the component models BBCM (brain bytes component model) and BBDM (brain bytes data model), the middleware RTBOS (real-time brain operating system), the monitoring system CMBOS (control-monitor brain operating system) and the design environment DTBOS (design tool for brain operating system).

We first describe a 3D data acquisition architecture based on a standard 2D laser. Techniques for registering scans using a scan matching procedure and for estimating the errors are then introduced. We finally present results showing the performance of the proposed architecture in real outdoor environments by means of the integration of the 3D scans with dead reckoning and inertial measurement unit (IMU) information",

The experimental evaluation is performed in a realistic setting where the main concentration is put on the synergy of object recognition and simultaneous localization and mapping systems",

        "abstract": "This papers deals with the problem of tracking a piecewise-planar scene in a video sequence and, at the same time, with the problem of estimating accurately the 3D displacement of the camera for robotic applications. A new approach to the problem is proposed and two noticeable contributions are given. Firstly, the explicit dependency between the 2D image transformation parameters (a homography for each plane) and the 3D camera displacement parameters is computed. Secondly, a second-order optimization algorithm is proposed. The second-order optimization considerably increases the convergence domain and the convergence rate of standard first-order optimization algorithms while having an almost equivalent computational complexity",

        "abstract": "The intelligent home service robotic system has been developed in order to assist the aged or the disabled people in the population-aging society. The developed robotic system was demonstrated from June 9 to June 19 at the 2005 World Exposition, Aichi, Japan. The purpose of our research is developing robotic system to provide daily services such as bringing some objects to the elderly or disabled wheelchair users. Network distributed monitoring system was also developed in order to monitor the state of robotic system working and the state of the aged or disabled. The developed system uses robot technology middleware (RTM), which was developed by AIST (Agency of Industrial Science and Technology, Japan) to promote application of robot technology (RT) in various fields. RTM is based on CORBA, so has high scaling and inter-operating ability and facilitates network distributed software and sharing. Using RT middleware, we can develop robotic functional elements as \"RT software component\", which makes application and system integration easier. This paper introduces the architecture of the developed demonstration robotic system and the results of a demonstration conducted at the exhibition",

In order to simplify identification and control, it is desirable for mini autonomous helicopter to hold rotor speed constant, since varying rotor speed causes varying aerodynamics. An intelligent rotor speed controller has been developed, which adopts the control algorithms of feed forward and fuzzy tuned PI. The hardware design especially the tachometer design is described in this paper. To improve the performance of PI controller, a fuzzy logic supervisor has been proposed for tuning the gain parameters of PI controller online. The controller is then applied in a mini autonomous helicopter to verify its performance. The experimental results of real flights have shown that the intelligent rotor speed controller is superior in dynamic and steady state performance for its advantages of quick response and good robustness. Numerous flights have also proven its reliability",

Behaviors of these humanoids and their surrounding network environment can be created, added and removed dynamically via a simple scripting method. Some experiments on our network-based humanoid are presented in this paper. Experimental results show that the multi-agent architecture is a good selection for developing this system. It provides an extendable behavior control method in the network environment and it decreases the development time for adding new services. Using this distributed multi-agent architecture, roles of a humanoid, method for coordination and performing scenario can be changed easily",

We address here the principle of ideomotor compatibility by which observing the movements of others influences the quality of one's own performance. A neural model capable of replicating a stimulus-response compatibility task, originally designed to measure the effect of ideomotor compatibility on human behavior, was implemented on a humanoid robot. The video illustrates that this capacity may provide a robot with human-like behavior, but at the expense of disadvantages, such as hesitation and mistakes. First a demonstration of the stimulus-response task involving human experimenter and subject is shown. It is then followed by the replication of the experiment with the robot.",

        "abstract": "More and more wireless mobile sensor networks are employed by robotics to perform harsh tasks such as disaster rescue, emission sources localization or hazardous contaminants localization. There are a lot of network optimization problems to be solved in the protocol design of wireless mobile sensor networks (WMSN), such as rate control, flow control, congestion control, medium access control, queue management, power control and topology control etc. These issues involve several layers of the network protocol stack so that it's quite difficult to consider every single optimization problem of them in a holistic view. The majority of contemporary research works mainly deal with one or some of them in terms of certain applications or objectives. However, most of the proposed protocols are based on simulations or experiments which lack of sufficient mathematical or theoretical analysis to fully understand the convergence or stability. In order to study the theoretical basis of network algorithms, this paper briefly outlines the current methodologies exploited to design and optimize the performance of sensor networks. In addition, the paper investigates the theoretical aspects to make sense of the network optimization algorithms and give a survey mainly in terms of convex optimization, game theory and artificial intelligence",

This paper presents a study of spatial distances and orientation of a robot with respect to a human user in an experimental setting. Relevant concepts of spatiality from social interaction studies are introduced and related to human-robot interaction (HRI). A Wizard-of-Oz study quantifies the observed spatial distances and spatial formations encountered. However, it is claimed that a simplistic parameterization and measurement of spatial interaction misses the dynamic character and might be counter-productive in the design of socially appropriate robots",

        "abstract": "In this paper, the coupling between Jacobian learning and task sequencing through the redundancy approach is studied. It is well known that visual servoing is robust to modeling errors in the Jacobian matrices. This justifies why Jacobian estimation does not usually degrade the system convergence. However, we show that this is not true any more when the redundancy formalism is used. In this case the Jacobian matrix is also necessary to compute projection operators for task decomposition, which is quite sensitive to errors. We show that learning improves the servoing performance, when task sequencing is used. Conversely, sequencing improves the convergence of learning, especially for tasks involving several degrees of freedom. Eye-in-hand and eye-to-hand experiments have been performed on two robots with six degrees of freedom",

Indeed, a method is proposed to estimate the reduced set of kinematic parameters appearing in such a control. To do so, it extends a linear method, obtained for a perspective camera, to the case of an omnidirectional camera, using an existing unifying projection model. The proposed method remains linear, once adequate information is extracted from the omnidirectional images, and does not require any calibration pattern. It works both with perspective and omnidirectional cameras, which is underlined by the reported experiments",

Different kinematics equations are derived based on its multi-locomotion modes respectively, and their features of kinematics in different modes are revealed. Particularly, the kinematic description of differential driven in wheeled mode, characteristics of slippage in tracked mode and posture definition in legged mode are presented mathematically. Unlike other robot operating on a flat surface, the proposed equations are solved to obtain the robot position and posture which can be used for autonomous motion control of robot operating in rough terrains",

        "abstract": "Based on the current research results of anthropomorphic-arm bionics and parallel manipulators, a motion control approach for a 7-DOF cable-driven manipulator is proposed. This paper introduces mechanical structure design of this anthropomorphic-arm first. For the inverse kinematics of the 7-DOF manipulator, a hybrid algorithm, based on gradient projection method and Paden-Kahan sub problems, is proposed to make the trajectory tracing of the manipulator in task space with high accuracy; a joint rate redistribution approach is also employed to optimize kinematic performance criterion and improve the fault-tolerance of the manipulator. The coupling cable lengths among the different joint modules, i.e., shoulder, elbow, and wrist joints, are analyzed in detail. Finally, to demonstrate the proposed algorithm, by utilizing ADAMS software, a straight-line trajectory motion simulation for the 7-DOF cable-driven manipulator is realized",

The suggested approach converts the gradient guidance field from a harmonic potential to a control signal by augmenting it with a novel type of dampening forces suggested in this paper called: nonlinear, anisotropic, dampening forces (NADFs). The combination of the two provides a signal that can both guide a robot and effectively manage its dynamics. The kinodynamic planning signal inherits, fully, the guidance capabilities of the harmonic gradient field. It can also be easily configured to efficiently suppress the inertia-induced transients in the robot's trajectory without compromising the speed of operation.

        "abstract": "Using each other's knowledge and expertise in learning - what we call cooperation in learning- is one of the major existing methods to reduce the number of learning trials, which is quite crucial for real world applications. In situated systems, robots become expert in different areas due to being exposed to different situations and tasks. As a consequence, areas of expertise (AOE) of the other agents must be detected before using their knowledge, especially when the exchanged knowledge is not abstract, and simple information exchange might result in incorrect knowledge, which is the case for Q-learning agents. In this paper we introduce an approach for extraction of AOE of agents for cooperation in learning using their Q-tables. The evaluating robot uses a behavioral measure to evaluate itself, in order to find a set of states it is expert in. That set is used, then, along with a Q-table-based feature for extraction of areas of expertise of other robots by means of a classifier. Extracted areas are merged in the last stage. The proposed method is tested both in extensive simulations and in real world experiments using mobile robots. The results show effectiveness of the introduced approach, both in accurate extraction of areas of expertise and increasing the quality of the combined knowledge, even when, there are uncertainty and perceptual aliasing in the application and the robot",

In this paper, a landing pattern modification method adaptable to uneven terrain in a real environment is proposed which is based on a predictive attitude compensation control and a nonlinear compliance control. This method does not require any other sensors except force sensors. Also, a new biped foot system is described which can form larger support polygons on uneven terrain than conventional biped foot systems. Using the modification method and the foot system, WL-16RII (Waseda Leg-No.16 Refined II) achieved a stable walk on bumpy terrain with 20 mm height and 10 degrees inclination. Furthermore, a stable dynamic walk was realized on a paved road, when a human rode it. Through various walking experiments, the effectiveness of the method was confirmed",

        "abstract": "Many vision-based navigation systems are restricted to use only a limited number of landmarks when computing the camera pose. This limitation is due to the overhead of detecting and tracking these landmarks along the image sequence. A new algorithm is proposed for subset selection from the available landmarks. This algorithm searches for the subset that yields minimal uncertainty for the obtained pose parameters. Navigation tasks have different types of goals: moving along a path, photographing an object for a long period of time etc. The significance of the various pose parameters differs for different navigation tasks. Therefore, a requirements matrix is constructed from a supplied severity function, which defines the relative importance of each parameter. This knowledge can then be used to search for the subset that minimizes the uncertainty of the important parameters, possibly at the cost of greater uncertainty in others. It is shown that the task-oriented landmark selection problem can be defined as an integer-programming problem for which a very good approximation can be obtained. The problem is then translated into a semi-definite programming representation which can be rapidly solved. The feasibility and performance of the proposed algorithm is studied through simulations and lab experimentation",

        "abstract": "Vision being the most important human sensor and feedback system is considered to play a prominent role in the future of robotics. Robust techniques for visual robot navigation are essential in service robotics tasks. This contribution presents a novel approach to large view visual servoing of a mobile robot with a pan-tilt camera. A predictive camera control scheme guarantees that the image features remain in the cameras field of view. In a demonstration the robot is manually guided through the environment and reference images of landmarks are taken at distinct waypoints. During autonomous navigation the robot later follows the demonstrated path solely based on the visual feedback provided by the landmarks. The camera gaze is controlled independent of the robots egomotion which enables the robot to track landmark features across larger distances and orientations. Therefore, fewer visual landmarks are required to describe a smooth path through the environment. In order to control the robot motion independent of the gaze the observed features are transformed from the image plane into a virtual camera plane. The rotational, lateral and longitudinal motion are controlled separately by selecting appropriate image features that decouple the rotational and translational velocity component. This property is particular useful for traversing confined indoor spaces such as corridors, in which landmarks are located lateral to the direction of robot motion",

Existing systems rely on simple laser point clustering methods to extract object locations. However, when dealing with multiple interacting people, laser points of different persons are often interlaced and undistinguishable due to measurement noise and they can not provide reliable features. It causes current systems quite fragile and unreliable. In this paper, we try to explore potentials from multi-level observations including weakly detected features, stably extracted features and foreground points. For inference, detection incorporated joint particle filter is used. And stably extracted features are utilized to properly estimate parameters of dynamic model for each target. In real experiments, we obtain raw data from multiple registered laser scanners, which measure two legs for each people. Evaluations with real data show that the proposed method is more robust and effective than existing approaches",

        "abstract": "Acquiring, representing and modeling human skills is one of the key research areas in teleoperation, programming-by-demonstration and human-machine collaborative settings. One of the common approaches is to divide the task that the operator is executing into several subtask in order to provide manageable modeling. In this paper we consider the use of a layered hidden Markov model (LHMM) to model human skills. We evaluate a gestem classifier that classifies motions into basic action-primitives, or gestems. The gestem classifiers are then used in a LHMM to model a simulated teleoperated task. We investigate the online and offline classification performance with respect to noise, number of gestems, type of HMM and the available number of training sequences. We also apply the LHMM to data recorded during the execution of a trajectory-tracking task in 2D and 3D with a robotic manipulator in order to give qualitative as well as quantitative results for the proposed approach. The results indicate that the LHMM is suitable for modeling teleoperative trajectory-tracking tasks and that the difference in classification performance between one and multi-dimensional HMMs for gestem classification are small. It can also be seen that the LHMM is robust w.r.t misclassifications in the underlying gestem classifiers",

        "abstract": "In this paper we study learning in cooperative object pushing systems. The proposed approach is based on the idea of learning individual skills and then mapping the required cooperative behaviors on the learned skills. The control point for each individual robot is chosen so as to simplify the design of the reinforcement signal and reduce the role of delayed reward on individual learning in addition to make cooperative protocol simpler. A fuzzy Q-learning system for learning individual object pushing is proposed, together with a method for coordination among the robots to push the object cooperatively. The coordination method takes into account the dynamics of the object and the learned individual skills. The idea of the coordination protocol is based on the notion of ability and active regions defined in this paper. In effect, the cooperation protocol is mapped to a Q-value based policy. Simulation results supportively show that the robots learn individual and cooperative object pushing efficiently",

        "abstract": "This work is about the relevance of Gibson's concept of affordances for visual perception in interactive and autonomous robotic systems. In extension to existing functional views on visual feature representations, we identify the importance of learning in perceptual cueing for the anticipation of opportunities for interaction of robotic agents. We investigate how the originally defined representational concept for the perception of affordances - in terms of using either optical flow or heuristically determined 3D features of perceptual entities should be generalized to using arbitrary visual feature representations. In this context we demonstrate the learning of causal relationships between visual cues and predictable interactions, and emphasize on a novel framework for cueing and hypothesis verification of affordances that could play an important role in future robot control architectures. We argue that affordance based perception should enable systems to react to environment stimuli both more efficient and autonomous, and provide a potential to plan on the basis of responses to more complex perceptual configurations. We verify the concept with a concrete implementation applying state-of-the-art visual descriptors and regions of interest within a simulated robot scenario and prove that these features were successfully selected for predicting opportunities of robot interaction",

The majority of path planning approaches has been designed to entirely solve the given problem from scratch given the current and goal configurations of the robot. Although these approaches yield highly efficient plans, the computed policies typically do not transfer to other, similar tasks. We propose to learn relational decision trees as abstract navigation strategies from example paths. Relational abstraction has several interesting and important properties. First, it allows a mobile robot to generalize navigation plans from specific examples provided by users or exploration. Second, the navigation policy learned in one environment can be transferred to unknown environments. In several experiments with real robots in a real environment and in simulated runs, we demonstrate the usefulness of our approach",

        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "Humanoid robots are routinely engaged in tasks requiring the coordination between multiple degrees of freedom and sensory inputs, often achieved through the use of sensorymotor maps (SMMs). Most of the times, humanoid robots have more degrees of freedom (DOFs) available than those necessary to solve specific tasks. Notwithstanding, the majority of approaches for learning these SMMs do not take that into account. At most, the redundant degrees of freedom (degrees of redundancy, DOR) are \"frozen\" with some auxiliary criteria or heuristic rule. We present a solution to the problem of learning the forward/backward model, when the map is not injective, as in redundant robots. We propose the use of a \"Minimum order SMM\" that takes the desired image configuration and the DORs as input variables, while the non-redundant DOFs are viewed as outputs. Since the DORs are not frozen in this process, they can be used to solve additional tasks or criteria. This method provides a global solution for positioning a robot in the workspace, without the need to move in an incremental way. We provide examples where these tasks correspond to optimization criteria that can be solved online. We show how to learn the \"Minimum Order SMM\" using a local statistical learning method. Extensive experimental results with a humanoid robot are discussed to validate the approach, showing how to learn the Minimum Order SMM of a redundant system and using the redundancy to accomplish auxiliary tasks.",

We propose a hybrid system method for localization consisted of on-line and off-line subsystems inspired by human cognition. For the on-line subsystem, we use the landmark based Markov localization method to estimate the position. When the robot does not update the probability of current position through landmarks for a certain period, we use the off-line experience subsystem to help. In addition to the hybrid system for individual localization, we propose a method of dynamic reference object for collaborative localization. By using this method, an autonomous robot can estimate and correct its position perception more accurately and effectively, taking the odometry error and other negative influence into consideration. Satisfactory experimental results are obtained in the RoboCup Four-Legged League environment",

In contrast to traditional approaches that make intensive use of accurate measurements, numerical models and control theory, the proposed biomimetic approach favors the concepts of perception, situation, skill and behavior - concepts that are used to describe human and animal behavior as well. Sensing should primarily be based on those senses that have proved their effectiveness in nature, such as vision, tactile sensing and hearing. Furthermore, human-robot communication should mimic dialogues between humans. It should be situation-dependent, multimodal and primarily based on spoken natural language and gestures. Applying these biomimetic concepts to the design of our robots led to adaptable, dependable and human-friendly behavior, which was proved in several short- and long-term experiments",

        "abstract": "This paper presents the cognitive architecture Con-SCIS (conceptual space based cognitive imitation system), which tightly links low-level data processing with knowledge representation in the context of imitation learning. We use the word imitate to refer to the paradigm of program-level imitation: we are interested in the final effects of actions on objects, and not on the particular kinematic or dynamic properties of the motion. The same architecture is used both to analyze and represent the task to be imitated, and to perform the imitation by generalizing in novel and different circumstances. The implemented experimental scenario is a simplified two-dimensional world populated with various objects in which observation/imitation takes place. During the observation phase, the user shows her/his hand while performing arbitrary tasks of manipulating objects in front of a single calibrated camera. The task is then segmented into meaningful units and its properties (objects' color and shape, their absolute position and orientation, relations between objects) are represented into high-level symbolic terms. In the imitation phase, the symbolic information is employed to drive the robot's actions. To validate our approach, we report some results concerned with the problem of teaching a humanoid hand/arm robotic system tasks of assembling different workspace objects",

We have implemented steering control that models human behavior in trying to avoid obstacles while trying to follow a desired path. Here we present the formulation for this control system and its independent parameters, and then show how these parameters can be automatically estimated by observation of a human driver. We present results from experiments with a vehicle (both real and simulated) that avoids obstacles while following a prescribed path at speeds up to 4 m/sec. We compare the proposed method with another method based on principal component analysis, a commonly used learning technique. We find that the proposed method generalizes well and is capable of learning from a small number of examples",

The proposed algorithm is based on two successive least-squares estimations based on the continuous-time kinematic equations of motion; the time-discretization error, thus, is avoided. The use of the least-squares technique is made possible by observing a linear mapping between the unknowns and the measurements and it is not the results of a linearization. Another advantage of the proposed technique is that no predefined path is required, i.e., the robot can move under a preferred navigation algorithm. The basic technique makes use of video-camera measurements and absolute position readings of the wheels' encoders, the use of different sensors and measurements of the wheels velocities is also discussed. Experimental results with the mobile robot Khepera II confirm the effectiveness of the proposed technique",

Metric interactions are learned in a dynamic Bayesian network and placed in a probabilistic systems model called a system map, which is used to understand how the metrics relate both to each other and to a partially known environment. Initial results presented here demonstrate how this model identifies environmental dependencies and how performance can be predicted even in an uncertain environment",

The novelty of the overall system is its applicability to cases that do not allow for the direct proximity measurement of the vehicle's pose (position and orientation). Herein, the proposed neural-network (NN) based guidance methodology is implemented on-line during the final stage of the vehicle's motion (i.e., docking). The systematic motion errors of the vehicle are reduced iteratively by executing the corrective motion commands, generated by the NN, until the vehicle achieves its desired pose within random noise limits. The guidance methodology developed was successfully tested via simulations for a 6-dof (degree-of-freedom) vehicle and via experiments for a 3-dof high-precision planar platform",

Each vehicle can be equipped with proprioceptive and exteroceptive sensors enabling it to localize itself in its environment and also to localize (but not to identify) the other members of the group. Localization information can be exchanged between the vehicles through a wireless communication device. Every member of the group maintains (if possible) an estimation of the state of its environment and transmits it (if possible) to its neighbors. The global state of the environment is obtained by fusing the environment states of the vehicles. This fusion is based on extended Kalman filter where the poses of the detected vehicles are represented by a single system. The proposed approach takes into account the sensor constraints such as data unavailability and delays",

        "abstract": "A person buried by a snow avalanche can be found by measuring the magnetic field generated by an avalanche beacon or ARVA carried by the victim. However, the signals received are difficult to interpret and require people with good training on the actual searching techniques. In this paper we show that the search can be automated using SLAM techniques. The rescuer is equipped with an inertial sensor to estimate its own motion and a triple antenna to obtain 3D measurements of the magnetic field generated by the victim's ARVA. Both measurements are used to build a \"robocentric\" map that contains the location of the victim relative to the rescuer. To solve this highly non-linear SLAM problem we propose and compare two alternative solutions based on a sum of Gaussians (SOGs) filter and a particle filter. We present simulation results showing that, for comparable computing times, the SOGs solution gives more accurate results",

        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "In this paper, the feasibility of utilizing sound for robot's pose detection is investigated, and a novel and robust robot location and orientation detection method based on sound field features for noisy environment is proposed. Unlike traditional methods, the proposed method does not explicitly consider the characteristic of direct path from sound source to microphones, nor attempt to suppress the effect of reverberations and noise signals. Instead, it utilizes the sound field features of a robot at different location and orientation in a normal environment. The sound field feature is captured by using a probability distribution estimation method called Gaussian mixture model (GMM). The experimental results show that this method can detect robot's location and orientation under both line-of-sight and non-line-of-sight conditions using only two microphones and is robust to environmental noise. Moreover, it can also solve the microphones' mismatch problem and can be applied to both near-field and far-field conditions. Since this method can provide global location and orientation detection, it is suitable to fuse with other localization methods to provide initial conditions for reduction of the search effort, or provide the compensation for localizing certain locations that cannot be detected using other localization methods",

Successful teleoperation depends on how well sensor images taken by the mobile robot are visualized to the user. To enhance the efficiency and the flexibility of the visualization, an image retrieval system on such a robot's image database would be very useful. The main difference of this image retrieval problem from the standard one is that due to variety of viewing conditions, there exist various of relevant images. The main contribution of this paper is to propose an efficient retrieval approach for such a problem by utilizing correlation between visual features and real world locations of images. An active learning technique based on support vector machine is extended for this aim. The second contribution is to present a multi-hypothesis approach to deal with location uncertainty inherent in real world applications",

Consequently useful locomotion capabilities, such as crossing high vertical obstacles, getting self-recovery when the robot is upside-down are achieved.

To mimic the actual flexible fin of a real fish, we model a fin-like mechanism with a series of connecting linkages and attached it to the robotic fish. By virtue of a specially designed strip, each link is able to turn and slide with respect to the adjacent link. The driving linkages are used to form a mechanical fin consisting of several fin segments, which are able to produce undulations, similar to those produced by the actual fins. Owing to the modular design and the flexible structure of the mechanical fin, we were able to construct biomimetic robot fish with various swimming modes by fin undulations. Some qualitative and workspace observations by experiments with the robotic fish are shown and discussed",

        "abstract": "We propose a novel framework for imitation learning that helps a humanoid robot achieve its goal of learning. There are apparent discrepancies in shapes and sizes among humans and humanoid robots. It would be advantageous if robots could learn their behavior from different individuals. Toward this end, this paper discusses appropriate behavior generation method through imitation learning considering that demonstrator and imitator robots have different kinematics and dynamics. As part of a wider interest in behavior generation in general, this work mainly investigates how an imitator robot adapts a reference locomotion gait captured from a demonstrator robot. Specifically, a goal-directed adaptation process that we call self-adjusting adaptor is proposed to achieve stable locomotion of the imitator. The proposed adaptor has an important role that the perceived locomotion patterns are modified to keep the direction of lower leg contacting the ground identical between the demonstrator and the imitator, sustaining the dynamic stability by controlling the position of the center of mass. The validity of the proposed scheme is evaluated through simulations employing various imitator models on OpenHRP and then verified on a real robot",

        "abstract": "This paper investigates motion planning for underactuated systems with impacts, as in legged robots. Some such systems admit decoupling vector fields between impacts, and the system can be thought of as a kinematic system as it moves along the integral curves of these decoupling vector fields. This reduces motion planning to choosing a sequence of decoupling vector fields and impact transition times between these vector fields. Each transition must satisfy the condition that the image of the pre-impact state (through the impact mapping) leads to a post-impact state aligned with the new decoupling vector field. We derive this condition, extending previous work where transitions were only allowed at zero velocity. Our approach combines the benefits of computationally efficient kinematic planning with potentially faster execution times due to the fact that the system does not have to be slowed to zero velocity at the switches. Switches are restricted to a lower-dimensional configuration surface, however. We have applied this approach to motion planning for a planar two-link robot which locomotes by using a single revolute actuator at the joint between the links and by alternately clamping one of two possible pivot points to the ground",

However, the conventional incremental encoder-based methods for estimating speed are prone to poor performance at low speed where the encoder output rate is correspondingly low, leading to a number of research efforts in improved low-speed detection algorithms. To improve speed control performance, a speed detection method based on reduced-order observer is presented in this paper. The observer can interpolate speed and position which is the integration of speed and compared with real data from the encoder when the encoder pulse is detected between encoder pulses. Furthermore, inertia identification based on recursive extended least square algorithm is presented to reduce sensitivity of the speed estimation. Experimental results show that low speed control performance using the reduced-order order is superior to that of conventional one",

        "abstract": "This paper presents recent results in prototyping of a multiscale (macro-micro) robotic assembly platform with modular and reconfigurable characteristics. The system components include precision robots, microstages, end-effectors and fixtures that accomplish assembly tasks in a shared workspace. The system components are systematically characterized in terms of accuracy and repeatability, and assembly plans are performed using kinematic identification, visual servoing, inverse kinematics, and dynamic vibration suppression. As an application packaging problem, various micro and meso scale parts are assembled into a MEMS device. The tolerance budget of assembly ranges from 4 microns to 300 microns, while the size of components in the assembly ranges from 126 microns to 30 mm. Various end-effectors and fixtures have been designed for use with off-the-shelf hardware (robots and microstages) and were tested for precision performance. The robots and the vision system are calibrated to accuracies of 10 microns or less. Inverse kinematics solutions for the robots have been developed in order to position parts in a global coordinate frame. Conclusions are drawn about implementation of calibration, fixturing and visual servoing in order to assemble within the specified tolerance budget",

A micro vehicle capable of both aerial AND terrestrial locomotion would enjoy great utility in first responder and reconnaissance applications. To this end, BioRobots, LLC, University of Florida (UF), Case Western Reserve University, and Naval Postgraduate School (NPS) have undertaken the development of MMALV, the Morphing Micro Air-Land Vehicle. MMALV combines the UF-MAV flexible wing technology with Mini-Whegs terrestrial running gear, developed at Case. Two generations of MMALV have been developed that are capable of flying, landing, walking, and regaining flight by walking off a two-story building. To our knowledge, MMALV is the only vehicle of its size that integrates all of these functions.",

New method of fusion between human motor skill and machine capability is studied to transfer skill from expert to novice. Haptic-enabled Chinese handwriting training system is established as a benchmark platform for studying learning and transfer of motor skill. Perceptible element of haptic skill is proposed to model human motor skill. Four rules of machine-mediated training system are identified according to human's skill learning characteristics. Architecture of a hierarchical hybrid control training system is proposed based on the learning rules. Phantom desktop is used as the haptic interface and haptic-visual feedback is developed for three training modes, which includes facsimile mode, transcribe mode and reciting mode. Human subject experiments validate the proposed training rules. Fusion of human skill and machine capability by haptic-enable multiple signal feedback system is proved effective to train novice to get familiar with Chinese character handwriting skill",

This allowed us to conduct naked-eye experiments. As a result we identify four shape function relations that might partially explain the design of gecko feet. Additionally, we report experimental data, introduce a quantitative concept to compare climbing systems and show a prototype of magnetic hair",

Robots need skills to manipulate deformable objects, in order to take active parts in such space. However, it is difficult for robots to manipulate deformable objects well and possibility of failure to operate deformable objects cannot be denied. Therefore, shape recognition method for deformable object manipulation is required, that has hyper degrees of freedom structures. Thus in this paper, we propose a description method of conditions of ropes using a topological model and knot theory. And, we also propose a recognition method to obtain the structure of rope from sensor information through the CCD cameras when a robot manipulates a rope. The effectiveness of recognition method against a method using three-dimensional data is verified through an experiment",

Firstly, based on the Lagrange method and Hamilton's principle, a dynamic model of the general object-fingers setup has been described as a system of algebraic differential equations composed of ordinary differential equations governing dynamics of the fingers and the object and a set of algebraic constraints governing rigid contacts between two finger-tips and object' surfaces. Secondly, a control algorithm for stable grasping of the object by the pair of fingers has been proposed. Thirdly, another control signal for desired orientation and position of the grasped object has been proposed and asymptotic convergence of the closed dynamics to the desired orientation and position has been analysed. The principle of linear superposition of control signals has been applied to ensure stale grasping while control desired motion. Numerical simulation results have reconfirmed the effectiveness of the proposed control law.",

Our recognition system allows quantitative comparison of similarities among manipulations performed by observing contact state transitions on a palm surface. The system detects the contact states on the palm surface using an attached tactile sensor sheet on a manipulated object. In experiments, familiarization and fatigue are detected by measuring the variance of the manipulation. Experimental results indicate that manipulation can be divided into three periods: learning, familiarization, and fatigue. The results also indicate that variation of the manipulation becomes small when the template is generated by manipulation data during the familiarization period",

But this contribution implies having light structures, leading to significant deformations in dynamic conditions. Based on a prototype built at IFMA and its numerical model, this article shows first the influence of elastic deformations on actuator efforts. In order to validate the numerical model or any other model which takes flexibilities into account, we propose the concept of a dynamic metrology tool, capable of measuring the deformations of the machine's different components during machining movements. This is a hybrid tool built around a camera and an accelerometer. Experimental progress is then described, particularly the work leading to the improvement of camera detection accuracy. The precision obtained to date is 0.02 mm with one target in a field of 300 mm. It can theoretically reach 0.01 mm with three targets instead of one",

        "abstract": "There are many electric power generators employing dynamos. However, most of them require large mechanical energy input at a time to get large electric power output. This task is not easy for elders because of heavy load. Therefore, we aimed to develop a new ubiquitous power generator suited for light power input. In order to generate large electric energy with light force, we propose a new generator mechanism to store mechanical energy using a spiral spring and gears. Large mechanical energy is stored in the spring by iteration of light force input. We designed a mechanism which can store mechanical energy in the spring by rotating an input lever several times with light force. The energy is restored to rotate the dynamo at high speed to generate electric energy efficiently. While restoring the mechanical energy, reverse rotation of the input lever is avoided by the clutch. Analysis as well as experiment of the proposed mechanism was performed here for optimal design of gear train. As an application, a power generation device which generates energy from door motion is shown to see effectiveness of this mechanism",

        "abstract": "To increase the intelligence of mobile robot, various sensors need to be fused effectively to cope with uncertainty induced from both environment and sensors. Combining sonar and vision sensors possesses numerous advantages of economical efficiency and complementary cooperation. Especially, it can remedy false data association and divergence problem of sonar sensors, and overcome low frequency vision based SLAM update caused by computational burden and weakness in illumination changes of vision sensors. In this paper, we propose a SLAM method to join sonar sensors and stereo camera together. It consists of two schemes: extracting robust point and line features from sonar data, and recognizing planar visual objects using multi-scale Harris corner detector and its SIFT descriptor from pre-constructed object database. Fusing sonar features and visual objects through EKF-based SLAM can give correct data association via object recognition and high frequency update via sonar features. As a result, it can increase robustness and accuracy of SLAM in home environment. The performance of the proposed algorithm was verified by experiments in home environment with dynamic obstacles",

This architecture integrates multiple sensor network-friendly mobile robots into a traditional sensor network. Therefore a closed-loop, dynamic adaptive sensor network is formed, which has many desired merits. In this paper, the distributed sensor node localization and the service set partition among multiple micro mobile robots are studied. For the node localization, a potential-based robot area partition algorithm and a distributed localization algorithm are developed respectively. For service set partition, a load-balanced partitioning algorithm is developed, which adapts to the number of active nodes in the field. The proposed algorithms are verified through simulations",

        "abstract": "Robot audition is a critical technology in making robots symbiosis with people. Since we hear a mixture of sounds in our daily lives, sound source localization and separation, and recognition of separated sounds are three essential capabilities. Sound source localization has been recently studied well for robots, while the other capabilities still need extensive studies. This paper reports the robot audition system with a pair of omni-directional microphones embedded in a humanoid to recognize two simultaneous talkers. It first separates sound sources by independent component analysis (ICA) with single-input multiple-output (SIMO) model. Then, spectral distortion for separated sounds is estimated to identify reliable and unreliable components of the spectrogram. This estimation generates the missing feature masks as spectrographic masks. These masks are then used to avoid influences caused by spectral distortion in automatic speech recognition based on missing-feature method. The novel ideas of our system reside in estimates of spectral distortion of temporal-frequency domain in terms of feature vectors. In addition, we point out that the voice-activity detection (VAD) is effective to overcome the weak point of ICA against the changing number of talkers. The resulting system outperformed the baseline robot audition system by 15%",

To date, however, there has been no quantitative analysis to support this assertion. This paper presents the first quantitative support for the argument that larger teams of less-reliable robots can perform certain missions more reliably than smaller teams of more-reliable robots. Our results show that for short missions, in fact, a team of four robots can provide greater mission reliability than a team of two robots, even when the individual robots in the team of four have reliability that is an order of magnitude lower. These results suggest that considerable cost reductions can be achieved for some missions by choosing larger teams of less-reliable robots over smaller teams of more-reliable robots",

The novelty of the work resides in the mission level, which is built with a Petri network that defines the sequence of tasks that are executed depending on the unpredictable situations that may occur. The task control system is composed of a set of active behaviours and a coordinator that selects the most appropriate vehicle action at each moment. The paper focuses on the design of the mission controller and its interaction with the task controller. Simulations, inspired on an industrial underwater inspection of a dam grate, show the effectiveness of the control architecture",

        "abstract": "Human being can decide his walking to auto-adapt to environment changes. Comparing with this, the autonomy of biped robots is inefficient or remains unsolved. One basic reason for this is the less of a unified modeling framework for various types of biped motion in varying environment which allows on-line deriving of the control input In this paper, we propose to recast types of biped motion in the framework of hybrid system, express it as a mixed logic dynamical model. Such a point of view possesses the advantage that it encompasses all the motions (such as single support motion and impact phenomenon) into a unique one, thus allow the control system to be design optimally even though the impact occurs as the interior point of the optimization horizon",

        "track": "main",
        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "A number of methods have been developed for finding collision free paths for a manipulator moving from one configuration to another. In each of these cases the desired goal configuration must be chosen beforehand. However, in most applications there may be more than one configuration that satisfies the desired position and orientation requirements of the end effector. One of these configurations must be chosen for the path planner; generally we want to select the configuration that results in the lowest cost movement from the manipulator's current position. Until the motion plan is calculated, we cannot know which goal configuration to choose. This paper demonstrates a method for selecting the lowest cost path without needing to calculate a motion plan from the start position to all of the possible goal configurations. Generating motion plans is computationally expensive and it is desirable to limit these computations where ever possible. This is especially true in the case of mobile manipulators where the surrounding terrain for the motion planning calculation changes at each step, meaning that computational savings of reusing calculations from previous runs cannot be realised. The method demonstrated in this paper is shown to be much more suited to these types of applications than more traditional motion planning methods",

Compared with other methods using natural/artificial landmark, the proposed localization method has great advantages in cost and appearance, since the location of the robot is perfectly known using the barcode information after the mapping is finished. We also propose a navigation algorithm which uses the topological structure. For the topological information, we define nodes and edges which are suitable for indoor navigation, especially for large area having multiple rooms, many walls and many static obstacles. The proposed algorithm also has an advantage that errors occurred in each node are mutually independent and can be compensated exactly after some navigation using barcode. Simulation and experimental results were performed to verify the algorithm in the barcode environment, and the result showed an excellent performance. After mapping, it is also possible to solve the kidnapped case and generate paths using topological information",

This paper presents a novel method in which the classical Hough transform is introduced into localization of the mobile robot. To reduce ambiguity significantly, an improved more detailed sonar model is utilized. Firstly a local geometric map in the Hough space is built via the sonar system. Then the matching between a known map of the environment and a local map is performed in the Hough space. Finally this matching result is fused with odometry information by means of the extended Kalman filtering. The technique is especially adapted to indoor polygonal environments.

The laser pointer is used as a light source and the light from the laser pointer is reflected in a mirror. The light-ray is projected on a running surface and a scheduled course is drawn by rotating the reflector around the pan and the tilt axes. The preliminary-announcement and display unit of the developed mobile robot can indicate the operation until 3-second-later preliminarily, so the robot moves drawing the scheduled course from the present to 3-second-later. The experiment on coordination between the preliminary-announcement and the movement has been carried out, and we confirmed the correspondence of the announced course with the robot trajectory both in the case that the movement path is given beforehand and in the case that the robot is operated with manual input from a joystick in real-time. So we have validated the coordination algorithm between the preliminary-announcement and the real movement",

To support autonomous navigation, a Miniature Active Camera (MaCam) module is designed, which can be used in the pose calibration of the robot. The robot pose error model is introduced. Based on that, the path planning problem for a single robot is studied and a hierarchical algorithm is developed to generate a path that satisfies the navigation requirements of the robot.

Compared with its rigid-counterpart, a FCPM becomes more complicate in its mobility analysis. In this paper, the screw theory is applied to the mobility analysis of our FCPM as an instance of general FCPM. Firstly, the compliance matrices of both compliant elements and the whole mechanism are calculated by using adjoint transformation of compliance matrix between different coordinate frames. Secondly, the mobility characteristics of the FCPM is investigated by proposing a concept of \"primary mobility of a FCPM\" and a method of quantifying the primary mobility of the FCPM providing that the compliance matrix of the manipulator should be calculated primarily. The theoretical result reveals that mobility characteristics of the FCPM with current design parameters can satisfy the designer's original desire",

        "abstract": "Modal control algorithms have been widely used in suppressing structural vibration, where vibration characteristics are linear and constant. This paper presents experimental work demonstrating the application of modal control to closed-loop mechanisms, where flexible deformation is coupled with nonlinear rigid body motion. A PRR experimental planar parallel robot is used as the test platform. This lightweight planar parallel manipulator is designed to improve operational speed of \"pick-and-place\" processes and implement a \"smart parallel manipulator\" through the integration of a parallel mechanism architecture and active control of linkage vibration using lead zirconate titanate (PZT) transducers. Boundary conditions and mode shapes of intermediate linkage are not conventional due to the fact that the linkages undergo constrained rigid body motion. Experimental modal analysis (EMA) is used to determine the boundary conditions of flexible linkages. However, it is observed that linkage vibration exhibits configuration-dependency. Based on experimental observations, an assumption is taken to simplify the transfer function from the motor input to linkage vibration. Based on this simplification, a modal controller is designed and implemented. Experimental results demonstrate dramatic linkage vibration reduction",

We present kinematic models that explicitly relate the perturbations to the vehicle skidding and slipping. Four configurations of mobile robots are considered and the perturbations due to skidding and slipping are categorically classified as input additive, input multiplicative, and/or matched/unmatched perturbations. These classifications and formulations lay a base for the deployments of various control design techniques to overcome the addressed perturbations",

The system is then used for accurate and non-destructive mechanical characterization based on soft contact interactions on biological samples.

By using this simulator, numerical simulation results of 3-D object pinching and manipulation under the gravity effect based on the control law rendering \"blind grasping\" without use of any object kinematics or any external sensing is carried out in a case that the fingers have excess joints.

To show the usefulness of controlling interaction forces, two exemplary cases are introduced. The first example investigates the interaction force between a mobile platform and a serial robot mounted on the platform. The interaction force between the two modules is controlled so that the motion of the mobile platform can be controlled in a desired way. The second example deals with interaction between a serial robot and a human operator. An interaction force is controlled so that the human operator does not feel uncomfortable when the operator performs a designed trajectory motion in cooperation with the robot",

        "abstract": "Pervasive surveillance can be defined as continuous monitoring and tracking of multiple targets in a large monitored region so that they do not leave the field of view (FOV) of the sensors observing them. Despite the limited sensing capability and range of the individual sensors, the surveillance network can track targets over a large region based on transferring the target tracking task. The challenge for such large scale networked systems is to design an efficient and scalable modeling and analysis tool and devise stable control algorithms for accomplishing the surveillance task. Mutational analysis and shape based control have been proposed to overcome the limitations of current feature (point) based visual servoing techniques, however, they fail to capture the discrete switching nature of the surveillance task of tracking the target using multiple sensors. This paper presents a mutational hybrid model for such pervasive surveillance networks which retains the advantages of using mutational equations while also being able to model the discrete switching between various sensors. We also present an example pervasive surveillance scenario modeled using the proposed method and experimental results verifying the proposed approach",

        "abstract": "Large scale robotic teams are capable of working independently or cooperatively to carry out a variety of missions. However, for large teams of robots to function for extended periods of time, the individual members of a team must be able to generate or find energy to re-supply themselves. One approach to providing power for a robotic team is to couple larger systems with significant energy reserves so that the smaller systems can be recharged directly from the larger. This paper presents an implementation of such an approach. Here, a modular docking station is given locomotion through the cooperation of two larger robots. The docking station is capable of transporting, deploying, retrieving, and recharging many smaller robots. The kinematic model which will govern the cooperation of the maneuvering robots and will be used to develop control is presented and discussed. The design of the individual bays of the docking station and how they facilitate the deployment, recovery, and recharge of the smaller robots is also presented.

        "abstract": "Automated construction is in high demand in many applications in the extreme environments. Fully automatic construction system is desired but difficult to realize for many reasons. We have proposed a novel concept of full-automated construction called automatic modular assembly system (AMAS), which drastically reduces the difficulty of automated construction task. In this paper, we focus on distributed control method of the assembler robots. We assume large number of modules and robots; therefore we need to organize the motion paths of these robots to avoid collision among them. Moreover, the area on which the assembler robots can move dynamically expands during the construction process. In order to optimize the complex coordinated motion among the assembler robots, we introduce a distributed algorithm based on a gradient field. The structure modules generate the gradient field by using neighbor-to-neighbor communication, and the robots are led by the field. Incorporating some additional rules for the field and robots, we can make a kind of self-organized flow on the system, and it enables collision-free and time-effective assembly. Some results of simulations give quantitative evaluation of the algorithm",

        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "Mobile machines equipped with manipulator arm(s) are being increasingly used in a variety of areas of industry. When these mobile utilities perform fast maneuvers, move over rough terrain, manipulate heavy work pieces, or interact large wrenches with their environment, they may go unstable and overturn. Therefore, safety and efficiency of such systems can be improved with a reliable stability recognition metric. For on-line applications, such tip-over stability measure should be computationally simple which makes its presentation a challenging task. In this study, various dynamic stability measures are investigated and compared with each other in terms of their reliability and computational complexity. Then, a new reliable and efficient metric named as Moment-Height Stability (MHS) measure is introduced for mobile manipulators. The proposed metric is a physically meaningful and reliable measure while it contains low computational burden. The MHS measure can be exploited successfully for wheeled mobile manipulators containing single or multiple arms. Besides, by some minor modifications the MHS measure can be also employed for the case of legged locomotion. Also, the proposed MHS measure may be extended for the case of suspended mobile manipulator on rough terrains. Several case studies are presented to reveal the effectiveness of the new MHS measure compared to the main previous measures.",

The stability of the controller is verified with Lyapunov function. A virtual sonar based guidance law is proposed in perception layer to coordinate motions on different dimensions, which originates from the behavior of human beings. In executive layer a kind of thruster configuration for high speed traveling is introduced to handle thrust reduction of tunnel thrusters.

        "abstract": "Simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) builds maps of a priori unknown environments. Whilst this key mobile robotic competency continues to receive substantial attention, less attention has been paid to assessing the quality of the resulting maps. This paper proposes a way to quantify the intrinsic quality of point-cloud maps built from a stream of range bearing measurements. It does so by considering both the temporal and spatial distribution of the points within the map. One of the causes of unsatisfactory maps is the execution of unmodelled or poorly sensed vehicle manoeuvres. In this paper we show that by maximizing the quality of the map as a function of a motion parameterization, the vehicle motion can be recovered while correcting the map at the same time. In contrast to typical scan matching techniques, we do not rely on segmentation of the measurement stream into two separate \"scans\"; Instead we treat the measurement sequence as a continuous signal. We illustrate the efficacy of this approach by processing range data from a 77 GHz millimeter wave radar that completes 2 rotations per second. We show that despite this acquisition speed being commensurate with vehicle rotation rates, we are able to extract the underlying vehicle motion and yield crisp, well aligned point clouds",

        "abstract": "We have proposed a real-time self-collision avoidance motion generation method for the manipulator of the robot used for human-robot cooperation. In this method, we represent the robots' body by using elastic elements referred to as \"RoBE (representation of body by elastic elements)\". The self-collision avoidance could be realized based on a virtual reaction force generated by the contacts between the elastic elements before the actual self-collision of the robot. In this paper, we expand this method to control not only robots' manipulator, but also its mobile base. Furthermore, we focus on the range of the joint movement of the robot, and propose the self-collision avoidance motion generation method considering it. Because of these, the self-collision motions which could deal with task/environmental constraints could be generated on the robot cooperating with a human. The proposed method is implemented in the planar 4-DOF mobile manipulator, and computer simulations are done for illustrating the validity of it",

In this paper, the reflexes that highly adapt and control the movement of the humanoid robot when a large disturbance occurs is considered. The structure of the reflex system is proposed combined with the walking motion generator. Our approach to generate a rhythmic motion does not require complex dynamics models. It is based on linear oscillators and provides flexibility in introducing reflexes. In order to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed system, the humanoid robot HOAP-3 of Fujitsu is used. It is shown that a reflex movement is successfully integrated with the rhythmic motion in the following case; sudden change in the floor level, sudden change in load, and presence of a large disturbance. As a result, the proposed reflex system contributes toward the safe interaction of the humanoid robots with the environment",

The study concentrates on the landing phase of the jump which is the most demanding for the system because of high discontinuity of acceleration at impact time. We first decompose the motion in two functions. The first one starts just before landing and consists in maximizing the value of the discontinuity by reducing the feet/ground velocity. We set the feet, COM and feet/COM velocities according to the supposed height of the jump. At impact time, the second function uses measured data of Ground Reaction Force (GRF) from the ankle force sensors to quickly stop the system while keeping its vertical equilibrium. The influence of each function and their respective parameters is discussed and analyzed, and their validity is tested using the model of an existing humanoid platform.",

        "abstract": "This paper focuses on development of a motion planning strategy for car-like vehicles in dynamic urban-like scenarios. The strategy can be summarized as a search for a collision-free trajectory among linearly moving obstacles applying rapidly-exploring random trees (RRT) and B-splines. Collision avoidance is based on geometric search in transformed state space of chained form kinematic model decomposition. The time criterion for avoiding obstacles is based on relative robot to obstacle motion and is checked iteratively for possible collisions within the RRT exploration phase. The line segment geometric path is interpolated with a B-spline curve in order to generate a feasible trajectory that takes into account nonholonomic constraints. The exploration strategy aims at finding an optimal steering and longitudinal control of the vehicle in minimum time and steering activity sense. In order to test the strategy a MatLab based simulator was developed. This simulator reproduces a simple 2D urban-like environment with parked and moving cars, buses, trucks, people, buildings, streets, and trees. The test vehicle, a modified smart car equipped with several sensors was kinematically modeled. The sensor data are extracted from the environment based on its geometrical description and used as input data for the motion planning strategy which was verified in a dynamic urban scenario simulation",

This paper proposes the motion planning for object grasping under the previous explained conditions. There are two major issues to detect the robot pose. The first problem is pose error of the robot hand. The second problem is kinematical redundancy of the mobile manipulator. The pose is evaluated from the amount of joint motions for recovery of hand pose error. Experiments show the effectiveness of the proposed method.",

We modeled a humanoid robot as a simple dynamic system consists of ZMP (zero-moment point) and COG (center of gravity) as its states. The emergency stop motion is generated by a state feedback. We determined optimal feedback gains in terms of the initial conditions and the pole assignment. The proposed method realized a reliable emergency stop with low computational cost. Furthermore, it can easily predict the possibility of the successful emergency stop at any time. The validity of the proposed method is confirmed by an experiment using humanoid robot HRP-2",

We also propose a simple and effective method of real-time pattern generation to force humanoids to stop immediately by one step without falling.

Moreover, a distributed topology control algorithm to improve the robustness metric of groups of robots by increasing the communication range temporarily is presented. When the new topology is constructed and is stable, the range for communicating is reduced to the original value. Finally, the results of simulation experiments have demonstrated the efficiency of the proposed control algorithm while robots and connections fail in a robot group",

        "abstract": "In the present paper, we introduce a new method by which to generate motions having flight phases such as jumping or running. Such motions are expected to expand the speed and stability of legged robots. Motions with flight phases are examined with respect to jumping, stability and implementation. A novel method of determining the center of mass (COM) and foot locations is proposed that is independent of the target robot actuators or assignments of joints. Moreover, the proposed method allows an on-line system to be built easily and is useful for actual robots. A one-legged jumping robot having a toe joint is built in order to demonstrate the feasibility of this method. Using the toe joint of the robot, the proposed method can reduce the angular velocities of the joints remarkably. Experiments are conducted to investigate the control of the direction, velocity and turning of the robot",

This paper presents a robust technique for detecting moving objects using a laser ranger mounted on a mobile robot. The proposed method uses two consecutive laser range scans to detect the moving objects in the environment. After the initial alignment of the two laser scans, each laser reading is segmented and classified according to object type, stationary, non-stationary or indeterminate. Laser reading segments are then analyzed using an algorithm to maximally recover the moving objects. The proposed algorithm has the ability to recover all possible laser readings that belong to moving objects. The developed algorithm is verified using experimental results.",

The proposed method considers only particular viewpoint(s) of a car for classifying similar car and/or non-car. We obtain three different views (rear, side and front views) of cars and develop an eigendatabase. This paper shows that eigenspaces are well separated with respect to the car views and, therefore, car and non-car can easily be classified using the respective eigen subspaces. We then generalize the respective eigenspaces taking a mean of the respective feature points. Since the car eigenspace finally contains only the feature of obtained views, it makes our approach very simple and computationally inexpensive. For the classification, we also present a new matching algorithm based on eigendimension for classifying car and non-car. The proposed classifier is compared with Euclidean and Mahalanobis distance-based classifier, and experimental results from the real world scenes show the effectiveness of the proposed method",

        "abstract": "In this paper we present a novel approach to estimating the position of objects tracked by a team of mobile robots and to use these objects for a better self localization. Modeling of moving objects is commonly done in a robo-centric coordinate frame because this information is sufficient for most low level robot control and it is independent of the quality of the current robot localization. For multiple robots to cooperate and share information, though, they need to agree on a global, allocentric frame of reference. When transforming the egocentric object model into a global one, it inherits the localization error of the robot in addition to the error associated with the egocentric model. We propose using the relation of objects detected in camera images to other objects in the same camera image as a basis for estimating the position of the object in a global coordinate system. The spatial relation of objects with respect to stationary objects (e.g., landmarks) offers several advantages: a) Errors in feature detection are correlated and not assumed independent. Furthermore, the error of relative positions of objects within a single camera frame is comparably small, b) The information is independent of robot localization and odometry. c) As a consequence of the above, it provides a highly efficient method for communicating information about a tracked object and communication can be asynchronous, d) As the modeled object is independent from robo-centric coordinates, its position can be used for self localization of the observing robot. We present experimental evidence that shows how two robots are able to infer the position of an object within a global frame of reference, even though they are not localized themselves and then use this object information for self- localization",

        "abstract": "Mean shift, for its simplicity and efficiency, has achieved a considerable success in robot tracking. For the mean shift based tracking algorithm, the scale of the mean-shift kernel bandwidth is a crucial parameter which reflects the size of tracking window. However, in literature how to properly update or select the bandwidth remains a tough task as the size of the object under consideration changes. In this paper, a weighted average integral projection approach is proposed to extract the local information of the object, and then a multiinformation fusion strategy is suggested for the scale selection, which combines both the global and local information of the sample weight image. Moreover, a coarse-to-fine approximate approach is employed to accelerate the procedure. Experimental results demonstrate that, compared to some existing works, the strategy proposed has a better adaptability as the size of the object changes in clutter environments.",

        "abstract": "To operate outdoors or on non-flat surfaces, mobile robots need appropriate data structures that provide a compact representation of the environment and at the same time support important tasks such as path planning and localization. One such representation that has been frequently used in the past are elevation maps which store in each cell of a discrete grid the height of the surface in the corresponding area. Whereas elevation maps provide a compact representation, they lack the ability to represent vertical structures or even multiple levels. In this paper, we propose a new representation denoted as multi-level surface maps (MLS maps). Our approach allows to store multiple surfaces in each cell of the grid. This enables a mobile robot to model environments with structures like bridges, underpasses, buildings or mines. Additionally, they allow to represent vertical structures. Throughout this paper we present algorithms for updating these maps based on sensory input, to match maps calculated from two different scans, and to solve the loop-closing problem given such maps. Experiments carried out with a real robot in an outdoor environment demonstrate that our approach is well-suited for representing large-scale outdoor environments",

Using a single unified formulation, a number of design objectives can be simultaneously optimized through searching in the parameter space. Compared with two main strategies, as Thermostatic and single-objective genetic algorithm (SOGA), the computation procedures of MOGA are discussed.

Our experimental results show that this new strategy significantly improves upon the reliability of the decoupled planning approach. Overall in our tests, the new strategy outperforms both the centralized and decoupled planning approach, indicating that in practice it can be a better choice, than both the centralized and decoupled approach, for solving multi-robot planning problems",

        "abstract": "This paper proposes a multi-stage approach for landmine detection. It is based on a feature-level data fusion which combines data from several nonspecific sensors. The sensor fusion process is analysed and divided in three stages in order to improve the final result. During the first stage all suspected objects are detected against a background. Then, the detected objects are classified to be a man-made or natural object. And, finally, the landmines are distinguished among the identified manmade objects. The last two stages are described in detail in this paper, demonstrating the advantages for their separation. Classification features, which enable the sensor fusion, are also presented in this work together with an approach for their integration. The proposed ideas are tested using real experimental data obtained from pulsed and continuous metal detectors, infrared camera and ground penetrating radar",

The agent embodies the state and logic relationship between the person which the agent represents and the others in the same group. It does not merely stand for such individual information of persons as given by the existing surveillance systems. The results of experiments show that by using our multi-agent approach to compute and analyze the relationship between a number of agents, we can well perform real-time surveillance for the group and the related events so as to enhance the applicability and intelligence level of surveillance systems",

        "abstract": "The limited power, low radio range, and an ever changing environment make the ability to explicitly communicate between multi-robots decreases in a searching task. When this happens, maintaining the weakened connection will cause robots to cluster during searching, which may be suboptimal with respect to the searching time. In this paper, several integration strategies are proposed to coordinate a team of robots which have limited explicit communication. To speed up the reconnection procedure for the proposed aggregate strategies, implicit communication through vision sensors is proposed in this paper to establish a movement plan to recover the explicit communication. Simulation results are presented and discussed; The real-world experiments with 3 Pioneer robots have been conducted. The proposed strategies can be extended to a large-scale searching environment as well as a combination of humans and robots",

The second one is the Team Q-learning algorithm, which is a multi-agent reinforcement learning algorithm, and is proved to converge to the optimal policy. The states, actions, and reward function of the algorithms are presented in the paper. Based on the two Q-learning algorithms, a fully distributed multi-robot system is developed. Computer simulations are carried out using the developed system. The simulation results show that the two algorithms are effective in a simple environment. It is shown, however, that the single-agent Q-learning algorithm does a better job than the Team Q-learning algorithm in a complicated and unknown environment with many obstacles.",

For a target tracking and interception task, the sensor network continuously tracks the targets and dynamically selects robots to intercept the target. The robots are navigated through the sensor network. The main contribution of this paper lies on providing a scalable, power saving robot selection algorithm for the sensor networks. The robot selection algorithm is addressed based on partitioning among sensor nodes. Through partitioning, the sensor nodes are grouped so that they know which robot to choose if it is the closest to the target. The partitioning is updated with respect to the movement of robots. The proposed algorithms are proven to be effective and verified by simulations. Some analytic investigation on the communication overhead in the sensor networks is also provided",

        "abstract": "This paper presents a new approach to the multi-robot map-alignment problem that enables teams of robots to build joint maps without initial knowledge of their relative poses. The key contribution of this work is an optimal algorithm for merging (not necessarily overlapping) maps that are created by different robots independently. Relative pose measurements between pairs of robots are processed to compute the coordinate transformation between any two maps. Noise in the robot-to-robot observations, propagated through the map-alignment process, increases the error in the position estimates of the transformed landmarks, and reduces the overall accuracy of the merged map. When there is overlap between the two maps, landmarks that appear twice provide additional information, in the form of constraints, which increases the alignment accuracy. Landmark duplicates are identified through a fast nearest-neighbor matching algorithm. In order to reduce the computational complexity of this search process, a kd-tree is used to represent the landmarks in the original map. The criterion employed for matching any two landmarks is the Mahalanobis distance. As a means of validation, we present experimental results obtained from two robots mapping an area of 4,800 m2",

        "abstract": "This paper describes a new acoustic localization method using audible sound, which can be applied over a broader range of search directions. In the field of robotics, most conventional indoor localization systems based on sonar range finders use ultrasound to obtain a highly accurate distance. Because ultrasound has high directivity, many measurements are required to localize objects in a large space. To achieve localization with one-time measurement, we use audible sounds. We then calculate an intensity field of the reflection sound to estimate object positions. Although acoustical holography (AH) is a well-known technique to do this, it has problems in that it generates false images. We propose multiple AH (MAH) to solve this problem. The method is used to divide a measurement plane into sub-planes and to apply AH to each sub-plane. By integrating the results of applying AH to the sub-planes, false images can be suppressed because the positions of the false images differ depending on the position of the sub-plane. In addition, we use multiple frequencies to advance an accuracy of the localization based on MAH in a real environment. We constructed a localization system with only one speaker and a microphone array. In both simulation and actual experiments, we confirmed that MAH was effective method for the suppression of false image and could be used within the range of an angle view of 120 deg",

In this paper we present an algorithm for tracking clusters of people using multiple hypothesis tracking (MHT). The motivation for our approach is that tracking clusters of objects instead of the individual objects enhances the reliability and robustness of the tracking especially when the objects move in groups. To efficiently keep track of multiple objects and clusters, our approach uses MHT in combination with Murty's algorithm. The set of hypothesis for each iteration is constructed in two consecutive steps: one for solving the data association problem, taking also into account the frequent occlusions between the objects, and the second one for considering the joining of different clusters. Our approach has been implemented and tested on a real robot and in a typical hallway environment. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach can robustly deal with several groups of people and is able to reliably manage the splits and joins of clusters",

        "abstract": "Multiple Impedance control (MIC) enforces designated impedance on all cooperating manipulators, the manipulated object, and the spacecraft of a space free flying robotic system to manipulate a grasped object, and move it on a desired path. However, during such maneuvers, some inner forces and torques are usually produced in the object. For tuning the inner object forces, it is needed to model the inner forces/torques or their effects on the object. In this paper, a virtual linkage model is introduced to determine the inner forces using the MIC law. Also, the load distribution between end-effectors is modeled. To this end, the MIC law is used to control both path tracking and inner forces tuning when manipulating an object. The moving object is grasped solidly with two 6 degrees of freedom (DOF) cooperating end-effectors mounted on a 6 DOF spacecraft appended with a 2 DOF antenna. An explicit dynamics model of this highly complicated 20 DOF system is derived using SPACEMAPLE, and then simulated in MATLAB. The MIC law controls the resulting deflection in the object due to tension or compression forces, also torsion and bending moments besides its motion on a desired path. The obtained results reveal good tracking performance of the proposed MIC controller, besides tuning the object internal forces.",

        "abstract": "This paper aims to track multiple people in a multicamera system for cluttered environment which can be divided into two important parts: one is tracking multiple people in a single camera environment, and the other is tracking multiple people in a multi-camera environment. In a single camera environment, we apply the motion detector and the ellipse algorithm to detect a new person intruding the surveillance area. Then, we utilize the template matching and the ellipse matching to track the person. To prevent tracking failure when people cross over each other, we include the hereby proposed joint visual probabilistic data association filter (JVPDAF) to track multiple people successfully. In a multi-camera environment, the major problem is to determine whether the new person intruding into some surveillance area of a camera is an identified person by some other camera or not. To resolve the aforementioned problem, we propose an approach called consistence labeling. After such labeling process, we track this person by the JVPDA algorithm. Finally, effectiveness of this tracking algorithm is validated via extensive experiments",

        "abstract": "The paper describes a 2D sound source mapping system for a mobile robot. We developed a multiple sound sources localization method for a mobile robot with a 32 channel concentric microphone array. The system can separate multiple moving sound sources using direction localization. Directional localization and separation of different pressure sound sources is achieved using the delay and sum beam forming (DSBF) and the frequency band selection (FBS) algorithm. Sound sources were mapped by using a wheeled robot equipped with the microphone array. The robot localizes sounds direction on the move and estimates sound sources position using triangulation. Assuming the movement of sound sources, the system set a time limit and uses only the last few seconds data. By using the random sample consensus (RANSAC) algorithm for position estimation, we achieved 2D multiple sound source mapping from time limited data with high accuracy. Also, moving sound source separation is experimentally demonstrated with segments of the DSBF enhanced signal derived from the localization process",

An Interlaced extended Kalman filter is shown to be a good solution to the problem of estimating the pose of a team of robots with a fully decentralized algorithm. Moreover, it is feasible to dynamically \"correct\" the estimation autonomously evaluated by each single robot, updating this quantity anytime two robots randomly come across. The algorithm combines the robustness of a full state EKF with the simplicity of its interlaced implementation. It does not need global supervision, and allows a large flexibility in using exteroceptive sensors. The paper presents some simulations to show the feasibility of the approach considering a set of robots equipped with different combinations of sensors and with wireless communication devices able to support data exchange when they are sufficiently close",

        "abstract": "Many environmental applications require high temporal frequency (rapidly changing) and spatially distributed phenomena to be sampled with high fidelity. This requires mobile sensing elements to perform guided sampling in regions of high variability. We propose a multiscale approach for efficiently sampling such phenomena. This approach introduces a hierarchy of sensors according to the sampling fidelity, spatial coverage, and mobility characteristics. In this paper, we report the development of a two-tier multiscale system where information from a low-fidelity, high spatial (global) sensor actuates a mobile robotic node, carrying a high-fidelity, low spatial coverage (spot measurement) sensor, to perform guided sampling in the regions of high phenomenon variability. As a case study of the proposed multiscale paradigm, we investigated the spatiotemporal distribution of the light intensity in a forest understory. The performance of the multiscale approach is verified in simulation and on a physical system. Results suggest that our approach is adequate for the problem of high-frequency spatiotemporal phenomena sampling and significantly outperforms traditional sampling approaches such as a raster scan",

This paper presents a multisensor integration strategy for source declaration subsumed in a behavior based control architecture with several individual behaviors. The performance of the proposed strategy is evaluated using a simulated turbulent fluid environment. The results show that, for 1000 test runs, the proposed strategy reaches a success rate in declaring the odor source of 98% and an average error of the declared source location about 3.27 meters in an operation area with length scales of 100 meter. Source verification is developed using a fuzzy reasoning based segmentation algorithm to recognize the odor source in color images acquired by a visual sensor in the vicinity of the odor source.",

Unsupervised learning of a nonparametric sensing model by maximizing mutual information between signal streams is used to relate information from different sensors, allowing unknown sensor registration and calibration to be determined. Experiments conducted in an office environment are used to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed technique. Two laser sensors are used to capture people mobbing in an arbitrarily manner in the environment and MI from a number of attributes of the motion are used for relating the signal streams from the sensors. Thus the sensor registration and calibration is achieved without using artificial patterns or pre-specified motions",

        "abstract": "We report a single tungsten nanowire successfully grown by controlling the distance between the emitter and substrates with a robotic nanomanipulator moved at a speed of 15 nm/s. When we draw the emitter far from the substrates during electron emission, the longest nanowire at the tip can grow continually, because the electron field at the tip is stronger than the other parts of nanowires. Although multiple nanowires grow at the beginning, the result is that only one nanowire can grow continually at the tip of carbon nanotubes (CNTs). We also show tree-like nanowires on the tip of a CNT without inter-electrode control. These nanowires were induced by field emission, with tungsten hexacarbonyl as precursors. The nanowire's geometric properties were characterized with transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and its composition was detected with TEM energy dispersive X-ray spectrometry (EDS). The EDS spectrum showed that the nanowires are mainly made of tungsten and carbon. The degradation of CNT emitter is an important problem and influences the device's stability and lifetime. We propose that the growth of nanowires can be used for modifying degraded emitters",

        "abstract": "This paper presents a method of generating natural-looking motion primitives for humanoid robots. An optimization-based approach is used to generate these primitives, but the objective function is tailored to each one and complexity is reduced by identifying relevant degrees of freedom. Several examples are shown in simulation: for an arm movement to reach an object, it is better to minimize the acceleration of key parts of the robot over its entire trajectory; for a single step on flat ground, it is better to minimize the torque and instantaneous angular momentum at every posture. The primitives are precomputed off-line, but might be used by on-line planner either to provide a fixed set of maneuvers or to bias a probabilistic, sample-based search for motions",

        "abstract": "For a service robot to be more human friendly, it is required to have various emotional interactions with human. Inspired from both neuroscience and cognitive science, this paper proposes a dynamic robot affective system that can have various emotional states at the same time and express those combined emotions just like humans do. The system comprises three modules: an appraisal module, an emotion-generation module, and an emotional expression module. The appraisal module has responsibility for gathering environmental information and evaluating whether external stimuli are rewarding or punishing. Based on the appraisal results and the homeostasis, the emotion-generation module generates affective states of the robot. The emotional expression module, then, combines and expresses emotional behaviors in accordance with the current affective states (e.g., producing facial expressions). As a result, the robot affective system can generate various emotions simultaneously and produces various emotional expressions continuously, just like human's sequential or parallel execution of emotional behaviors",

The proposed model is compared with a triangular cell map based method proposed by Oh et al. (2004), which combined distance transform path planning, wall-following algorithm, and template based technique. Our method does not need any templates, even in unknown environments. A local map composed of rectangular cells is built through the proposed neural dynamics during CCN with restricted sensory information in unknown environments. The robot is able to dynamically build an accurate map of its immediate limited surroundings for its navigation. Comparison studies to triangular cell map based CCN approach show that the proposed model is capable of planning more reasonable and shorter coverage path in unknown environments",

Multi-fingered haptic interface is required to be safe, to work in wide operation space, and to present not only force at contact points but also weight feeling of virtual objects, to have no oppressive feeling when it is attached to humans, and to have no weight feeling of itself. The paper presents two control methods for the multifingered haptic interface, which is a redundant robot. First is redundant force control, which takes into account moments at tip of an interface arm. The second is a combination of the force control of the fingers and the position control of the arm, which optimizes the manipulability of haptic hand and minimizes variation of joint angles of the interface arm. Experimental results of free space and constrained space are shown. The control methods are well suited not only for the multi-fingered haptic interface but also for the multi-fingered robot hand for grasping and manipulating an object",

These characteristics considerably reduce the dependence on other sensors which are required for recognizing objects.

        "abstract": "Sliding mode control has been used extensively in robotics to cope with parametric uncertainty and hard nonlinearities, in particular for time-delay teleoperators, which have gained gradual acceptance due to technological advancements. However, since the slave teleoperator is in contact to a rigid environment, the slave controller requires a free of chattering control strategy, thus making first order sliding mode teleoperation control unsuitable. As an alternative, chattering free, higher-order sliding mode teleoperator control is proposed in this paper to guarantee robust tracking under unknown constant time delay. Moreover, complete order observers are proposed to avoid measurement of velocity and acceleration, along with a formal closed-loop stability proof of the observer-based controller. Experimental results are presented and discussed, which reveals the effectiveness of the proposed teleoperation scheme",

        "abstract": "In this paper, we propose and implement a formation control algorithm for a mobile robot group. Although obstacle avoidance is a highly essential function, it is not compatible with maintaining a formation. In previous studies, robots often switched their motion algorithms. However, there no concrete criteria exists for such decisions. In this paper, we employ the synchronization of nonlinear oscillators that communicate with each other. By using sensor signals, we vary the phase gaps among the oscillators. According to these phase gaps, we change gains to form a group in order to avoid obstacles. We have implemented the proposed system using actual robotic systems and have demonstrated its feasibility",

        "abstract": "A method for limb mechanism robots of omni-directional gait hanging from grid-like structure is proposed. Grid-like structure consists of many bars assembled in a matrix in a horizontal plane; its grid spacing is not always constant and unknown. A robot has six legs, and each foot has a hemispherical shape for hooking on the bar. The robot moves in any direction as commanded by tripod gait; it hangs from the grid-like structure using two sets of three legs alternately. The leg gropes for the bar so as to take as long stroke as possible. By increasing joint compliance, the foot contacts the bar softly and detects the contact. Then, using a foot force sensor, the robot ascertains that the foot hooks on the bar. The developed robot ASTERISK can perform omni-directional gait hanging from experimental grid-like structure by the proposed method",

        "abstract": "This paper focuses on a sensory-motor control mechanism in human reaching movements from the perspective of robotics. By formulating a musculo-skeletal redundant system which takes into account a nonlinear muscle property and performing numerical simulations, we suggest that the human-like reaching movements can be realized by using only simple task-space feedback scheme together with the internal force effect coming from nonlinear property of muscles without any complex mathematical computation such as an inverse dynamics or some optimal trajectory derivation. Firstly, we introduce both kinematics and dynamics of a three-link serial manipulator with six monoarticular muscles and three biarticular muscles model whose movements are limited within a horizontal plane. Secondly, the nonlinear muscle property coming from a physiological study based on Hill's muscle model, is taken into consideration. This nonlinearity makes it possible to modulate the damping effect in joint-space by considering the internal force generated by the redundant muscles. By utilizing this feature, the end-point converges to the desired point using only simple task-space feedback control scheme, even thought the system owns both the joint and muscle redundancies. Finally, we illustrate numerical simulations to show the effectiveness of the control scheme, and suggest one of the direction to study brain-motor control mechanism of human movements",

To cope with these advanced requirements a new multi-sensor based discrete-continuous supervisory control concept is proposed, which is able to accomplish even complex human skills. Each skill is divided into a sequence of primitive skills (PS). Depending on the multisensor perception of the robot state, the discrete control has to provide an optimal selection and activation of different PS. On the other hand the continuous control has to assure that each PS is performed by means of the most appropriate sub-controllers.

        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "Grasp quality measures are important for understanding how to plan for and maintain appropriate and secure grasps for pick and place operations and tool use. Most grasp quality measures assume certain symmetries about the mechanism or the task. For example, contact points may be considered to be independent and identical, or an ellipsoidal measure such as the force manipulability ellipsoid may be used. However, many tasks have strong asymmetries, where wrenches in certain directions dominate. Tendon driven hand designs may also have strong asymmetries, leading to differing abilities to apply contact forces in different directions. This paper begins to explore empirically the validity of some of the symmetry assumptions employed by common grasp quality metrics. We examine the human hand and the shadow robot hand, and find that force abilities vary with finger choice and with location of the contact on the finger for both hands. However, while the human hand shows dramatic changes for different poses due to its asymmetric design, the shadow hand, with a symmetric design shows much smaller changes and resembles the assumption of identical and independent contact points reasonably well. Thus, we suggest that the underlying design of the hand is a very important factor to consider for grasp quality metrics and for grasp planning and control. The specific grasp quality metric we study in this paper also brings together a variety of previous research. We outline a linear programming approach for computing a grasp quality metric that includes tendon force constraints and contact constraints and can handle any task described as a polytope in wrench space",

        "abstract": "Simultaneous localization and mapping problem for mobile robots has received considerable attention over the last decade. The widely used formulation of the SLAM problem has been the augmented state approach in an estimation theoretic framework. Although, many related issues of SLAM such as computational complexity, loop closing and data association have received much attention, the observability issue has largely remained ignored. System observability is an important aspect in any state estimation problem. Observability analysis provides for understanding of the fundamental limits of the solution obtainable, regardless of process and measurement noises. The standard world-centric SLAM formulation is a highly non-linear system. Thus the direct use of linear observability tools and criteria in the analysis of its observability yields incorrect and inconsistent results. In this paper an appropriate method of analysis of the observability of non-linear systems is applied to investigate the properties of the standard SLAM formulation. Contrary to popular belief, it is shown through theoretical analysis that the standard 2D planar world-centric SLAM formulation involving odometry inputs for robot speed and heading, and range/bearing measurements to features in the environment is unobservable. It is also shown that for the system to be observable, it requires at least two absolutely known feature point positions, thus questioning the very meaning implied by SLAM. The analytical results thus established are verified through simulations.",

        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "When one joint of a manipulator fails and is locked, the velocities of remaining joints will produce sudden change. The sudden change of joint velocity in fault tolerant operation of two coordinating manipulators for locked joint failures is studied. First, the difference between the joint velocity of original manipulator and that of reduced manipulator is defined as the sudden change in joint velocity. Then, a corresponding fault tolerant planning algorithm based on this index is proposed. At last, numerical and solid simulations of fault tolerant operations for two spatial 4R manipulators are implemented. Simulation results show that the initial postures of the two manipulators heavily affect the sudden change in joint velocity. The algorithm proposed in this paper can decide the optimal posture with minimum sudden change in joint velocity, strengthen manipulators' motion stability and so improve their kinematical and dynamic properties in fault tolerant operations",

        "abstract": "Cast aluminum wheels must be deburred and polished before chrome plating operation. Manual deburring and polishing is tedious and monotonous. Industrial robots are attracting more and more attention for the deburring applications. However, Each wheel path program was taking eight to ten weeks to create because the position and orientation of the deburring tool must be accurately identified based on the curvature of the wheel. To solve this problem, we developed a practical 6 DOF robot path generation method using hybrid force and visual servoing methodology. The force servoing keeps the robot tool continuously contacting with the wheel surface and the visual servoing controls the robot tool to follow a marked tool path on the wheel while the position and orientation are controlled and recorded. A robot path is then generated from the recorded data. Experiments are performed and the experimental results demonstrate that the developed algorithm can be used to automatically generate accurate 6 DOF robot paths for deburring aluminum wheels in less than an hour. This significantly reduces the robot programming time. The developed technology can also be used for robot path generation in many other manufacturing applications, such as welding and strip painting",

        "abstract": "To ensure safety of railway operation, it is important to regularly check railway conditions such as deformation of the rails. To monitor rail deformation, this paper presents a method for detecting sources of vibrations a running train on-line by measuring accelerations, which include the train bogie's lateral acceleration, and the crossbeam's lateral and vertical accelerations. A series of detection algorithms including peak-peak value entropy comparison, weighted correlation coefficients comparison etc. are proposed in the method, according to different characters of vibrations from train itself and rail deformation. To eliminate the vibration due to the train itself, the algorithm employs the peak-peak value entropy comparison. To identify the order of the vibrations between crossbeam and bogie, a weighted correlation coefficient is applied. Weight center and maximum position are used to detect at last. The algorithms were implemented on a passenger train using ARM processor and real experiments were conducted on the train on the railway between Shenyang and Dalian in China. The experiments demonstrated that the proposed method can produce satisfactory results.",

To evaluate the avoidance ability of the intermediate links, a scalar value of avoidance manipulability shape index (AMSI) was proposed, which is independent of the obstacle's shape. On the other hand, the danger to crash to the obstacle is depending on the shape of the obstacle, which could be evaluated by the potential field set around the obstacle. This paper just proposes a control method of the manipulator's shape based on avoidance manipulability shape index with potential (AMSIP) to simultaneously avoid obstacle and keep the avoidance ability high while tracking the hand trajectory",

These approaches work only with reference points, which may be any artificial marks, or any parts of objects fixed in the working environment. Regardless of whether the camera pose is changed by mistake or because of system re-design, the camera will observe the reference points after the change, the recalibration for the camera pose will be completed in a few seconds, and the camera can immediately be reintegrated into the vision system. Compared to the results from a measuring device with a laser tracker and a famous industrial vision system, the accuracy of the recalibration methods with real data completely satisfies the practical demands.",

It is extremely difficult to solve scheduling problems due to high frequency of disturbance occurrence. This paper proposes a new approach for the online manufacturing rescheduling method. Instead of having a dispatching process based on dispatching rules once again, we revise the existing schedule based on message passing principle once the disturbance occurs, and improve the performance of the revised schedule by the introduction of a quick local search according to permutations of processes on semi-critical paths. The proposed method can release the influence of disturbances in less than 1 second, and finish rescheduling process in less than 1 minute. Through the actual problems with about 200,000 processes, this method is evaluated to be more effective for actual manufacturing than the dispatching-rule based methods, some of which have been applied in many facilities",

        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "Mobile robots need maps or other forms of geometric information about the environment to navigate. The mobility sensors (LADAR, stereo, etc.) on these robotic vehicles can however populate these maps only up to a distance of a few tens of meters. A navigation system has no knowledge about the world beyond this sensing horizon. As a result, path planners that rely only on this knowledge are unable to anticipate obstacles sufficiently early and have no choice but to resort to an inefficient local obstacle avoidance behavior. However, recent developments in the computer vision community allows us to collect geometric information about the environment far beyond this sensing horizon. The coarse 3D geometric estimation that can be recovered is derived from an appearance-based model. That uses a multiple-hypothesis framework to robustly estimate scene structure from a single image and estimating confidences for each geometric label. This 3D geometric estimation is used with a previously presented navigation strategy that reasons about sensor constraints and plans for measurements while navigating towards the goal. The validity of the sensing method and navigation strategy is supported by results from simulations as well as field experiments with a real robotic platform. These results also show that significant reduction in path length can be achieved by using this framework",

The impact shocks from rapid footfalls, pivotal for such mobility, introduce large impulses that saturate motion measurement. A biomimetic approach is presented in which visual information, in the form of optical flow, complements information from inertial sensors. The motion is then determined using a two-phase Hybrid Extended Kalman Filter. Experimentation in determining attitudes on a robotic leg platform shows a reduction in drift over inertial approaches and in delay over visual approaches. In tests with 6g impulses, pose was recovered within 5 deg rms with angular rate errors limited to 10 deg/sec at frequencies up to 250 Hz.",

        "abstract": "One of the most challenging tasks for satellite on-orbit servicing is to rendezvous and capture a non-cooperative satellite such as a tumbling satellite. This paper presents an optimal control strategy for a servicing spacecraft to rendezvous (in close range) with a tumbling satellite. The strategy is to find an optimal trajectory which will guide the servicing spacecraft to approach the tumbling satellite such that the two vehicles will eventually have no relative rotation. Therefore, a subsequent docking or capture operation can be safely performed. Pontryagin's maximum principle is applied in generation of the optimal approaching trajectory and the corresponding set of control force/torque profiles. A planar satellite chasing problem is presented as a case study, in which together with the maximum principle, the Lie algebras associated with the system are used to examine the existence of singular extremals for optimal control. Optimal trajectories for minimum fuel consumption are numerically simulated",

To evaluate the object direction, we focus on the norm of contact forces consisting of the normal forces and friction forces. We conclude that the norm of contact force become minimal when vertical line through the center of mass of the object (i.e., gravitational line) shoots out the midpoint of two contact points in 2D space, while it does the centroid of the contact-point triangles in 3D space",

This paper attempts at providing evidence to the fact that loose guide method is an approach to optimal guidance in the sense that when the control (constrain) of ORTW-II motion is loose, its motion pattern significantly resembles user's unconstrained motion. Healthy user's natural motion is hypothesized to be optimal and is compared with constrained motion pattern of ORTW-II for different settings of the potential canal.

        "abstract": "By modeling the networked robot system (NRS) that drops packets randomly, we considered the problem of optimal linear quadratic Gaussian (LQG) control and analyzed the stability of a NRS. We presented a mathematical model based on a packet-based setting, extended the familiar LQG separation principle that allows us to solve this problem using a standard LQR state-feedback design, proposed an optimal algorithm irrespective of the packet drop pattern by constructing an encoder for the unreliable channel and designing the decoder that uses the information it receives across the link to construct an estimate of the state of the networked robot. For the case of packet drops occurring according to a Markov chain, the stability analysis was carried out. Because the separation theorem for linear systems and quadratic cost does not apply to the general framework of NRSs, we used the uncertainty threshold principle to show that under certain conditions there was a rate for dropped packets for which an undisturbed networked control system with imperfect state observation was mean square stable, used a sub-optimal method to simplify the calculation of the estimator and controller, got the solution to the Riccati-like equation and guaranteed the mean square stability of the NRS with perfect state information. This design does not assume any statistical model of the packet drop events and can be implemented as a small modification of an existing LQG control design",

        "abstract": "Path-constrained optimal trajectory planning for serial-link robot arms has been extensively studied in the past decades. As an interesting topic in the robot motion planning and control, the kinematic singularity problem also attracted much attention in the literatures. In this paper, we present a systematic approach to plan an optimal trajectory passing though kinematic singularities with the end-effector precisely tracking the desired path. The method follows two steps. In the first step, the desired path is parameterized with a geometric variable q0. The robot motion can then be represented as a spatial curve in the joint space augmented by q0. The spatial curve, called augmented path, is obtained by numeric method as a function of another parameter s, which represents the arc-length of the augmented path. In the second step, the optimal trajectory with respect to time can be solved by optimally assigning s(t) along the augmented path. Dynamic programming is adopted in this paper to fulfill the optimal computation. Numerical simulations are carried out to verify the presented approach",

We derive then a numerical algorithm based on the discretization of the time law through an interpolation with non uniform cubic splines.

This solution is not now only shown to be (1) computationally optimal, but in addition, it is empirically shown that (2) it also produces the most consistent environment map. For a given environment size and sensor range, we can determine the optimal size of the local maps required to minimize the total computational cost and maximize map consistency.

        "abstract": "Path planned for tractor-trailer mobile robot (TTMR) does not seem to be easily adapted to the case when the number of the trailers increases, thus the repetitive path planning has to be introduced. For this problem, this paper investigates the connection relation of TTMR with variable structure, i.e. the number of the trailers is variable, and deals with the optimization design for it to avoid the repetitive path planning when the number of the trailers increases. After analyzing the motion trajectories of TTMR, we establish the quantitative relationship for the motion characteristics between the transient course and the steady state. Based on which, a new design method to optimize the connection relation for variable-structure TTMR is proposed. In our scheme, the length of each connecting rod between two adjacent bodies is adjusted properly such that the transient deviations of the trailers from the path followed by the tractor will be less than the steady ones. In such a way, the path planned for TTMR can also be appropriate for the case when the number of the trailers varies. The simulations and experiments show the validity of our method",

The algorithm has constant time complexity in the state estimation and is capable to run real-time. The main contribution resides in the idea of reducing the complexity by means of an assumption on the environment. This is done by mapping only lines that are parallel or perpendicular to each other which represent the main structure of most indoor environments. The combination of this assumption with a Kalman filter and a relative map approach is able to map our laboratory hallway with the size of 80 m times 50 m and a trajectory of more than 500 m. The precision of the resulting map is similar to the measurements done by hand which are used as the ground-truth",

A polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) film is selected as the sensing element because it is flexible, highly sensitive and easy to be integrated in different shapes. Thin and narrow PVDF strips are embedded with an innovative molding-embedding-remolding fabrication procedure in a segmented compliant silicone shell which serves as skin and passive actuation of a crawling earthworm-like mini-robot with the ability to elongate and contract. Several experiments were performed by using a purposely developed test-bench in order to test sensor behaviour. The results show that the biomimetic flexible PVDF-based sensor can detect both the external contact and the internal actions, thus imitating the exteroceptive and proprioceptive sensing capabilities of real earthworms. The developed biomimetic sensors are promising in order to achieve an useful sensor feedback for the earthworm-like minirobot motion control",

The purpose of the work presented in this paper is to improve performance of classical ICP. We address, here, the problem of pair-wise registration of color range images. Many variants of ICP have been proposed for the registration of 3D data sets. However, there are only a few solutions dealing with color range images. In this paper, we have adapted some variants of ICP to take into account color information in the closest point research. Two approaches of color data integration have been evaluated with real 3D/color data sets",

        "abstract": "This paper describes a panoramic view-based navigation in outdoor environments. We have been developing a two-phase navigation method. In the training phase, the robot acquires image sequences along the desired route and automatically learns the route visually. In the subsequent autonomous navigation phase, the robot moves by localizing itself by comparing input images with the learned route representation. To be robust to changes of weather and seasons, an object-based comparison is adopted. Our previous method applied a support vector machine (SVM) algorithm to object recognition and localization and exhibited a satisfactory performance but was sometimes sensitive to the variation of the robot's heading. This paper thus extends the method to use panoramic images. By searching the image for the region which matches the model image the most, a new method can considerably improve the localization performance and provide the robot with globally correct directions to move",

Impact postures are regulated by two parameters and middle postures are selected to adapt the swing foot to negotiate obstacles. To evaluate constraint conditions, stability margins, and walking performances, some indices are defined, and the correlations between these indices and the two parameters are illustrated by the corresponding atlases. The optimum design method which considers multi-criteria is carried out by using these atlases. This method provides not only one optimum result, but also an optimum region which contains all feasible optimum results. Using these atlases presented in this paper one can obtain the optimum result with respect to any object(s)",

The task-space forces are treated in a uniform manner for a variety of position/force tracking and force/moment compensation. The contact force closure is optimally solved and transformed directly into the joint torques in real-time without any joint trajectory planning. With this framework, we introduce gravity compensation at the lowest layer of the controller that makes the closed-loop system passive with respect to additional inputs as well as external forces. Furthermore, we propose two upper-layers: one layer controls the ground reaction forces, which enables the robot keep the dynamic balance. The other layer is the another passification control, which constructs an invariant manifold that prevents the robot from falling during walking. Four realistic dynamic simulations: balanced squatting, reaching, externally driven, or speed-controlled walking with disturbances demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed methods.",

In the past many algorithms were proposed based on a weighted pseudoinverse of the grasp map combined with an internal force control. The majority of these algorithms require robust contact detection/tracking and switching controllers. Employing the virtual object introduced by Stramigioli we present an object-level control law. We define a novel virtual object frame based on the robot hand configuration. Our control law takes a desired object frame and desired grasping forces as input, it is passive, has an intuitive physical meaning, and stability is even given in case a finger looses contact with the object. A damping design as a function of the desired object stiffness and the combined hand-object inertia is presented. The performance of the controller is proven in two experiments implemented on the DLR Hand II",

It is determined that the slip motion of each wheel of the rover must be increased and cannot be neglected when the rover travels on loose soil. Because of slip, following an arbitrary path on loose soil is a difficult task. In order to improve this situation, the authors have developed a path following algorithm with slip compensation. In this algorithm, both steering and driving maneuvers of the rover are derived not only to follow an arbitrary path, but also simultaneously compensate for the slip. The performance of the path following strategy is confirmed through numerical simulation using the wheel-and-vehicle model elaborated in our previous research. The slip motion of the wheel is also addressed, based on a terramechanics approach. The proposed path following algorithm shows better performance than traditional control without slip compensation in the simulation",

        "abstract": "Manipulator robots working in changing environments need special path planners that provide good solutions in short times. In this work we describe a sample-based path planning algorithm that is suitable for such environments. Our approach is based on two points. Firstly, unlike most sampling techniques, we have defined a non-random local sampling which reduces the computational time greatly. Secondly, a set of interpolated walks is obtained through cubic splines which guarantee the smoothness and continuity of the walks. This path planning algorithm is part of a full intelligent manipulation system based on 3D vision",

In the first step the safest areas in the environment are extracted by means of a Voronoi diagram. In the second step fast marching method is applied to the Voronoi extracted areas in order to obtain the shortest path. In this way the trajectory obtained is the shortest between the safe possible ones. This two step method combines an extremely fast global planner operating on a simple sensor based environment modeling, while it operates at the sensor frequency. The main characteristics are speed and reliability, because the map dimensions are reduced to a unidimensional map and this map represents the safest areas in the environment for moving the robot",

For this, a method to track multiple walking humans using a mobile robot \"in motion\" with laser range finder (LRF) is investigated in this paper. Geometric characteristics of human legs are considered to detect their position from the LRF data. Frequency and phase of walking motion are extracted using a pendulum model of the angle between two legs and extended Kalman filter. The algorithm with human walking model anticipates the position of moving humans. The effectiveness of the proposed method is also evaluated with some experiments to track multiple walking humans in indoor environment. An experimental testbed which consists of a mobile robot \"Yamabico\" and a LRF is employed to track people. Resultant experiments and analysis showed that multiple walking people are tracked well from a mobile robot with the proposed method",

The Gabor wavelet feature is the most widely used image feature in face recognition systems because its recognition rate is superior to that of Eigenface systems. However, it remains unclear as to whether Gabor wavelet features are indeed the best wavelet features for face recognition. In this paper, we extract image features of facial images from various wavelet transforms (e.g., Haar, French hat, Mexican hat, Daubechies, Coiflet, Symlet, and O-spline) and evaluate their face recognition performance. We also compare the recognition performance of fixed- and adaptive-scale wavelet features. The results demonstrate that the performance of the wavelets assessed here is similar to that of the Gabor wavelet, and that the performance of adaptive-scale wavelet features is superior to that of fixed-scale features",

Similar to the contour error proposed for machine tools, the defined synchronization error represents the degree of coordination amongst the active joints in the parallel robot, which is substantially different from the traditional tracking errors. By using the synchronization error, all active joints in the parallel robot are controlled to move in a synchronous manner so that the trajectory tracking accuracy of the robot end-effector is substantially improved. In addition, with the use of adaptive control, the synchronization error and the pose error of the platform are guaranteed to converge to zero simultaneously, while uncertain parameters in the system dynamic model are guaranteed to converge to their true values. Experiments conducted on the planar parallel robot verify the above claims and evaluate performance of the proposed control approach, compared with conventional PID control",

        "abstract": "We have developed the person following robot \"ApriAttenda(TM)\". This robot can accompany a person using vision based target detection and avoid obstacles with ultrasonic sensors. The robot first identifies an individual with its image processing system by detecting a person's region and recognizing the registered color and texture of his/her clothes. Our newly developed algorithm allows the robot to extract a particular individual from a cluttered background, and to find and reconnect with the person if it loses visual contact. Tracking people with vision was realized by systematizing visual and motion control with a robust algorithm that utilizes various characteristics of the image data. ApriAttenda(TM) has been exhibited at Aichi EXPO 2005, and its robust functions and smooth person following capability were successfully demonstrated.",

        "abstract": "To deal with the problem of tracking person with a mobile robot in dynamic scene with occlusion, a tracking system is presented in this paper. We focus on the individual person tracking system, which is applied on our two-wheel mobile robot with a single PTZ (pan-tilt-zoom) camera. The tracking system works reliably in the dynamic environment with partial/complete occlusion. For the sake of complete occlusion, we use several filters and spatial relation restriction to represent the target model. These filters are all based on the appearance of the target, and each filter models a part of human body which is more rigid than the entire body. To construct a tracking system, the situation-based strategy and a simple frame-to-frame tracker are involved in the system, and an improved mean-shift tracking algorithm is applied as the tracker in this paper. Finally, experimental results on tracking individual person with complete occlusion in different environments are shown, which demonstrate the robustness and effectiveness of the algorithm",

        "abstract": "We propose a new tactile sensor utilizing piezoelectric vibration. This tactile sensor has a high sensitivity, wide measurement range, pressure resistance, flexibility, and self-sensing function. This tactile sensor comprises two piezoelectric materials. One is used for the vibration of the sensor element and the other is used for the measurement of the change in mechanical impedance induced by an external force. We achieved the wide measurement range by implementing two ideas. One was to apply the external force to the sensor element through an elastic body and the other was to use two or more modes of vibration. Moreover, for the elastic body, it is preferable to use a material whose elasticity and viscosity are easily changed by an external force, such as a gel. In this study, first, this tactile sensor was analyzed, and then its characteristics were derived. The analytical results qualitatively corresponded to the experimental results. Next, a prototype tactile sensor was fabricated and evaluated. The evaluation results showed that this tactile sensor can measure a pressure of 2.5 Pa or less and a pressure of 10 kPa or more and its pressure resistance is 1 MPa or more",

        "abstract": "An important problem in robotics is planning and selecting actions for goal-directed behavior in noisy uncertain environments. The problem is typically addressed within the framework of partially observable Markov decision processes (POMDPs). Although efficient algorithms exist for learning policies for MDPs, these algorithms do not generalize easily to POMDPs. In this paper, we propose a framework for planning and action selection based on probabilistic inference in graphical models. Unlike previous approaches based on MAP inference, our approach utilizes the most probable explanation (MPE) of variables in a graphical model, allowing tractable and efficient inference of actions. It generalizes easily to complex partially observable environments. Furthermore, it allows rewards and costs to be incorporated in a straightforward manner as part of the inference process. We investigate the application of our approach to the problem of robot navigation by testing it on a suite of well-known POMDP benchmarks. Our results demonstrate that the proposed method can beat or match the performance of recently proposed specialized POMDP solvers.",

This system realizes omni-directional motion on flat floor using special wheels and passes over non-flat ground in forward or backward direction using the passive suspension mechanism. In order to realize the high mobile performance during step climbing, it is required to reduce wheel slippage for maximizing wheel traction. This paper proposes a new plural wheel control method based on wheel slip estimation. Our key idea is estimation of wheel slippage comparing with the loads and rotation velocities of all actuated wheels, and using this result for wheel control of the vehicle for reducing wheel slippage. The controller can adjust control tractions of plural wheels when the wheel begins to slip and can improve the mobile performance of the vehicle. The performance of our proposed control scheme is experimented by computer simulations and experiments",

Policy gradient methods remain one of the few exceptions and have found a variety of applications. Nevertheless, the application of such methods is not without peril if done in an uninformed manner. In this paper, we give an overview on learning with policy gradient methods for robotics with a strong focus on recent advances in the field. We outline previous applications to robotics and show how the most recently developed methods can significantly improve learning performance.

        "abstract": "An algorithm for pose and motion estimation using corresponding features in omnidirectional images and a digital terrain map is proposed. In previous paper, such algorithm for regular camera was considered. Using a digital terrain (or digital elevation) map (DTM/DEM) as a global reference enables recovering the absolute position and orientation of the camera. In order to do this, the DTM is used to formulate a constraint between corresponding features in two consecutive frames. In this paper, these constraints are extended to handle non-central projection, as is the case with many omnidirectional systems. The utilization of omnidirectional data is shown to improve the robustness and accuracy of the navigation algorithm. The feasibility of this algorithm is established through lab experimentation with two kinds of omnidirectional acquisition systems. The first one is polydioptric cameras while the second is catadioptric camera",

We applied sliding mode control to the posture stability of a six-legged walking robot which is developed in our laboratory and named TRUTH, on the basis of designing a suspension model which has virtual springs and dampers in the vertical direction, the directions of the pitch angle and the roll angle, respectively. The proposed method is discussed using the walking experimental results of the developed six-legged walking robot",

        "abstract": "Piezoelectric actuators are advantageous for microrobots due to their light weight, high bandwidth, high force production, low power consumption, and simplicity of integration. However, the main disadvantage of either stack or cantilever piezoelectric actuators are the high drive voltages required for adequate force and displacement. This especially limits the ability for such actuators to be used in autonomous microrobots because of the weight and complexity of necessary power electronics. This paper approaches the design of all the component parts of an autonomous piezoelectric robot as a linear constraint on the weight and efficiency of those components. It then focuses on the choice and optimization of the power electronics section of the robot, specifically exploring three different high voltage generation methods. Finally, one of these power electronics designs is implemented and its behavior is experimentally explored",

Novel aspects of this system are the new force sensing approach, a parallel kinematic structure and the modified zero-force control scheme. In contrary to other force sensors the proposed approach only requires the position data delivered by a 6 d.o.f. position/orientation measurement system and properties of elastic objects. Because 6 d.o.f. position/orientation measurement systems are standard equipment in computer-aided surgery there is no need for additional sensors. The paper concludes with the experimental evaluation of the force control scheme and an accuracy analysis for the assisted milling",

The knowledge of target location is described as a probability distribution over the regions, and the searcher can only move from one region to another as the structure allows. The objective is to find a feasible path through the regions that maximizes the probability of locating the target within fixed time. This problem generalizes the existing optimal searcher path problem (OSP) by additionally stipulating a minimum amount of time that a finite-speed searcher must spend to travel through a region before reaching the next. We propose a technique to obtain the upper bound of detection for solving the problem in a branch and bound framework. Comparisons show that the technique is also superior to known bounding methods for the original optimal searcher path problem",

The RAN is used as a function approximator, and Q-learning is used to learn the control policy in 'off-policy' fashion that enables learning to be bootstrapped by a prior knowledge controller, thus speeding up the reinforcement learning. Our approach is verified on a PeopleBot robot executing a visual servoing based docking behavior in which the robot is required to reach a goal pose. Further experiments show that the RAN network can also be used for supervised learning prior to reinforcement learning in a layered architecture, thus further improving the performance of the docking behavior",

This interface will assist the designer to quantify and classify the comfort index of automobile interior design for quality control, as well as provide customers a sensory experience of surface textures so as to determine the desired surface characteristics for each individual customer. To realize this purpose, a high resolution optical tactile sensor for accurately capturing interior surface textures is developed. Based on the intensity information of the achieved 2-D tactile image, the contact area map and the 3-D shape of the surface texture is recovered. In addition, a high performance haptic electrotactile array device was fabricated for rendering the tactile sensation of surface texture in the fingertip of the designer/customer. Calibration and experimental results verified the high performance of the developed tactile haptic interface. This interface can be further developed to be an effective and efficient knowledge based evaluation system for improving automobile interior design",

        "abstract": "This work describes a semi-autonomous robot for rescue operations, nicknamed RAPOSA (FOX in English). The robot was designed and built to operate in outdoor environments hostile to the human presence, such as debris resulting from the collapse of built structures, and is targeted to the tele-operated detection of potential survivors using a set of specific sensors whose information is transmitted to a remote human operator. RAPOSA's mechanical structure is composed of a main body and a front body, whose locomotion is supported on tracked wheels, allowing motion even when the robot is upside down. The front body has variable tilting capabilities, providing means to overcome edges higher than the robot main body (e.g., when climbing a stair) and is also useful to grab the lower ground when only the main body has ground contact. This front body has one thermal camera and two web cameras installed. Additional sensors include gas, temperature and humidity sensors, Web cams, light diodes, microphone and loudspeaker. The robot uses wireless communications, with an option for tethered operation. The tether carries both power and communications, with an access point on its end, and can also be used to suspend the robot inside a deep hole. Docking and undocking the robot to the tether is accomplished remotely by the operator with the help of a camera located inside the robot, and represents the most innovative feature of RAPOSA",

        "abstract": "Robot search and rescue is a time critical task, i.e. a large terrain has to be explored by multiple robots within a short amount of time. The efficiency of exploration depends mainly on the coordination between the robots and hence on the reliability of communication, which considerably suffers under the hostile conditions encountered after a disaster. Furthermore, rescue robots have to generate a map of the environment which has to be sufficiently accurate for reporting the locations of victims to human task forces. Basically, the robots have to solve autonomously in real-time the problem of simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM). This paper proposes a novel method for real-time exploration and SLAM based on RFID tags that are autonomously distributed in the environment. We utilized the algorithm of Lu and Milios for calculating globally consistent maps from detected RFID tags. Furthermore we show how RFID tags can be used for coordinating the exploration of multiple robots. Results from experiments conducted in the simulation and on a robot show that our approach allows the computationally efficient construction of a map within harsh environments, and coordinated exploration of a team of robots",

Therefore, the system elements from multi-disciplinary areas can be integrated and reconfigured easily in such a system. Also the system modules can be ported flexibly. In this paper, a Rt-Linux based open robot controller (RTOC) is investigated. A reference model for robot controlling is proposed, in which hardware platform, operating system module and application modules are included. Then for the implementation of RTOC, two critical implementation problems - layered architecture and the intra-layer interfaces are discussed on the base of its reference model. The RTOC openness is also analyzed. Consequently, the proposed RTOC is applied to an industrial arc welding robot",

        "abstract": "A fundamental property of rough-terrain motion planning is that each configuration of the robot on the terrain can be assigned a characteristic navigational difficulty based on the terrain topography and physical properties of the underground. This measure is computed in an application-dependent manner based on the properties of the robot and terrain model employed. In this work we propose a motion planner based on rapidly exploring random trees (RRTs) which takes into consideration the characteristics of the underground. In the suggested solution, the randomised expansion of the RRTs is biased towards regions of low navigational difficulty. The motion planner generates trajectories which follow areas of easy navigation and only deviates to harder regions where inevitable. In particular, the maximal difficulty on the path is approximately minimised. For single-query motion planning tasks, bidirectional RRTs have proven to be effective in rapidly computing a path between the initial and goal configurations. To deal with complex distributions of the terrain characteristics, this concept has been extended. Rooted at randomly chosen configurations, a number of additional RRTs is grown. While the algorithm discussed is intended for rough-terrain motion planning and demonstrated in this context, it can easily be adapted to other domains where a characteristic measure for the desirability of attaining individual configurations can be defined",

A comprehensive description of the modelling aspects is presented. Outdoor range only tracking results using the newly derived model are fully described with a comparison to the free space model commonly used for radio frequency applications. Although this approach is applicable for generic localisation purposes in indoor and outdoor environments, it is of fundamental importance when applied to proximity detection involving large machines. In particular in environments such as mining, stevedoring and construction there is a need to detect the presence of personnel in close proximity to machines. A close proximity system that makes use of the newly derived model is presented working with a 100 tons mining haul truck",

Since it would be very difficult or impractical to use conventional analytical method to analyze and obtain the workspace of a humanoid robot, we present a numerical approach in this paper using the Monte Carlo method. As a random sampling numerical method, the Monte Carlo method is relatively simple and flexible to apply, and hence is suitable for the workspace generation of a humanoid robot. After formulating the basic constraints that a humanoid robot must satisfy in a manipulation task to enable the Monte Carlo method in generation of the reachable space, we present the algorithm and a method to build a database for utilization of the numerical results in application. We illustrate this method by an example conducted on the humanoid platform HRP-2. The results show that this method is feasible and practical for the generation and visualization of workspace of a humanoid robot",

Motivated by physiological studies related to first task, reaching to grasp, and a simple control method composed of joint-damping and a single virtual spring, we try out for realization of continuous reaching-to-preshaping movements by robotic hand-arm systems with a pair of 2DOFs fingers and a 3DOFs arm. Differently from conventional researches, this paper treats neither trajectories planning nor inverse kinematics. Instead of those, a few transit point and desired point in task-space and a control method with Jacobian transpose and joint velocity damping are merely adopted. Based on results of numerical computer simulation, it is concluded that it is possible to simply realize continuous robotic reaching-to-preshaping motion by adopting the transit points and the control method",

One manipulator arm is controlled to fulfil a user defined task. The second arm is then controlled to compensate for the disturbances on the cable-suspended platform arising from the motion of the first. Model-based feedforward control, stemming from the momentum conservation equations of a free-floating robot, is developed for the motion compensation problem. Furthermore, due to model uncertainty, sensor-based feedback control is introduced, to account for undesired oscillatory motions of the system. The latter control problem reduces to the dissipation of the oscillatory energy of the system, by means of adequate robot control. Both control methods are implemented and tested on an experimental set-up",

This paper describes research into the detection and segmentation of reflectionally symmetric objects in digital images, without the use of a priori object models. The detection method does not assume uniform object colour or texture, and does not rely on prebuilt models such as 3D geometric primitives. A novel detection algorithm has been developed to find lines of reflectional symmetry in images. This detection algorithm can operate at 10 frames per second on 640 by 480 pixel images. Using the detected symmetry, objects are segmented with a dynamic programming approach. Both algorithms have been extended to accommodate skew symmetry",

        "abstract": "Many objects found in domestic environments are reflectionally symmetric. In this paper, we present a system that can visually track moving objects by their reflectional symmetry in real time. Apart from the assumption of symmetry, the tracking system does not require any prior object models of the target, such as its colour and shape. The system is robust to shadows and specular reflections. It can also deal with transparent objects. Block motion detection is used in conjunction with symmetry for object tracking. A Kalman filter is used to estimate the object state. Predictions from the Kalman filter is used to improve the efficiency of the symmetry detector. The tracker provides a real time segmentation of an object by searching for motion that is symmetric about the object's mirror line. The tracking system also generates a rotated bounding box, aligned with the object's symmetry line, which can be used as a window for other image processing operations. The final system can track single objects in 640times480 videos at over 40 frames per second using a standard notebook PC",

The process of control vectors generation is described, and a detailed mathematical modeling of the aircraft dynamics is presented. We have also proposed a control strategy for full stabilization of the tri-rotor aircraft considering some real constraints specific to small UAVs. The synthesized controller is simple and results in good performance as demonstrated in simulations and in real-time experiments.

        "abstract": "This paper presents a robot audition system that recognizes simultaneous speech in the real world by using robot-embedded microphones. We have previously reported missing feature theory (MFT) based integration of sound source separation (SSS) and automatic speech recognition (ASR) for building robust robot audition. We demonstrated that a MFT-based prototype system drastically improved the performance of speech recognition even when three speakers talked to a robot simultaneously. However, the prototype system had three problems; being offline, hand-tuning of system parameters, and failure in voice activity detection (VAD). To attain online processing, we introduced FlowDesigner-based architecture to integrate sound source localization (SSL), SSS and ASR. This architecture brings fast processing and easy implementation because it provides a simple framework of shared-object-based integration. To optimize the parameters, we developed genetic algorithm (GA) based parameter optimization, because it is difficult to build an analytical optimization model for mutually dependent system parameters. To improve VAD, we integrated new VAD based on a power spectrum and location of a sound source into the system, since conventional VAD relying only on power often fails due to low signal-to-noise ratio of simultaneous speech. We, then, constructed a robot audition system for Honda ASIMO. As a result, we showed that the system worked online and fast, and had a better performance in robustness and accuracy through experiments on recognition of simultaneous speech in a noisy and echoic environment",

The objective is to apply it to a mobile robot navigation system. To achieve that, the goal is to solve the simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) problem. Our approach consists in the 3D sequential mapping of natural landmarks by means of a stereo camera, which also provides means to obtain the camera location/orientation. The dynamic behavior is modeled using a top-down Bayesian method. The results show a comparison between our system and a monocular visual SLAM system using a hand-waved camera. Several improvements related to no priori environment knowledge requirements, lower processing time (real-time constrained) and higher robustness is presented",

This paper addresses real-time sound source tracking by real-time integration of an in-room microphone array (IRMA) and a robot-embedded microphone array (REMA). The IRMA system consists of 64 ch microphones attached to the walls. It localizes multiple sound sources based on weighted delay-and-sum beam-forming on a 2D plane. The REMA system localizes multiple sound sources in azimuth using eight microphones attached to a robot's head on a rotational table. The localization results are integrated to track multiple sound sources by using a particle filter in real-time. The experimental results show that particle filter based integration improved accuracy and robustness in multiple sound source tracking even when the robot's head was in rotation",

        "abstract": "A novel solution to the three-dimensional dynamic human-robot collision problem is presented. Sphere-based geometric models are used for the human and robot due to the efficiency of the distance computation. The collision avoidance algorithm searches for collision-free paths by moving the end-effector along a set of pre-defined search directions. An optimization method is employed to select the search direction that balances between the robot approaching its goal location, and maximizing the distances between the human and robot models. The optimization incorporates predictions of the motions of the robot and human to reduce the negative effects of a non-instantaneous robot time response. The robot prediction is based on a transfer function model of its experimental time response at the joint level. The human prediction is performed at the sphere level using the weighted mean of past velocities. Predicting at the sphere level eliminates the difficulty introduced by the limbs moving in different directions. After describing the collision avoidance algorithm, a human walking towards a moving Puma robot arm is simulated. Captured motion data is used to make the human motion realistic. Monte Carlo simulations using 1000 random human walking paths passing through the robot workspace are used to evaluate the algorithm. The algorithm prevented all collisions due to the robot. The algorithm is deterministic and efficient enough to be used in real-time. On a 1.8 GHz Pentium IV PC, a 40 Hz sampling rate was achieved",

        "abstract": "Humanoid robotics and SLAM (simultaneous localisation and mapping) are certainly two of the most significant themes of the current worldwide robotics research effort, but the two fields have up until now largely run independent parallel paths, despite the obvious benefit to be gained in joining the two. The next major step forward in humanoid robotics will be increased autonomy, and the ability of a robot to create its own world map on the fly will be a significant enabling technology. Meanwhile, SLAM techniques have found most success with robot platforms and sensor configurations which are outside of the humanoid domain. Humanoid robots move with high linear and angular accelerations in full 3D, and normally only vision is available as an outward-looking sensor. Building on recently published work on monocular SLAM using vision, and on pattern generation, we show that real-time SLAM for a humanoid can indeed be achieved. Using HRP-2, we present results in which a sparse 3D map of visual landmarks is acquired on the fly using a single camera and demonstrated loop closing and drift-free 3D motion estimation within a typical cluttered indoor environment. This is achieved by tightly coupling the pattern generator, the robot odometry and inertial sensing to aid visual mapping within a standard EKF framework. To our knowledge this is the first implementation of real-time 3D SLAM for a humanoid robot able to demonstrate loop closing",

Paths and trajectories are planned simultaneously as the robot moves and globally subject to some optimization criteria based on evolutionary computation. The robot always follows the current best trajectory with respect to predictions of obstacle motions through sensing. At any time the robot may switch seamlessly to a better trajectory as the planner continues to improve or adapt trajectories to the changing environment. To minimize energy and time, the planned arm and base trajectories are loosely-coupled so that the arm may stop its motion (relative to base) for some period while the base moves, or vice versa, in handling obstacles.",

Because several types of tactile sensation consist in touch and human tactile feeling has high time resolution. A man feels active touch extraordinary with time delayed transmission of tactile information. Our proposing human finger mimetic sensor covers three tactile factors, which are roughness, softness and friction of objects to touch. Current tactile telepresence systems represent just one tactile sensation in addition to kinesthetic information. For augmented reality, wider tactile factors must be sensed at a tactile sensor system and transferred to a tactile display system with small time delay. We realized quick estimation of vibrational frequencies of the sensor and softness of objects to regenerate touch feelings to human skin by tactile displays, which usually need time-consuming samples and make it hard to address tactile telepresence system. Quick estimation of vibrational frequency was conducted by emulating impulse emission of Meissner's corpuscles. Quick estimation of Young's modulus of objects was solved by computing strain distribution in a sensor",

        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "A method for real-time collision avoidance for underactuated autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) in the sea environment with unknown obstacle configurations and unknown vortex sea flow is proposed. The proposed method is an application of the Markov-decision-process- (MDP) based motion planning method. It is essential to adopt the MDP-based method for managing both the kinematics and dynamics of an AUV affected by sea flow. The real-time obstacle avoidance needs replanning when a new obstacle is discovered so that the AUV can find a suitable path around concave obstacles; however, MDP-based re-planning calculations require high computational power and are hard to be used in real time. In addition, it is impossible to know the whole distribution of the changing sea flow velocity in real time. Therefore, MDP-based re-planning calculation during the mission is not efficient. As a solution, the proposed method combines a rough re-planning considering only the geometrical properties of obstacles with rough target path tracking considering the kinematical and dynamical property of the AUV. Because there is no guarantee that the AUV can track the target path with high accuracy, the AUV is controlled to avoid collisions with obstacles at the same time. The rough target path tracking and obstacle avoidance is done using the result of off-line MDP based motion planning. The performance of the proposed method is examined by simulation of an AUV cruising in a vortex sea flow",

The method consists of an efficient and robust solution for detecting multiple planar regions in a global optimal sense. Moreover, in contrast with existing techniques which also work on intensity images, neither assumptions about the scene are made nor heuristic hypotheses are formulated. More specifically, the proposed method is based on a systematic, progressive voting procedure from the solution of a linear system, which exploits the two-view geometry. Hence, besides avoiding intermediary depth maps, the progressive mechanism together with such a convergence mapping drastically reduce the computational and storage complexities of the approach. Results from both synthetic and real-world scenes in different scenarios and under various kinds of strong noise confirm its effectiveness and robustness against large camera calibration errors and to the presence of outliers",

A largely unsolved problem is how to detect multiple contacts that are formed simultaneously between non-convex and non-polyhedral general objects both accurately and in real-time. This paper presents an effective solution to the problem. Our approach first locates the pairs of closest components by fast intersection checking based on hybrid bounding volume hierarchies of surface components. For each pair of such components, it then finds the pairs of closest points and corresponding pairs of closest parametric features by combining collision detection or minimum distance query between polygonal meshes of those components and exact distance computation between the parametric features.

        "abstract": "In this paper, we propose a real-time method to detect obstacles using theoretical models of the ground plane, first in a 3D point cloud given by a stereo camera, and then in an optical flow field given by one of the stereo pair's camera. The idea of our method is to combine two partial occupancy grids from both sensor modalities with an occupancy grid framework. The two methods do not have the same range, precision and resolution. For example, the stereo method is precise for close objects but cannot see further than 7 m (with our lenses), while the optical flow method can see considerably further but has lower accuracy. Experiments that have been carried on the CyCab mobile robot and on a tractor demonstrate that we can combine the advantages of both algorithms to build local occupancy grids from incomplete data (optical flow from a monocular camera cannot give depth information without time integration)",

By providing a Bayesian solution for the density estimation problem, the algorithm needs significantly less training data than conventional techniques and is applicable to different environments. The algorithm is based on colour and wavelet convolution of image patches to model the information contained in natural features. Dimensionality reduction techniques are applied to map data points to a lower dimensional space where Bayesian density estimation is computed. Experiments were performed in underwater, aerial and terrestrial domains demonstrating the accuracy and generalisation properties of the algorithm for recognition and segmentation. Comparisons with conventional density estimation techniques are provided to illustrate the benefits of the new approach",

In this method the homogenous solution of differential kinematics is derived as a weighted sum of joint velocities lying in the null space of the manipulator Jacobian instead of establishing an overall objective function as a weighted sum of multiple criteria. It remarkably increases flexibility in adding new secondary performance criteria since it does not require to recalculate the gradient of new overall objective function. A systematic design of variable weights is introduced to actively reflect the instant states of each criterion in real-time. Experimental results with a 7-DOF redundant robot illustrate the validity of the proposed scheme",

It is based on the linearity of the transformation from binocular visual space to joint space of the arm of the humanoid robot which has a similar kinetic structure as a human being. LVS is very robust to calibration errors, especially to camera angle errors, because it uses constant Jacobian matrix with neither camera angles nor joint angles to calculate feedback command. Furthermore, the amount of calculation is very small compared to conventional visual servoing schemes. Hence, it is especially suitable for humanoid robots which use active stereo vision. But conventional LVS can not deal with redundant arm, because it is based on linear approximation of inverse kinematics. In this paper, we propose a redundant arm positioning control method by linear visual servoing based on linear approximation of forward kinematics.

        "track": "main",
        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "Point cloud registration and sensor calibration are two critical technical issues concerning robot-mounted, area sensor systems. Iterative closest point (ICP)-based algorithms developed in the past are commonly used for point cloud registration. However, due to its least squared fitting nature, registration quality depends on how closely the measured part matches its nominal definition, typical in the form of a CAD model in modern times. To eliminate the dependency of registration quality on part closeness to the CAD model, we present, in this paper, a more robust approach based in a series of coordinate transformations. Geometric features and surface gradients are accounted for to improve the registration performance. To achieve robot/sensor hand-eye calibration, an ICP-based method is used. The reason is that this calibration step typically utilizes standard parts or gauges machined for the purpose of calibration, as such they are known shapes that match their CAD models with much tighter tolerances. This offers us an unique opportunity to apply an ICPbased tool to find the transformation matrix from the robot end effector to an area sensor mounted onto it. The discussed method was successfully implemented and tested in a feedback-based, robot-mounted area sensor system developed for manufacturing quality control of 3D freeform surfaces",

        "abstract": "Robots for high-force interaction with humans face particular challenges to achieve performance and coupled stability. Because available actuators are unable to provide sufficiently high force density and low impedance, controllers for such machines often attempt to mask the robots physical dynamics, though this threatens stability. Controlling for passivity, the state-of-the-art means of ensuring coupled stability, inherently limits performance to levels that are often unacceptable. A controller that imposes passivity is compared to a controller designed by a new method that uses limited knowledge of human dynamics to improve performance. Both controllers were implemented on a testbed, and coupled stability and performance were tested. Results show that the new controller can improve both stability and performance. The different structures of the controllers yield key differences in physical behavior, and guidelines are provided to assist in choosing the appropriate approach for specific applications",

        "abstract": "In this investigation a robotic system's dynamic performance is optimized for high reliability under uncertainty. The dynamic capability equations (DCE) allow designers to predict the dynamic performance of a robotic system for a particular configuration and reference point on the end-effector (i.e.,point design). Here the DCE are used in conjunction with a reliability-based design optimization (RBDO) strategy in order to obtain designs with robust dynamic performance with respect to the end-effector reference point. In this work a unilevel performance measure approach (PMA) is used to perform RBDO. This is important for the reliable design of robotic systems in which a solution to the DCE is required for each constraint call. The method is illustrated on a robot design problem",

        "abstract": "Non-industrial robot applications are getting more popular than ever. Moving capability is one of the most important features of non-industrial robots. In general, the movements of non-industrial robots are categorized as wheeled and legged mechanical platforms. The wheeled platform performs stable and fast movement characteristics; however, it can not move on humpy grounds or cross small doorsills. Contrarily, the legged platform performs better adaptations to different types of ground conditions; nevertheless, the walking velocity and stability and the larger energy consumptions restrict the practical applications. In this paper, we present a hybrid-structure robot with humanoid and vehicle types to perform home security tasks. To achieve home security issues, the smoke and temperature detection sensors are mounted on the robot. At the same time, the CCD camera is mounted on the head of a robot to capture the guarded videos and to assist remote manipulations. The security robot is controlled remotely in terms of wireless manner. The proposed hybrid-structure robot behaves vehicle type in most of operation time to perform stable and fast movements and to reduce energy consumptions. When the robot enters humpy grounds or crosses small doorsills, the robot structure is changed as humanoid type to pass the non-flat grounds. Therefore, the proposed hybrid-structure security robot provides flexible adaptations to different types of ground conditions in home. Due to size limitations, the security robot can be used in regular apartments. Finally, a 50 cm in height security robot prototype is implemented in laboratory. The robot had been successfully tested for legged walking, wheeled driving, changing structures, cross small doorsills, remote manipulations, and remote monitoring of security functions",

This teleoperated system is based on simple mutual human-robot cooperation where the person remotely communicates with the mobile robot. We define the specific task of buying FRESH foods in a supermarket from a remote location. In order to do shopping operations, the robot has to be able of grasping a large amount of objects with different textures, shapes and weights which include fruits and vegetables with soft and irregular forms. After the user chooses the product to buy, the process is the next, firstly the robot has to find the object, then grasp it and then place it into a shopping basket. In this work, we built a system according to the previously explained requirements which involves autonomous navigation, environment perception, object manipulation and teleoperation. In this paper, we present the developed suction hand for picking fresh foods and evaluate its operating performance through experimental results",

        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "This paper deals with the haptic rendering of collisions between a human operator and rigid objects in a virtual environment. The focus being on high-velocity impacts on a rigid wall. After discussing the importance of velocity measurements in contrast to force measurements, a new haptic device is introduced. The new device is capable of applying directly an 'impulse' to the operator, similar to collisions occurring in the real world. Based on a Poisson-model of the rigid virtual object, the necessary change of momentum of the operator's hand is being estimated online. A momentum wheel, under velocity-control, is engaged through an electromagnetic toothed clutch, at the estimated instant of impact. The resulting immediate change in momentum is thought to be essential for giving interactions with rigid virtual objects a realistic feel. Rather than generating so-called 'impulsive forces' with big motors, this approach relies only on small motors and is thus intrinsically safer. Experiments are performed on a one-degree of freedom setup. Conclusions are drawn and future directions of this research are sketched",

With the development of research on wireless sensor networks (WSNs), localization in the WSNs has become a very important research point. At present, there are mainly two kinds of approaches, range-based approach and range-free approach. Localization precision of range-based approach is higher than the range-free approach. In the range-based approach, time difference of arrival (TDOA) method needs less requirements for time synchronization. This paper proposes a self-localization approach based on TDOA, which utilizes average value of time difference by rolling average to decrease the measurement error, and adopts unconstrained least squares (LS) estimator to achieve the accurate localization. Simulation results and error analysis prove its validity",

In order to independently accomplish complex missions in unstructured and unknown oceanic environment, intelligent control system is needed to provide the underwater glider with the ability of active autonomy. Based on the RW (Ramadge & Wonham) supervisory control theory of discrete event dynamic system (DEDS), a three-level hierarchical supervisory control architecture for underwater glider is presented. The DEDS formalism models of underwater glider in terms of finite state automata (FSA) are built, and the realization of the hierarchical supervisory control (HSC) system is brought forth in detail. The simulation result shows that the three-level supervisory control system can adapt to uncertain undersea environment, and makes reasonable planning",

        "abstract": "The walking modes shifting of a gorilla robot is a kind of movements between biped standing state and quadruped landing state. In this paper, the robot mechanism is reduced to a 3-D.O.F inverted pendulum model with variable pendulum length, and the variable ZMP is defined reasonably as a function related to the inverted pendulum angle. Base on dynamic balance theory, the trajectory equation of robot's mass centre during the walking mode shifting is deduced. Furthermore, through inverse kinematics analysis for robot's mass center, the trajectories of joint are obtained. Thus method of trajectory generation about walking mode shifting for humanoid and gorilla robot is proposed. In order to verify the correctness of the method, a calculation example of trajectory generation is provided, and the continuing action simulation including biped walking and quadruped landing action, quadruped walking and standing up action is successfully realized. On the basis of above work, the continuing action experiment including biped walking and walking modes transitions for a humanoid and gorilla robot \"GoRoBoT\" developed by us is also finished",

Due to rapid point-to-point movements, SCARA robot arms exhibit large vibrations after reaching the destination position. A mathematical model particularly suitable for residual vibration analysis is developed. The root cause of residual vibrations is analyzed using the model. Based on the root cause analysis, a practical solution to suppress vibrations is proposed. The solution utilizes an acceleration smoother to smooth the commanded trajectory, and it can be easily implemented in practice without redesign the robot hardware or control system. Experimental results show over 40% reduction in both vibration amplitude and settling time.",

This paper proposes a resource management system with RFID technology, which can access to the real-time position and operation process information of material handling equipments, as well as some load item information. This warehouse management system is designed to select the most suitable resource usage package for handling warehouse operation orders. An experiment warehouse is built in the Institute of Automation, Chinese Academy of Sciences to validate the effectiveness of the warehouse management system. The results show increase in rack space utilization and loading speed as well as decrease in work-related errors and operation costs in comparison with a similar system without RFID technology",

However, in some states, the applied knowledge fails to achieve a given task. In our method, the failing states are found by using the decrease in the state values, and the policy for these states is then modified. In order to demonstrate the validity of our method, we applied it to rearrangement tasks of multiple objects. The appropriate policies were obtained by integrating programs for similar tasks and a simple rule for the task process; moreover, a new knowledge that is effective in the rearrangement tasks was extracted from the obtained policies",

Guided by corpus analysis and earlier work on coarse qualitative route descriptions, we decompose instructions given by humans into sequences of imprecise route segment descriptions. By applying fuzzy rules for the involved spatial relations and actions, we construct a search tree that can be searched in a depth-first branch-and-bound manner for the most probable goal configuration w.r.t. the global workspace knowledge of the robot. The applicability of our approach is shown by a real-world experiment where an operator instructs his automated wheelchair to navigate in an office-like environment",

        "abstract": "Sensors such as cameras and range finders provide flexibility and safety to telerobotic manipulations. However, in order to use their supportive features, sensor-based telerobotic control requires that both the sensors and the robot arm be calibrated so that the manipulator can target and articulate objects in the environment easily and effectively. The scope of this paper is to define the sensor-manipulator calibration issue, outline the system errors, describe the calibration methods, and explain the algorithms necessary to provide compensation. The problem was divided into three steps: acquisition of calibration data of the sensor and the arm, numerical analysis and determination of needed parameters, and validation of obtained results. Since the task is to find parameters that represent the object position accurately, the problem is treated as multidimensional least squares optimization problem with simple bounds. The function to minimize is the distance between the target and its calculated position. Two approaches are applied to represent kinematics parameters: Euler angles and quaternions. Solutions are analyzed to determine the best method for future planned online calibration checks as well as to perform teleoperation tasks on the calibrated system",

        "abstract": "This paper presents a method for robot and landmarks 2D localization, in man made environments, taking profit of scene planes. The method uses bearing-only measurements that are robustly matched in three views. In our experiments we obtain them from vertical lines corresponding to natural landmarks. With these three view line-matches a trifocal tensor can be computed. This tensor contains the three views geometry and is used to estimate the aforementioned localization. As it is very usual to find a planar surface, we use the homography corresponding to that plane to obtain the tensor with one match less than the general case method. This implies lower computational complexity, mainly when trying a robust estimation, where we see a reduction in the number of iterations needed. Another advantage of obtaining an homography during the process is that it can help to automatically detect singular situations, such us totally planar scenes. It is shown that our proposal performs similarly to the general case method in a general scenario and better in case that we have some dominant plane in the scene. This paper includes simulated results proving this, as well as examples with real images, both with conventional and omnidirectional cameras",

        "abstract": "The increasing number of launched satellites per year, calls for solutions to keep free operational space for telecommunication systems in geo-synchronized orbit, as well as to avoid the endangering of space systems in LEO (low-Earth orbit) and of the public living in the habited parts on Earth. Examples for such dangerous stranded space systems in the past are Skylab and MIR. In the future, the uncontrolled and accidental de-orbiting of other huge satellites is expected, where parts of these will hit the surface of the Earth. A feasible way to handle such problems might be to enforce the operational requirement to use some dedicated residual fuel for a controlled de-orbiting, or in case of GEO (geostationary orbit), to lift the satellites at their end of life into the graveyard orbit. Despite these measures, malfunctions of solar generators, control systems or thrusters cannot be avoided. Therefore, on-orbit servicing (OOS) will be a mandatory and challenging topic for space robotics in the near future. The outcome of national German projects like ROTEX, ESS and GETEX/ETS-VII represent a know-how which can be directly applied for the development of OOS-robotic systems. Control structures and several possible operational modes are discussed within this paper. The recently started national project ROKVISS already provides the necessary space-qualified hardware as well as the very powerful telepresence operational mode. The paper will concentrate on a description of the ROKVISS mission",

Therefore, adaptive fuzzy control system is a good choice for such problem. However, due to approximation errors caused by the fuzzy system we need to ensure the robustness of the adaptive fuzzy controller by some mechanism. The adaptation law is designed based on Lyapunov synthesis approach. The dead zone is compensated by a fuzzy rule based one-step-ahead controller.

        "abstract": "This work describes a new 3D cone-shape illumination model (CSIM) and a robust background subtraction scheme involving shadow and highlight removal for indoor-environmental surveillance. Foreground objects can be precisely extracted for various post-processing procedures such as recognition. Gaussian mixture model (GMM) is applied to construct a color-based probabilistic background model (CBM) that contains the short-term color-based background model (STCBM) and the long-term color-based background model (LTCBM). STCBM and LTCBM are then proposed to build the gradient-based version of the probabilistic background model (GBM) and the CSIM. In the CSIM, a new dynamic cone-shape boundary in the RGB color space is proposed to distinguish pixels among shadow, highlight and foreground. Furthermore, CBM can be used to determine the threshold values of CSIM. A novel scheme combining the CBM, GBM and CSIM is proposed to determine the background. The effectiveness of the proposed method is demonstrated via experiments in a complex indoor environment",

        "abstract": "In this paper, the robust control problem for free-floating dual-arm space robot system with two objects is discussed. Firstly, the kinematics and dynamics of free-floating dual-arm space robot system with two objects are analysed. In order to overcome the difficulty that the dynamic equations of the system are nonlinearly dependent on inertial parameters, the system is modeled as under-actuated robot system, and the idea of augmentation approach is adopted. It is demonstrated that the dynamic equations of the system can be linearly dependent on a group of inertial parameters with augmented inputs and outputs. And then based on the above results, the robust control scheme for dual-arm space robot system with uncertain inertial parameters to track the desired trajectories in joint space is proposed. The proposed control scheme is computationally simple, because we guarantee the controller robust to the uncertain inertial parameters rather than explicitly estimating them online. In addition to this, it need not require controlling the position and attitude of the floating base. Finally, a planar free-floating dual-arm space robot system with two objects is simulated to verify the proposed control scheme",

Due to bandwidth limitations in current camera interfaces, like Firewire or USB, an increase in the camera resolution results in a drop of the effective frame-rate from the sensor. This increases the correspondence problem for point features in consecutive images due to significant motion of the features. We solve the correspondence problem for very significant motion of point features between consecutive images by analyzing the motion blur to estimate the current motion parameters. The proposed algorithm can be used to track the position of point features in video images originating from slow frame-rate cameras. The system is validated on real images from a camera moved by a mobile system, but it can be used for any type of motion ranging from flying systems to mobile robots operating in outdoor or indoor environments",

        "abstract": "In this paper, formation adaptation and stability for mobile multi-agent systems is studied. The objective is to suggest a set of robust control functions that can be combined to build complex formations of mobile robots. A properly designed formation should be able to follow a single leader in a clustered environment and to, if necessary, adapt to the surroundings by changing its shape. The two control algorithms proposed here are adapted for systems with limited communication capacity and low performance sensors. The algorithms only require information that can be directly achieved from on-board sensors and, in particular, they only need very coarse estimation of the velocity of the neighbors in the formation. An arbitrary change of the shape of a formation may require switching between control algorithms. In the paper, it is shown that switching between the two proposed control algorithms is stable under some reasonable assumptions. The results are verified by simulations, which also show that switching can be performed safely even with a high noise level and no prior filtering of sensor input",

These robust control laws include a PD feedback part, a dynamic feedforward compensator with nominal robot parameters and two robust dynamic feedforward compensations for parametric and unstructured uncertainties. The stability of the closed-loop system is established by the Lyapunov function. The system with the first proposed control law is proved to be globally uniformly asymptotically stable (GUAS) and the system with the second control law is proved to have uniformly ultimately bounded (UUB) tracking error. The radius of the ultimate boundedness set is also calculated. The tracking performance of this approach is satisfactory as the simulations carried out on a planar manipulator show",

The MCL matches ceiling structures like beams, columns, air condition and lightning installation against a world model containing line and point features. Thus the localization is not effected by clutter or any kind of dynamic obstacles on the ground level. Different experiments show that our system can be used to localize robustly in factory buildings and halls. Experimental results include a 5 day run of an autonomous fork lift truck on a logistics fair in Hannover",

Firstly, a multiple line fitting method is described, related with walls at the environment, which minimizes the sum of squared distances for contiguous lines and constitutes a global pattern with regular constrained angles. Secondly, beacons, related with columns at the environment, are estimated with the circle algebraic method. Two pose estimation methods are presented, based on detected beacons and lines. These methods have proved to be robust and faster than other methods. In addition to this, a redundant kinematic model is used for dead-reckoning sensors, which may improve estimations. Finally, the robot localization is performed with an EKF during normal navigation and a global localization method, based on Monte-Carlo simulation methods, at initialization.",

Environment and obstacle sensing is the key issue for mobile robot localization and navigation. Laser scanners cover 180deg and are accurate but too expensive. Radial range sensors such as laser scanners, IR scanners and ultrasonic range sensor rings have blind spots so that a small obstacle not close enough to the sensor may be easily missed. It is necessary to develop a low cost sensor system which covers 360deg with small blind spots. A sensor system with 12 IR range sensors is designed and implemented. The problem of the 2D sensor systems is, they measure the nearby obstacles on a plane where the sensors are located. In order to scan the environment vertically, a 2.5D sensor system is designed and the experimental result shows the effectiveness of the proposed sensor system",

In this paper we consider the problem of localizing a rover through 3D terrain registration in a natural environment. Two different local feature-based 3D terrain registration approaches are investigated: spin-image matching and point fingerprint matching. To overcome the huge memory storage problem of local features-based registration algorithms and improve the accuracy of the matching results, while reducing the computing time of the matching process, we developed an enhanced matching algorithm. The rover global localization scenario was conducted in the Mars Yard located at the Canadian Space Agency. The experimental results using natural environment data sensed by a high resolution and accurate 3D range sensor (LIDAR), demonstrate the effectiveness our enhanced matching algorithm",

        "abstract": "Scan-matching based on data from a laser scanner is frequently used for mapping and localization. This paper presents an scan-matching approach based instead on visual information from a stereo system. The scale invariant feature transform (SIFT) is used together with epipolar constraints to get high matching precision between the stereo images. Calculating the 3D position of the corresponding points in the world results in a visual scan where each point has a descriptor attached to it. These descriptors can be used when matching scans acquired from different positions. Just like in the work with laser based scan matching a map can be defined as a set of reference scans and their corresponding acquisition point. In essence this reduces each visual scan that can consist of hundreds of points to a single entity for which only the corresponding robot pose has to be estimated in the map. This reduces the overall complexity of the map. The SIFT descriptor attached to each of the points in the reference allows for robust matching and detection of loop closing situations. The paper presents real-world experimental results from an indoor office environment",

An imaging sonar is used to obtain information about the location of planar structures present in such environments. This information is incorporated into a feature-based SLAM algorithm in a two step process: (I) the full 360deg sonar scan is undistorted (to compensate for vehicle motion), thresholded and segmented to determine which measurements correspond to planar environment features and which should be ignored; and (2) SLAM proceeds once the data association is obtained: both the vehicle motion and the measurements whose correct association has been previously determined are incorporated in the SLAM algorithm. This two step delayed SLAM process allows to robustly determine the feature and vehicle locations in the presence of large amounts of spurious or unrelated measurements that might correspond to boats, rocks, etc. Preliminary experiments show the viability of the proposed approach",

The model of the unknown indoor environment is structured as an hybrid representation, both topological and metric, which is incrementally built during the exploration task. A global likelihood function is modeled from the geometric elastic relationships between different places of the environment, constrained by a rigid metric model inside each place. The inconsistencies in the final resulted map are minimized by deforming the hybrid model with the optimization of the global likelihood of the system by applying a relaxation methodology. Results are presented which shows the minimization of inconsistencies related to an autonomous constructed hybrid model by the application of the proposed methodology",

        "abstract": "This paper presents a mathematical model for saccadic motion and fixations. We relate this issue to the problem of motion planning and show that a family of artificial potential functions can be used for creating saccadic motion. The advantage of this approach is that finding the next fixation point does not require an explicit visual search - which is computationally costly and may be problematic in real-time applications. Rather, the system naturally 'slides' from the current fixation into the next. Thus real-time performance on cheap hardware can easily be achieved. Experimental results serve to provide insight into the performance of a robot APES implementing this approach",

We consider the case of a car-like robot moving in an indoor environment (three-dimensional space). The extended Kalman filter (EKF) is a popular way to localize such a robot and to estimate its configuration uncertainty during navigation. Consequently, we supply an EKF with simulated measurements in order to compute realistic uncertainties (in a four-dimensional space) during path planning. We show that our safe-RRT algorithm, based upon rapidly-exploring random trees (RRT), is an efficient way to find a path in the resulting seven-dimensional uncertain configuration space",

        "abstract": "In the immediate future, metrics related to safety and dependability have to be found in order to successfully introduce robots in everyday environments. The crucial issues needed to tackle the problem of a safe and dependable physical human-robot interaction (pHRI) were addressed in the EURON Perspective Research Project PHRIDOM (Physical Human- Robot Interaction in Anthropic Domains), aimed at charting the new \"territory\" of pHRI. While there are certainly also \"cognitive\" issues involved, due to the human perception of the robot (and vice versa), and other objective metrics related to fault detection and isolation, the discussion in this paper will focus on the peculiar aspects of \"physical\" interaction with robots. In particular, safety and dependability will be the underlying evaluation criteria for mechanical design, actuation, and control architectures. Mechanical and control issues will be discussed with emphasis on techniques that provide safety in an intrinsic way or by means of control components. Attention will be devoted to dependability, mainly related to sensors, control architectures, and fault handling and tolerance. After PHRIDOM, a novel research project has been launched under the Information Society Technologies Sixth Framework Programme of the European Commission. This \"Specific Targeted Research or Innovation\" project is dedicated to \"Physical Human-Robot Interaction: depENDability and Safety\" (PHRIENDS). PHRIENDS is about developing key components of the next generation of robots, including industrial robots and assist devices, designed to share the environment and to physically interact with people. The philosophy of the project proposes an integrated approach to the co-design of robots for safe physical interaction with humans, which revolutionizes the classical approach for designing industrial robots \u2013 rigid design for accuracy, active control for safety \u2013 by creating a new paradigm: design robots that are intrinsically safe, and control ...

Our approach is based on fluid dynamics through which we model the sensor network as a fluid body and each sensor node as a fluid element. Originating from local neighborhood interactions, the principles of fluid flow are adapted to the deployment of the sensor network. Mimicking the diffusive and self-spreading behavior of compressible fluids in a mobile sensor network, we achieve the desirable properties of effective coverage, scalability, and distributed self-deployment. An adaptive deployment scheme is also devised for urban disaster environments where the number of nodes to be deployed may not be determined a priori. Simulation results show that our approach can guarantee a desired level coverability",

We present a systematic and optimization-based approach to the problem, from the high-level to the low-level control. In particular, in the first part we develop a new algorithm for scanning the sphere using multiple cameras. The algorithm combines information about the environment and a model of target movement, to perform optimal scanning by means of stochastic dynamic programming. In the second part we develop a model-based control strategy for target tracking. A switching optimal control strategy based on smooth pursuit and saccades is designed by means of explicit model predictive control (MPC) theory. We simulated and experimentally validated our theory on a robotic chameleon head composed of two independent pan-tilt cameras. The resulting scanning pattern and target tracking has a remarkable resemblance to the one seen in nature by chameleons",

        "abstract": "One of the most graceful phenomena widely observed in nature is self-assembly; living systems spontaneously form their body structure through the developmental process. While this remarkable phenomenon still leaves much to be understood in biology, the concept of self-assembly becomes undeniably indispensable also in artificial systems as they increase in size and complexity. Based on this consideration, this paper discusses the realization of self-assembly with the use of a modular robot. The main contributions of this paper are two-fold: the first concerns the exploitation of emergent phenomena stemming from the interplay between the control and mechanical systems; the second is related to the implementation of the different adhesiveness among the modules. Here, form generation by self-assembly is considered as the result of time evolution toward the most dynamically stable state. Owing to this, the proposed method also satisfies significant ability of self-repair without making any modification to the proposed algorithm. Simulation results show that stable and spontaneous self-assembly is achieved irrespective of the initial positional relationship among the modules",

The swarm may eventually stop moving or exhibit complex spiral motion due to asymmetry of the coupling structure. The model in this paper is more general than isotropic swarms and our results provide further insight into the effect of the interaction pattern on individual motion in a swarm system",

        "abstract": "In this paper we present a semi-automated device designed and developed to deliver radio-active seeds for treating prostate cancer. In the brachytherapy procedure a slander needle is inserted through the perineum and passed through different types of tissues. Thus, the needle experiences significant amount of force which may cause it to buckle and bend. In our design, we have considered the buckling force and insertion force on needle by collecting invivo data from real patient and performing in-vitro experiments. Techniques to reduce force and organ/tissue deformation have been implemented into this new design. To track the axial force on the needle for detecting pubic arch interference and to improve robotic control, we have incorporated three force sensors. Rigidity and factor of safety of the device has been analyzed using finite element method which was very useful for iterative design process.",

        "abstract": "Unknown environment motion planning with no world model is a daunting task, especially for higher order manipulators. Sensor based planning is a dominant trend for planners in unknown environments. However, unknown environment planning, while important, still falls short of practical solutions for higher order manipulators. An amelioration proposed herein is to make use of a ramification of model-based approaches with mobile sensation. In this paper, we demonstrate how randomized planning techniques developed for model-based planners can be adopted to deal with planning problems of higher order manipulators in the midst of unknown obstacles. No other study has reported useful results on unknown environment planning utilizing model-based theories. The proposed planner is rendered to handle cases where non-sequential random sampling or randomized road map generation is infeasible due to the absence of a world model. For simplicity, the classical lattice planner, or incremental grid sampling, is considered with mobile sensation for probabilistically biased searches. For mobile sensation, we introduce a novel collision detection sensor, namely infrared proximity array (IPA), that is designed to enable samplings in an unknown configuration space. The proposed planner together with the IPA demonstrated some useful results on unknown environment planning problems utilizing a model-based sampling approach. As a performance measure of the planner, resolution completeness of the proposed planner is investigated from the topological standpoint as well",

In this paper we discuss the issue of localization in the context of sensor network assisted telerobotics. The sensor network is used to feedback information to the robot or remote operator to be used to efficiently and safely navigate. We show that coarse localization results in comparable performance to accurate and fine localization. This finding relaxes the requirement from localization algorithms and would open the door to a new class of reduced complexity and reduced overhead localization algorithms. Experimental results are provided to highlight the concepts developed and compare performance",

Such indirect ways are pervasive in human-human interaction; enabling the robot to understand them can make human-robot interaction more human-friendly. This paper presents a model for a robot that pursues its serving duties by trying to interpret indirect ways of expressing requests to execute certain actions.

        "abstract": "Several insights gained from observing quadruped robots in omnidirectional static walking experiments at high speed on a slope are presented here. In order to allow a robot to move as fast as possible, the height of center of gravity (COG) and three rotating axes, i.e., roll, pitch, and yaw, were used to discuss the COG with the corresponding optimal body posture (COBP). The COBP is the posture in which the motion velocity is maximized according to the height of COG, stability, degree of slope, and direction. Successive gait transition with a minimum number of steps is achievable with the use of a common foot position before and after a gait transition. The time required to change gaits may be reduced by designing the foot positions during crawling and rotating while limiting reachable region of the foot on a slope. The robot, thus, walks in any direction fast and statically with COBP by dynamically changing the height of COG and body posture during gait transitions",

Instead of focussing on properties of obstacles, we emphasize the description of free-space. We introduce the concept of signature graphs which is a compact data structure describing available free-space of an environment. It therefore also represents a map of the environment. A signature is an edge in the graph and is defined by seven parameters. An edge indicates that it is possible for the vehicle to move between two graph nodes. The signature graph is flexible and can easily be updated as new information about the environment is collected. We have with an autonomous wheelchair implemented our methods and tests them with successful results",

In this study, this type of intension was given as the objective function and acquisition of motion pattern, and was simulated as an optimization or learning problem. In addition, dynamically changing the intension according to the process of development, caused the motion pattern of the infant robot to change, and it developed from sitting to crawling, toward locomotion. We investigated the process of this type of development of the infant robot with numerical simulations",

This paper presents a combination of methods in solving the SLAM problem in a constricted indoor environment using small baseline stereo vision. Main contributions include a feature selection and tracking algorithm, a stereo noise filter, a robust feature validation algorithm and a multiple hypotheses adaptive window positioning method in 'closing the loop'. These methods take a novel approach in that information from the image processing and robotic navigation domains are used in tandem to augment each other. Experimental results including a real-time implementation in an office-like environment are also presented",

        "abstract": "Extended range telepresence allows a human user to intuitively teleoperate a mobile robot through arbitrarily large remote environments by natural walking. In order to give the user the possibility to navigate the robot through an arbitrarily large remote environments, while his own environment is of limited size, motion compression is used. The motion compression framework provides a nonlinear transformation between the user's path and the robot's path, which preserves path length and turning angles. There is, however, a difference in path curvature, which is minimized in order to guarantee a high degree of immersion. A major drawback of the current system is its inability to deal with non-convex time-variant environments or environments shared by multiple users. This paper presents a systematic approach to extending motion compression to non-convex environments. This solution will then be used to cover the multi-user case",

The problem of kinematic and algorithmic singularities is addressed via the singularity-consistent method developed in our previous research. Experimental data shows vibration suppression with high efficiency. When no vibrations are present, our approach ensures effective reactionless motion. The stability of the system under teleoperation and while moving around algorithmic and kinematic singularities is also demonstrated",

In conventional research, recurrent neural networks are often used for such memory functions. However, they cannot memorize a lot of patterns and its learning algorithm is unreliable. In this paper, we propose a method for the induction of behavior and situational estimation based on hidden Markov models, which is currently one of the most useful stochastic models. With the proposed method, we show the feasibility of: (1) Both recognition and association are executed at the same time, and (2) A multiple degrees of freedom and multiple sensorimotor patterns are acceptable",

We propose a practical method for smooth motion reshaping to avoid collisions in generated dynamic motion. Based on motion editing techniques in computer graphics animation, smooth collision-avoiding motion is generated through trajectory deformation. The validity of the proposed reshaping method is verified by computer simulations and experiments using humanoid platform HRP-2",

The main idea is to use a projector to transfer energy and to provide global positioning information to the robots that are equipped with multi-segment solar cells on their top. First tests with a 3000 ANSI lumens beamer projecting a white image showed a scavenged power of 7.1 and 27.8 muW/mm2 for commercially available crystalline silicon solar cells and for thin film amorphous silicon solar cell respectively. Regarding the Global Positioning System, the projector sends regularly a sequence of 17 images and the robot decodes them using two independent solar cell segments acting as photodiodes in order to calculate its own position and orientation inside a defined arena. First experimental results on a large scale prototype are presented. For 2.65 times 2.65 mm2 photodiodes the x, y and angular resolution are 4 mm, 3 mm and 6 degrees respectively inside an arena of 512times384 mm2  and the duration of the sequence is 0.85 s",

        "abstract": "Being able to locate the origin of a sound is important for our capability to interact with the environment. Humans can locate a sound source in both the horizontal and vertical plane with only two ears, using the head related transfer function HRTF, or more specifically features like interaural time difference ITD, interaural level difference ILD, and notches in the frequency spectra. In robotics notches have been left out since they are considered complex and difficult to use. As they are the main cue for humans' ability to estimate the elevation of the sound source this have to be compensated by adding more microphones or very large and asymmetric ears. In this paper, we present a novel method to extract the notches that makes it possible to accurately estimate the location of a sound source in both the horizontal and vertical plane using only two microphones and human-like ears. We suggest the use of simple spiral-shaped ears that has similar properties to the human ears and make it easy to calculate the position of the notches. Finally we show how the robot can learn its HRTF and build audiomotor maps using supervised learning and how it automatically can update its map using vision and compensate for changes in the HRTF due to changes to the ears or the environment.",

We have implemented a simple but useful audio propagation simulator as an extension to the stage multi-robot simulator. We use the simulator to evaluate the use of audio signals to improve the performance of a team of robots at a prototypical search task. The results indicate that, for this task, (i) audio can significantly improve team performance, and (ii) binary discrimination of the direction of a sound source (left/right) performs no worse than high-resolution direction information.

In this paper we describe how to reduce the number of images in this database with minimal loss of information and thereby increasing the efficiency of localization significantly. First we build an appearance based model consisting of a graph in which the nodes denote images and links denote relations between images. This graph is then pruned using the connected dominating set algorithm. The method is tested on an image set acquired by a mobile robot equipped with an omnidirectional camera driving around in an office environment, as well as sets of images taken while driving through a real furnished home environment",

        "abstract": "Presented in this paper is an approach to realtime spatial reasoning for manipulative robotic tasks. When a service robot is requested to manipulate an object, it should determine the directions along which it can access and remove the object. The potential accessible directions for the object are retrieved from the object database. Then, spatial reasoning with the surrounding environment and the gripper geometry is invoked to verify the directions. The verification process mainly utilizes the visibility test of the commodity graphics hardware. Then, the directions along which both of the object and gripper are translated without colliding with the surrounding obstacles are computed using Minkowski sum and cube map of the graphics hardware. The access and removal directions are passed to the potential field path planning algorithm to determine the robot arm's full path for accessing, removing and delivering the object. The experimental results show the feasibility of using graphics hardware for manipulative robotic tasks and further its performance gain in real-time manipulation.",

Existing methods of programming responses include event loops, reactive languages and hybrid architectures, none of which meet the specific needs of mobile robot programming. This work presents a design for new semantics for specifying reactivity in mobile robot programs, one that allows for effective specification of reactive behaviour within procedural robot programs. An initial evaluation version is implemented in Python. Events and responses are supported as program objects, and are connected together by new statements. Programmers specify connections between events and responses anywhere within the program code, so connections can easily be changed in response to changes in program and robot state",

In addition, this paper considers sound source separation in order to recognize and isolate spectral cues only from the sound source in order to make the method robust to extraneous noise. Furthermore the authors designed an audio servo with the proposed spectral cues and implemented the method in an actual robot. The experimental results confirmed the effectiveness of the method",

Thus, it combines the network function with the current concept of a robot in order to enhance mobility and human interface. The main characteristics of this video are to combine of text-independent speaker recognition and Korean-based spontaneous speech recognition from two speakers in scenario. Especially each speaker communicates with service robot through spontaneous speech recognition with continuous words to provide useful information such as daily life schedule and TV program suitable to the speaker recognized. On the basis of these components, consumers will be able to utilize various speech-based services of the robot.",

The goals of the vision processing were to locate and track both the blastocysts and manipulation pipettes within the images and throughout the microinjection process. This was successfully accomplished using Hough transforms and cross-correlation template matching. Emphasis here is placed on a detailed description of the techniques applied to the algorithm to speed-up the matching and to enable real-time visual feedback. These techniques allowed the algorithm to be, on average, 857 times faster than the original algorithm. This converts into a 99.88% reduction in the template matching processing time",

We showed that the application of wave variable formalism allows the passivity of the system in spite of the communication delays between the master and the slave and the varying scaling factors. Conditions of the passivity and of the transparency are given for the micro teleoperation system. Finally, experimental results are presented showing the stability-transparency performances of the resulting system with constant and variable time-delay",

        "abstract": "Image moments provide an important class of image features used for image-based visual servo control. Spherical image moments have the additional desirable property that they are invariant under rotation of the camera frame. For these features one can study the local and global stability and performance of the position control independently of the rotation control. In this paper we study a range of control algorithms including the classical approximately linearising control, a recently proposed robust control based on Lyapunov function design methodology, and modifications of these designs to improve global and asymptotic performance and robustness of the schemes. The comparison of performance demonstrates that the choice of image feature and control design for image-based visual servo are each equally important and highly coupled. We finally propose a control law using a modified image feature and a Lyapunov control design that ensures global asymptotic stability and good performance equally in image space as in task space",

Firstly, some preliminary kinematics of this sensor is presented. Coordinates attached to every links are established, and the transforming relations between link frames and other frames are derived. Then, the static measuring model and the deadweight compensation of the sensor are produced. In the modeling, forces on links are composed based on an analytic method, and the resultant forces and torques obtained can be used as the measuring model. The weight need to be compensated of the whole mechanism is divided into two parts: links weights and top platform weight. The compensation of the links weights is involved in static modeling. And the top platform weight is compensated, subsequently. Finally, some experiments are carried out, and the results verify the validity of the static measuring model and the deadweight compensation",

This paper presents the stiffness modeling of a three-prismatic-revolute-cylindrical (3-PRC) CPM with orthogonally mounted actuators, that is designed to provide three spatial translational DOF for nano scale manipulation. A straightforward method is developed to establish the analytical stiffness model for a spatial CPM by considering the compliance of each compliant element, which is then applied to stiffness modeling of the 3-PRC CPM. Furthermore, the finite element analysis is carried out to validate the developed model. And to demonstrate the utility of the stiffness model, the influence of architectural parameters on stiffness factors is analyzed, which is valuable for a cost-effective design of the CPM",

Moreover, it means that conversion into its own motion, which is adoptable to its body structure, by integrating with its prior knowledge. From this perspective, a new imitation scheme is proposed. The scheme is based on hidden Markov models by employing Viterbi algorithm. The proposed scheme enables to imitate a new observed motion without learning the motion by applying its prior knowledge. Online motion primitive acquisition method is considered. Evaluation factors, such as inheritance coordinate and matching error, are introduced to evaluate imitation performance. The feasibility of the proposed scheme is demonstrated by simulation on a 20 degrees of freedom humanoid robot configuration with the evaluation factors",

        "abstract": "Inspection robot must plan its behavior to detect the obstacles from the complex background according to their types when it is crawling along the power transmission line in order to negotiate reliably. However, in most instances, detecting the obstacles from the complex background is a hard task. For this purpose, a novel and fast visual obstacle recognition algorithm is designed based on the structure of the 220 KV power transmission line. Basic principle and architecture of the algorithm are given. By this approach, three typical obstacles on the power transmission line such as insulator strings, counterweights and suspension clamps can be recognized with high accuracy. Experiments in the real power transmission line show its effectiveness. This method can contribute to the process of the mobile robot negotiating obstacles",

This paper focuses on KDCs for parallel manipulators which are described in detail. The relationship between input and output of a system with KDCs is discussed and the characteristics of its transfer matrix are educed. Then, the kinematics of two parallel manipulators, a 6-PSS parallel micro-manipulator with perpendicular structures (PMMWPS) and a 6-PP+S parallel manipulator with perpendicular structures (PMWPS), is analyzed. Also, the kinematics models are obtained. In the course of the analysis, conditional decoupling is defined. The results show that the two proposed PMWPSs have KDCs. The KDCs for PMWPSs would offer a new idea in the area of parallel manipulators",

A survey of different microhandling systems based on the use of ice is also given. Then submerged microgripper with frozen water as an active end-effector is proposed as a promising new approach for manipulating low thermal conductive micro-objects. A prototype using the Peltier effect has been numerically modeled and developed. It is described in the paper. Experimental results validate the cooling and warming of the freeze gripper. A generic micromanipulation task is the purpose of further work",

The method is based first on the dissociation of the search of optimal transfer time T from that of optimal trajectory profiles. Kinematic and dynamic constraints can then be treated in an easy manner because most of them can be transformed into bounds on the value of T. In addition, trajectory profiles are generated using trapezoidal velocity profiles that reduce the number of optimization parameters to two only. This makes the real-time trajectory generation possible and its implementation on existing industrial controllers quite easy. Furthermore, a stochastic optimization method is suggested to obtain a good approximation of the global optimal motion.",

        "abstract": "Planar quadratic potential fields are useful for distributed manipulation because they are readily analyzable and naturally produce predictable equilibria. This generally simplifies implementation since feedback and control may not be necessary. Traditionally, to dynamically produce moving fields for complex manipulation tasks, these fields had to be realized by highly capable but redundant actuator arrays. This paper suggests a new method: using simpler devices to generate basic component fields, and superposing these fields to produce desired fields with similar degrees of freedom. This approach is particularly useful for naturally produced force fields which do not allow the dynamic moving and changing of a field but allow for superposition and thus can be spatially combined to produce the desired net behaviors. A vector representation of these fields is developed and applied to two problems: How to place the fields in space to span the maximum possible configuration space, and how to generate an optimal solution to generate a desired field by a superposition of a fixed field arrangement with minimal effort from each field. Finally, we experimentally validated these methods using airflow fields based on phenomenological and time superposition",

        "abstract": "This paper presents an approach to create topological maps from geometric maps obtained with a mobile robot in an indoor-environment using range data. Our approach utilizes AdaBoost, a supervised learning algorithm, to classify each point of the geometric map into semantic classes. We then apply a segmentation procedure based on probabilistic relaxation labeling on the resulting classifications to eliminate errors. The topological graph is then extracted from the individual different regions and their connections. In this way, we obtain a topological map in the form of a graph, in which each node indicates a region in the environment with its corresponding semantic class (e.g., corridor, or room) and the edges indicate the connections between them. Experimental results obtained with data from different real-world environments demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach",

The developed master system is designed based on human pinching motion and can be manipulated intuitively. The feedback loop of the developed slave system is closed at the slave side and the slave robotic hand can manipulate an object reliably. Three experiments are executed to confirm that the slave hand pinches objects and controls their orientation angle easily even time delay exists",

        "abstract": "This paper describes a unique approach of applying a pattern classification technique to robot path planning. A collision-free path connecting a start and a goal point provides information on the division of the space. In the case of 2D path planning, for example, the path divides the space into two regions. This suggests a dual problem of first dividing the whole space into such two regions and then picking up the boundary as a path. We develop a method of solving this dual problem using support vector machine (SVM). SVM generates a nonlinear separating surface based on the margin maximization principle. This property is suitable for the purpose of usual path planning problems, that is, generating a safe and smooth path. The details of the path planning methods in 2D and 3D spaces are described with several planning results. Future possibilities of combining the proposed concept with other path planning methodologies are also discussed",

        "abstract": "Model-based recognition of an object typically involves matching dense 3D range data. The computational cost is directly affected by the amount of data of which a transformation needs to be found before carrying out the match against a model. This paper investigates recognition using \"one-dimensional\" data, more specifically, points sampled along three concurrent curves on the surface of an object. The introduced method determines the quality of match against a model in two steps. First, the Gaussian and mean curvatures at the curve intersection point are estimated and used in a table lookup to find multiple candidate points on the model that have similar local geometry. Second, starting at each point, local optimization is conducted to search for a possible location of the curve intersection on the model as well as an orientation that leads to a good match of all data points. The best match between the model and the data curves is chosen over the results obtained from all candidate points. The quality of this match is used for comparison against other models. Simulation and experiment have been conducted to validate the recognition approach",

However, the locomotion is a synchronized motion, which means that these signals are related. Using this property, we propose a new method for modeling the human locomotion and identifying this model. The input signals of our model is the trajectory of pelvis and the outputs are corresponding motion signals of whole human body. To identify this system, we considered it as black-box, for which we propose an adapted method of identification using motion capture. We show that the identified model allows to generate various human locomotion in a fast and efficient way",

        "abstract": "We propose a new method of tactile sensing for a fingertip of robotic hand based on the analysis of the mechanical constraints imposed to the contact between the fingertip and the contacting object. Using a simple fingertip with soft surface cover and a six-axis force/torque sensor, a new function is developed to measure direction of local geometry of a class of objects when the fingertip contacts with them. The developed function is useful not only to plan strategies for stable grasp and dexterous manipulation but also to recognize a geometrical shape of an object. Two necessary components, a six-axis force/torque sensor and a soft skin, are commercially available. They neither restrict design of a robotic fingertip nor badly affect essential functions of stable grasping and manipulation",

As one of the tangible interface, tactile interface is essential for many exploration and manipulation tasks in the tangible space. In this paper, we suggest a design of an integrated tactile sensor-display system that enables both of tactile sensing and display with kinesthetic force, pressure distribution, and vibration. A human-like tactile sensing system with PVDF strips and a display system with bimorph actuators have been developed and integrated in the tangible space. In the demonstration scenario of haptic navigation in the tangible space, the developed tactile sensing to display system is successfully experimented.",

In vocalization, the vibration of vocal cords generates a source sound, and then the sound wave is led to a vocal tract, which works as a resonance filter to determine the spectrum envelope. The robot consists of motor-controlled vocal organs such as vocal cords, a vocal tract and a nasal cavity to generate a natural voice imitating a human vocalization. The paper briefly introduces the construction of vocal cords and vocal tract for the realization of the talking robot, and then describes how the robot autonomously acquires the vocalization skill in the auditory feedback learning by listening to human talking and singing voices. The acquired voices were evaluated by listening experiments",

        "abstract": "Significant research have been devoted into the field of multi-robot teleoperation system over Internet. However, the low safety and efficiency due to time delay and complexity between multiple robots and operators prevent the teleoperation technology from developing. Specially, the possible collision between multiple robots has a great effect on the Internet-based multi-operator-multi-robot teleoperation system. In this paper, a task planner based on Petri net theory was proposed to assist multi-operators coordinate multi-robots. The conception of implicit elementary operation and explicit elementary operation were introduced to realize modeling and automatic plan of the system. In the multi-operator multi-robot system built by us, a supervisory controller was designed based on the place invariants not only to lead two operators' manipulation with virtual environment but also to restrict the state of two robots' motion during their work. An experiment via network was carried out to evaluate the validity of the task planner for the medical research of highly dangerous virus such as SARS, bird flu etc. The experimental results show that the safety and efficiency of the system can be improved using the task planner",

        "abstract": "Since the tracking error does not truly reflect product quality, the contouring error is introduced in the dynamic control of parallel machining systems. For real-time computation reason, the contouring error is approximated by the distance from the actual position to the tangent plane of the desired contour at the corresponding desired position, i.e., the error in normal direction. By attaching a moving task frame to each point on a desired trajectory, the tracking error is decomposed into tangential error and normal error. By the transformation introduced by the task frame, we obtain error dynamics in the task frame. The error dynamics is decoupled into error dynamics in tangential and normal directions by applying the computed torque control and choosing appropriate system matrices. Simulation shows that a larger bandwidth of the normal dynamics leads to smaller contouring error given fixed natural frequency for the tangential dynamics. By a comparison with the PD control in the world frame, the task space based contouring control exhibits much better performance in contouring accuracy",

A small planar-distributed pin array is developed. The array can represent micro-scale shapes with various surfaces, such as gratings, grooves, patterns, shapes of icons, and Braille, and provides the user with cutaneous stimuli. Since the tactile display unit is small enough to be embedded into a computer mouse, we developed a new texture display mouse. The performance of its texture display capability was verified. In addition, two psychophysical experiments have been conducted in order to ascertain the influence of vibrotactile stimuli. The first experiment showed that vibrational stimuli could be effective in the perception of patterns while from the second experiment, the functional relation between perceived roughness and components of vibrotactile stimuli was obtained. The experimental results have been applied to the development of a test-bed program",

        "abstract": "A magnetic localization and orientation system is proposed for tracking wireless capsule endoscope. This system uses a small magnet enclosed in the capsule to serve as excitation source. When the capsule moves, the magnet establishes a static magnetic field around. With the magnetic sensor array composed of Honeywell 3-axis magnetic sensors, HMC1053, the magnetic intensities in some pre-determined spatial points can be detected, and the magnet's position and orientation parameters can be computed based on an algorithm. To initiate the system and obtain better tracking accuracy, we propose a calibration technique for the magnetic tracking system. The calibration includes sensitivity determination and nonlinearity adjustment, sensor center position and orientation adjustment. Based on the calibration procedures, the system can achieve satisfactory tracking accuracy with the average localization error 3.3 mm and the average orientation error 3.0deg",

However, the lack of complete solutions for interchange between platforms has hampered its application as no efficient device can record the entire procedure of human handwriting behavior. In this paper, we design a force Tablet (F-Tablet) for human-computer-interaction (HCI), which can acquire the kinematics and kinetics information of human handwriting, including strokes of pen-up and pen-down, pen nib trajectory and three-axis forces of pen tip directly and simultaneously. Any stylus- and pen-like device can be used to write on it. The core part of the system, named as F-Tablet, is introduced and its ink was defined according to InkML format. An improved DTW (dynamic time warping) algorithm is also put forward to verify the online signatures based on the digital handwriting forces vector ink. The iterative experiment is introduced to decide weights for writing forces in different direction and the classification threshold",

Also driven by one motor and transmitted by springs, the mid finger, the ring finger and the little finger can move simultaneously and envelop objects with complex shape. On the other hand, during the hand designation, the handsome appearance has been considered and its glove prototype has been designed. The hardware system and the sensory system have been developed. Through Bluetooth wireless protocol, the hand can be controlled by voice signal. Furthermore, it can also be controlled by electromyography (EMG) signal like most prosthetic hand in existence. It has been verified by experiments that the hand has strong capability of self-adaptation grasp and can accomplish precise and power grasp",

        "abstract": "We are motivated to deal with a biped robot by the existence of an almighty powerful control mechanism of a human. Although a visual information, in particular, plays an important role in order to realize admirable intelligence in a humanoid robot, we must assert a vision to be one of the developing sensors. In fact, there are many difficulties of both aspects of restrictive hardware resources for a vision and real-time image processing for motor control. In this paper, we clarify a structure and a nature of a visual information processing system which should be equipped with a biped robot. For this purpose, a human eye structure and its movements, and brain motor control through a central nervous system are considered as an analogy with robotics. We shall show that a gaze control mechanism like human is absolutely indispensable for a vision system of a biped robot. Furthermore, we investigate considerable differences between the human eyes and the biped robot ones. This allows us to propose a new, simple and intuitively understandable criteria, called stably gazing scope, for evaluating gaze control performance in the sense of availability of visual information for robot motion control",

The 3-D locomotion and posture control are implemented by synthesizing three basic control methods speed control, orientation control and pitching control, which are described in detail respectively.

        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "This paper presents the resection filter, which is a new filter for fusing bearings to known landmarks with a prior Gaussian pose estimate. The filter calculates a robot's pose based on noisy bearings independently from any prior pose estimate and then fuses this value with a prior pose estimate. Implementations of the extended Kalman filter and unscented Kalman filter are described and several experiments are conducted comparing the proposed filter with these two benchmarks. The results show that the new filter outperforms both benchmarks in nearly all the areas we considered, at least for problems in which bearing information is readily available",

It is used in front-end processing of speech recognition system as filter bank instead of original FIR filter bank for improving the system performance. The paper gave the concept and parameter setting method of Bark wavelet. At the same time, the paper also presents an improved feature: CZCPA (combining zero-crossings with peak amplitudes) based on ZCPA feature. The new feature includes the information of speech signals and its difference signal. It can improve system performance to some extent. The recognition network uses HMM. The experiment results show that the results of using CZCPA feature with Bark wavelet filters as front-end processor are superior to the results of using ZCPA feature with FIR filter as front-end in speech recognition system",

For convenience in judge, the conception of minimal stability distance (MSD) is introduced and based on the general criterion, the shortest distance from supporting edge to the vertical projection point of robot center of gravity on ground is used to embody the general criterion mentioned above indirectly. By simulation, the relations between stability and parameters such as disturb elements, height of center of gravity, obliquity of supporting plane and mass of robot are discussed.

        "abstract": "The reactive navigation of a non-holonomic mobile robot implies selecting at each instant of time a motion command satisfying two conditions: to avoid collisions and to comply with the robot non-holonomic constraints. Most proposed reactive navigation approaches deal with these requirements simultaneously in an indivisible way. This paper proposes a clear separation of these problems by introducing a representation space where a robot losses its kinematics restrictions and can be dealt as a \"free-flying-point.\" The collision avoidance can therefore be solved by existing holonomic methods, which are able to steer non-holonomic, any-shaped robots when applied in this space, named the trajectory parameter space (TP-space). We also formalize the transformation between this space and the robot physical space introducing the parameterized trajectory generator (PTG), a translation between both spaces by means of a family of parameterized trajectories. This formalization is addressed in a generalized form to allow us deriving any number of different transformations. Unlike previous non-holonomic approaches that use just one single transformation, the proposed method considers a variety of them simultaneously which becomes an obvious improvement to reactive approaches: each one can detect a collision-free path that the others can not. We present some experimental results to show the suitability of our method and its advantages compared with traditional approaches",

        "abstract": "Using our developed acoustical telepresence robot, TeleHead, we have so far confirmed that not only stationary binaural features but also dynamic cues due to head movement play important roles in auditory localization. In this study, aiming towards the realization of an ideal acoustical telepresence robot, we clarified the relation between the speed of head movement and the accuracy of auditory localization in listening experiments. We examined the effect of two head-movement factors on sound localization accuracy: observation from multiple postures and the obtainment of dynamical information during head movement. The results suggest that both factors improve the accuracy of sound localization in experiments. Moreover, even when we can use only one of these factors, the accuracy of sound localization is almost the same as the subject's original accuracy. The results confirm that even under very bad communication, control, and head shape conditions, it may be possible to get a system to actually work. They also mean that there is a possibility of building an acoustical telepresence robot with a dummy head of a general shape. This is meaningful from the viewpoint of engineering. In addition, it suggests the strong robustness of the human auditory sound localization function",

        "abstract": "In face-to-face communication, eyes play a central role, for example in directing attention and regulating turn-taking. For this reason, it has been a central topic in several fields of interaction study. Although many psychology findings have encouraged previous work in both human-computer and human-robot interaction studies, so far there have been few explorations on how to move the agent's eye, including when to move it, for communication. Therefore, it is this topic we address in this study. The impression a person forms from an interaction is strongly influenced by the degree to which their partner's gaze direction correlates with their own. In this paper, we propose methods of controlling a robot's gaze responsively to its partner's gaze and confirm the effect of this on the feeling of being looked at, which is considered to be the basis of conveying impressions using gaze in face-to-face interaction experiments. Furthermore, an additional preliminary experiment with an on-screen agent shows the possibility of using blinking behaviour as another modality for responding to a partner",

We consider several cases corresponding to different odometry systems and different types of robot sensors. Finally, we also consider the problem of maximizing the calibration accuracy and we formulate this problem as an optimal control problem.

We have designed a mechanism to allow motion generation and execution to occur in parallel such that collision-free motions can be generated in real time.

        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "A blimp-type unmanned aerial vehicle (BUAV) maintains its longitudinal motion using buoyancy provided by the air around it. This means the density of a BUAV equals that of the surrounding air. Because of this, the motion of a BUAV is seriously affected by flow disturbances, whose distribution is usually non-uniform and unknown. In addition, the inertia in the heading motion is very large. There is also a strict limitation on the weight of equipment in the BUAV, so most BUAVs are so-called under-actuated robots. From this situation, it can be said that the motion planning of the BUAV considering the stochastic property of the disturbance is needed for obstacle avoidance. In this paper, we propose an approach to the motion planning of the BUAV via the application of Markov decision process (MDP). The proposed approach consists of a method to prepare a discrete MDP model of the BUAV motion and a method to maintain the effect of the unknown wind on the BUAVs motion. The performance of the methods is examined by dynamical simulation of the BUAV in the environment with wind disturbance",

        "abstract": "Though a large number continuum robots exist, little work has been done to accurately and effectively visualize these devices in three dimensions. Like octopus arms and elephant trunks, these robots lack discrete joints, instead bending in smooth, continuous curves. Three-dimensional visualization of traditional rigid-link robots is both well established and extensively used in modeling, simulation, design, and operation of these robots. Providing three-dimensional visualization techniques extends these benefits, considered essential for rigid-link robots, to continuum robots. This paper presents a highly flexible three-dimensional visualization technique which executes in realtime for a large class of continuum robots. The results of this technique are then applied to two different continuum manipulators which are representative of most continuum robot designs, demonstrating the wide applicability of this method",

Contrary to many existing dense image based topological localisation techniques that operate in known maps, our method builds topological maps in unknown environments. And unlike traditional topological mapping methods that require the robot to explicitly recognise topological path junctions during exploration, our method requires no such explicit \"junction detectors\". It receives as input only a sequence of unlabeled images. The validity of the approach has been demonstrated in both indoor and outdoor environments. The largest outdoor map created measures 70 by 40 meters with 3 nested loops. The system has shown robustness towards large amounts of sensor aliasing and noise caused by errors in the path following behaviours",

Thus, they have to be able to report their current state and whereabouts in a way that is comprehensible for the user. Pure metric maps do not usually correspond to the understanding of the environment a user would provide. Thus, the robotic map needs to be integrated with the human representation. This paper describes our framework of human augmented mapping that allows us to achieve this integration. We propose further a method to specify and represent regions that relate to a user's view on the environment. We assume an interactive setup for the specification of regions and show the applicability of our method in terms of distinctiveness for space segmentation and in terms of localisation purposes",

Topological navigation consists of topological mapping and obstacle avoidance navigation. In this environment, it has two major problems which are 1) identifying nodes under globally similar but locally slightly different shape of corridor environment for topological mapping and 2) obstacle avoidance navigation using cheap sensors. In order to detect nodes robustly, we define the eigenvalue ratio (EVR) which converts geometrical shape of the environment to a quantitative value based on the principal component analysis (PCA). This method is demonstrated by simulation and experiments to be robust, with the notable detail that at a given corridor intersection the method can detect a cluster of nodes defined in this manner. For safe obstacle avoidance navigation, we introduce circle following (CF) algorithm which uses geometry of environment and characteristics of sonar sensors. Experiments and simulation validate reliability of the CF algorithm",

Both structural strain energy and mechanical efficiency are shaped together through compromise programming method to develop a new combined formulation to meet the optimal design according to the demands of minimizing structural compliance and maximizing mechanical function specification. The artificial spring model is resorted to reveal the relationship between the work-piece and the compliant mechanism, and the dummy load method is used to further engrave the formulation pattern by superposition of two load cases. Displacement limitation and material usage are imposed as external constraints to narrow the design domain. A sequential convex programming using the approximations of the method of moving asymptotes (MMA) is applied to solve the optimization problem. SIMP interpolation scheme is used to indicate the dependence between the elastic modulus upon regularized element densities. Numerical examples have been applied to demonstrate the validation of the proposed methods",

        "abstract": "This paper presents a design concept of spherical actuators including a ball-shaped rotor with two layers of permanent-magnet (PM) poles and a spherical-shell-like stator with two layers of circumferential air-core coils. Corresponding to the poles configuration, the torque model of the spherical actuator has been derived. The magnetic field as well as torque output have been compared with that of spherical actuator with single-layer PM-pole configuration. This generic torque modeling method can be extended for spherical actuators with multi-layer PM&coil poles which can achieve high motion resolution as well as large working range",

        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "We have developed a new class of continuously flexible snake-like robots, called active cannulas, that consist of several telescoping pre-curved superelastic tubes. The devices derive bending actuation not from tendon wires or other external mechanisms, but from elastic energy stored in the backbone itself. This allows active cannulas to have a small diameter and a high degree of dexterity, which should enable them to navigate through complex anatomy to sites inaccessible by current surgical robotic devices. Active cannulas may also enhance patient safety because their inherent compliance mitigates potential trauma from inadvertent tool-tissue collision. A consequence of our design is that dexterity improves with miniaturization. A kinematic description of active cannula shape requires a model of the elastic interaction of telescoping pre-curved flexible tubes, and we derive a two-\"link\" beam mechanics-based model. Experiments using curved nitinol tubes and wires validate the model.",

Practical algorithms for solving these subproblems are currently not complete, offering resolution completeness or probabilistic completeness instead. While this lesser provision of completeness is acceptable in many cases, naively combining state-of-the-art approaches in motion planning and inverse kinematics can lead to a method that provides no measure of completeness. We present a probabilistically complete solution to the reaching problem for humanoid robots in static environments, and evaluate it against two other methods using a kinematically simulated humanoid in a virtual environment",

The robot considered, The Rocking and Rolling Robot (RRRobot), is a high-centered round-bodied robot that locomotes on a plane by swinging its legs and rocking on its shell. We identify the elements contributing to locomotion through two steps: 1) decoupling the leg-body rotation dynamics from the body-plane contact kinematics, and 2) decoupling the body rotational dynamics into dynamics along each rotational axis. We show, using simulation, that such decoupling provides a good approximation to RRRobot's locomotion and use these models to find an approximate control solution for RRRobot: a mapping between planar translation and leg motions",

Although the dominant approach, when using RL, has been to apply value function based algorithms, the system here detailed is characterized by the use of Direct Policy Search methods. Rather than approximating a value function, these methodologies approximate a policy using an independent function approximator with its own parameters, trying to maximize the future expected reward. The policy based algorithm presented in this paper is used for learning the internal state/action mapping of a behavior. In this preliminary work, we demonstrate its feasibility with simulated experiments using the underwater robot GARBI in a target reaching task.",

The method has been developed and implemented for multi-sensor systems, where sensor events can abruptly change desired target positions and trajectory constraints from one control cycle to another (i.e. maximum velocities, accelerations, and jerks). This work mainly presents a simple on-line second-order-trajectory generator and gives an outlook to a third-order-trajectory generator. Both algorithms generate time-optimal position progressions and require computational three steps: A. determination of the degree of freedom that requires the longest execution time, B. synchronization of all degrees of freedom by adapting maximum velocities and accelerations, C. calculation of new output values (position, velocity, and acceleration). Experimental results as well as a description of how to integrate this approach into manipulation control architectures are presented",

        "abstract": "Robot companions need to be able to constantly acquire knowledge about new objects for instance in order to detect them in the environment. This ability is necessary since it is hard to predict what objects the robot may face in the operation phase during development. This paper presents ideas and results on two topics. The first topic is on the design of an open-ended object detection system that uses scale invariant feature key-point descriptors that are trained with a one-class radial basis function support vector machine. Unlike using other classifier-based approaches our method does not assume the number classes to be known a priori. The method is shown to be stable against full 3D rotation of the object relative to the sensor. The second issue in this paper deals with a solution on how to provide new object information to the robot. A modern range imaging sensor in conjunction with a conventional color imaging sensor is used for a first figure-background separation. The experiments presented support the basic statements in this paper. Conclusions are drawn and future work is addressed",

        "abstract": "The main contribution of this paper is a novel stereo-based algorithm which serves as a tool to examine the viability of stereo vision solutions to the simultaneous localisation and mapping (SLAM) for large indoor environments. Using features extracted from the scale invariant feature transform (SIFT) and depth maps from a small vision system (SVS) stereo head, an extended Kalman filter (EKF) based SLAM algorithm, that allows the independent use of information relating to depth and bearing, is developed. By means of a map pruning strategy for managing the computational cost, it is demonstrated that statistically consistent location estimates can be generated for a small (6 m times 6 m) structured office environment, and in a robotics search and rescue arena of similar size. It is shown that in a larger office environment, the proposed algorithm generates location estimates which are topologically correct, but statistically inconsistent. A discussion on the possible reasons for the inconsistency is presented. The paper highlights that, despite recent advances, building accurate geometric maps of large environments with vision only sensing is still a challenging task",

        "abstract": "This paper discusses the whole arm manipulation allowing the contact state transition. For manipulation of an object under fully constrained, the contact state transition becomes necessary. In order to realize the object manipulation, we first derive the feasible direction of the object manipulation by analyzing the active/passive closure properties for every combination of contact states. Second, we derive the set of joint torque to move the object in the feasible direction. These analyses also provide the joint torque to realize the manipulation at the planned contact states. Effectiveness of the proposed method is confirmed by some simulation results",

        "abstract": "One ambitious goal in current robotics research is to build robots that can interact with humans in an intuitive way and can do so outside the lab in real world situations and environments such as private homes or public places. Toy robots like, e.g., Sony's AIBO are already being sold successfully for entertainment purposes, but they usually lack sophisticated human-like interaction capabilities preventing non-expert users to instruct them for useful tasks. We have developed a robot that is capable of processing multi-modal instructions and can, therefore, be instructed interactively in a social situation. This paper gives an overview of the components of the system and their integration. The system performance is described in detail based on observations from human-robot interactions and processing times to identify critical system components and further research directions. Finally, we report on first human-robot interactions with our robot BIRON (Bielefeld Robot companiON) being situated in a real home environment. These interactions demonstrate that our robot is able to interact with users in a real home environment and can thus serve as a basis for comprehensive user studies focussing on embodied interaction for social learning",

        "abstract": "Ostraciiform fish such as the boxfish are known for their ability to swim smoothly through turbulent waters of coral reefs and their excellent maneuverability. These characteristics are desirable in an micro underwater vehicle. Biologists have recently found that the boxfish's body shape generates self-correcting trimming forces by shedding counter rotating vortices to compensate for the instabilities in turbulent water. The purpose of this work is to study the effect of body shape on self-correcting vortex generation and use these results to design the outer body shape of a micro underwater vehicle mimicking a real boxfish. To this end, computer aided design and Engineering (CAD/CAE) tools such as solid modeling software and fluid flow simulation software were used for analysis and comparison of different body shapes. In this paper we present the numerical simulation results for two varieties of boxfish, namely the spotted boxfish the Buffalo trunkfish, and the results were used to derive key design guidelines for a suitable body shape that can exhibit the desired self-correcting mechanism. Based on the results an outer shape has been rapid prototyped in two halves that can be mounted on either side of the robot chassis",

Because the torque control strategy derived from sliding modes depends on the dynamics of mobile robots, the robustness of the system cannot be guaranteed due to the uncertainties of robot dynamics. In order to decrease the impact of the uncertainties and improve the robustness of the system, improved RBF neural networks are designed online to model the dynamics of mobile robot. Thus the torque controller based on sliding mode is composed of a neural network controller and a robust compensator.

This navigation is achieved using a partially observable Markov decision process (POMDP). In the localization phase we used WiFi signal strength and ultrasound measures as observations. The localization system works in two stages: map construction and localization stage. The map construction stage usually requires a great effort, therefore in this paper we address the problem of minimizing this calibration effort using an automatic training method. We describe the method based on simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) techniques and in a robust local navigation task. This automatic method is compared with a manual method to obtain a deterministic map. Also we demonstrate that using this one in a on-line training stage the system is able to adapt the WiFi map to the variations of the WiFi signal measure. Additionally, we analyze the optimal parameters for this automatic training system. The system has been tested in a real environment using two commercial robotic platforms. Some experimental results and the conclusions are presented",

There has been little work in trajectory generation for vehicles with all-wheel steering capability compared to the Ackermann, differential-drive, or omnidirectional mobility system models. The presented method linearizes and inverts forward models of propulsion, suspension, and motion to minimize boundary state error given a parameterized set of controls. Our method for generating efficient motion splines between a series of state boundary constraints optimizes the free path heading boundary constraint while meeting position and orientation state constraints. We demonstrate this algorithm on the Rocky 8 rover platform, where parameterized linear velocity, curvature, and path heading controls are generated which satisfy position, orientation, and path heading constraints in rough terrain",

        "abstract": "Much work on self-reconfigurable robotics has been focused on motion planning and physical reconfiguration of the robot. Using the Superbot self-reconfigurable robot, we focus on the details of realizing locomotion gaits given that a single robot topology can be realized in a large number of different ways. That is, each module in the robot topology has 4 symmetric orientations that are functional and shape equivalent. Once a role is selected for each module, such as through the use of hormone-inspired control, each module's role is supplied with a gait template which then must be transformed to suit the local configurations of each module with respect to the global topology. We provide a theoretical framework for which this can be accomplished",

Another advantage related to trim trajectories consists in the simplification of the development of the aerodynamic parameters estimation algorithms. To ensure trim feasibility, a set of constraint relating to the dynamic equations of the airship, actuator saturation and other type of constraints are taken into account",

Using three spherical cameras which are not aligned with a straight line the distance cue of points near the baseline of one pair of spherical images can be recovered from the other; thus, we can acquire the whole surrounding structure of environment by trinocular spherical stereo approach. In this paper we give the definition, algorithm and experimental results of trinocular spherical stereo",

This model has improved performance near cusp points and is shown to converge toward the optimal \"Reeds and Shepp\" paths under two conditions: 1) when the upper bound of the curvature derivative bound tends to infinity and 2) when the pause at the cusp is sufficient for the vehicle to completely re-orientate its steering before departing the cusp point. This motion model was applied to the general problem of turning a vehicle around between two parallel lines. This required the development of a specialised path planner and a method to search for near-time optimal solutions.",

        "abstract": "This paper deals with the motion of a multi-legged modular robot. The robot consists of six homogenous modules, each of which has a body and two legs and is connected to the others through a three-degree-of-freedom joint. The leg joints are manipulated to follow periodic desired trajectories, and the joints between the modules act like a passive spring with a damper. This robot has characteristic dynamic properties. Specifically, a straight walk naturally turns into a meandering walk by changing the compliance of the joints between the modules without incorporation of any oscillatory inputs. We first show that this transition is excited due to a Hopf bifurcation, based on a numerical simulation and Floquet analysis. Following that, we examine whether the maneuverability and agility increase by utilizing the dynamic characteristics inherent in the robot. In particular, we conduct an experiment in which the robot pursues a target moving across the floor. We propose a simple controller to accomplish the task and achieve high maneuverability and agility by making the most of the robot's dynamic features",

This work addresses the task in which a UAV is performing an inspection on a set of power lines and an emergency situation occurs requiring the UAV to avoid the lines and then find a safe landing area (a forced landing). This problem is approached using vision, where the vision system acts as the overall controller sending velocity commands to a low-level controller. The use of vision here allows the 2D position of the UAV to be updated by an image-based signal where the error to minimize is the location of a feature or set of features in the image. The system has been tested in a air vehicle simulator (AVS) - a cable array robot which allows to simulate and control three DOF (translation) of a UAV. Results obtained from tests in a scale scenario show the feasibility of this approach",

Next, physical and virtual spaces are merged by RFID tags. Through this, it is shown that ambient intelligence is realized and the space localization and mapping problem of robots can be more easily solved. Finally, the experiment based on an example scenario is carried out to verify the proposed method in the informative space named u-RT space which has two kinds of RFID tags, a virtual space with ubiquitous function services realized by Web services, and a networked robot system which works in these spaces",

        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "The goal of this paper is to develop an underwater robot with a buoyancy control system based on the spermaceti oil hypothesis. Sperm whales have a spermaceti organ in their head that is filled with spermaceti oil. Spermaceti oil is high quality oil and was used as material for candles, lubricant, and so on. There is a hypothesis about spermaceti oil that insists that sperm whales melt and congeal their spermaceti oil and change the volume of the oil to control their own buoyancy. This hypothesis appears suitable for the underwater robot because no materials for the ballast, such as sea water taken in at another place and iron, are discarded in the sea. To choose the best material as a spermaceti oil substitute, we measured the densities of four materials at both liquid and solid states, and calculated their buoyancy differences between both states. From the results, we concluded that the paraffin wax was the best material because its buoyancy difference is the largest of the four and its melting point is relatively low. Next, we directly measured the buoyancy of the paraffin wax and found that a particular arrangement of nichrome wire, which heats the oil, increases the level of buoyancy. Finally, we developed an underwater robot with a buoyancy control system based on this hypothesis. We measured its buoyancy and succeeded in surfacing of the robot in a small water tank",

        "abstract": "This paper presents a comprehensive unified control strategy for underactuated two-link manipulators, including acrobots and pendubots. The motion space is divided into two areas: swing-up and attractive; and control laws are designed for each. First, a control law based on a weak control Lyapunov function (WCLF) is employed to increase the energy and control the posture of the actuated link in the swing-up area. Next, one of the parameters of the WCLF is chosen to be a nonlinear function of the state so as to avoid any singularities. Then, another parameter in the control law is adjusted based on the state to improve the control performance. Stability is guaranteed in the swing-up area by the use of a WCLF based on the LaSalle invariant theorem. Finally, the global stability of the control system is guaranteed by the use of a non-smooth Lyapunov function integrated with a minimum-switching strategy. Simulation results for a pendubot and an acrobot show this control scheme to be very effective",

In manipulation of a linear object, its raveling must be avoided. It takes much time to unravel it once it is raveled. Therefore, it is important to generate unraveling plans efficiently. First, an unraveling process of a linear object is represented a sequence of crossing state transitions. It can be generated on a computer if 3D information about the current crossing state is given. Second, the crossing sequence of a linear object, which corresponds to its 2D information, is categorized into two types: unravelable and not-unravelable. Third, a procedure to generate efficient unraveling processes based on unravelability of the crossing sequence is explained. Finally, examples of unraveling process generation with our developed system are demonstrated",

        "abstract": "Learning tasks from human demonstration is a core feature for household service robots. To increase the utility of future robot servants, the robot should go beyond simply imitating the user's behavior but try to build flexible, extensible and general task knowledge. This requires higher level reasoning methods that allow the robot to consider its task knowledge in a holistic way. In order to cope with the vast datasets of task knowledge databases, these should be structured in a way that reflects the different classes of tasks as well as the specific characteristics of each task. As the complete set of tasks requested by the user can not be built into the robot, this structure should be learned from the database itself. In this paper, a system to record and interpret manipulation task demonstrations is presented. Unsupervised clustering methods on task knowledge are discussed that at the same time find the task class boundaries and the associated characteristics of each task class. These are used to group task demonstrations in the highly anisotropic feature space and to recognize similar demonstrations belonging to the same class of tasks. In each of the found task classes reasoning methods recover the sequential reordering possibilities, representing them in task precedence graphs. This equips the robot with the ability to update and improve its task knowledge without being put in a dedicated learning mode",

A HMM is also designed and trained for each movement class using the movement data. Humanoid movement is then generated by selecting the linear combination of basis elements that yields the highest probability for the trained HMM, subject to user-specified movement boundary conditions.

        "abstract": "We propose novel tools that reduce complexity and improve performances of visual detection and identification of known objects randomly located in complex cluttered environments. Generally, the propose mechanisms are based on local shape features (interest points, visual saliencies) detected in images and characterized by compact descriptors invariant to geometric and photometric transformations. In particular, a novel invariant for intensity changes is proposed, and the problem of over-exposed and under-exposed images is discussed. Both models of known objects and images of real scenes are represented using interest points, though in different scales (reference scale for models and relative scale for images). By matching interest point detected in images to interest points from the model database, known objects present in the scene can be detected and identified. The methodology can be used both for robot-mounted navigation modules and for distributed visual surveillance systems since the proposed mechanisms minimize the amount of visual data to be transmitted, thus preventing communicational saturation of such systems. In the paper, we focus on the image processing aspects of the problems. Image acquisition issues and high-level identification algorithms are only briefly mentioned",

The neural network is first trained based on sample data by using the 2D and 3D coordinates of some control points on a standard pattern. During the tracking stage, images captured by cameras are firstly changed into binary images. The curve is then thinned and its position on the image is recorded. From the image data, the curve's position in the world coordinate frame can be specified by using the trained neural network. The curve tracked can be arbitrary, open or closed.

The global layer conjectures and closes loops. We analyze the effect of different local trackers on the global layer. An interpretation tree (IPT) is compared to a new algorithm, orthogonal surface assignment (OSA), which attempts to track a building coordinate system. OSA is specialized to man-made work spaces. But our indoor experiments, performed with a rotating laser scanner, show clear advantages over the more general IPT: OSA covers the more relevant portion of the solution space, avoids the accumulation of rotation errors, and can estimate a unique translation in cases where IPT fails",

It is based on decomposition of the manipulator joint space into sets referred to as primitives which have redundancy one with respect to the attitude motion of the base body. The time duration of the manipulator motion is divided into sub-intervals. During a given sub-interval only one primitive is used. The choice of feasible sequence of primitives and times for their actuation, that satisfies given path constraints is made using mixed-variables optimization solver based on a mesh adaptive direct search algorithm",

As IPMC is a relatively new material, proper control methods have not yet evolved. In this paper the usability of IMPC actuators in real world applications is examined from the point of view of precision control. We propose a classical inverted pendulum control problem as a testbed. We suggest that if the pendulum can be balanced, then we have proven the usability of IPMC actuators for precise control tasks. In this paper we describe an inverted pendulum system driven by an IPMC actuator with PC-based control and a camera in the feedback loop. We report the preliminary experimental results in controlling the pendulum and discuss further improvements. To our knowledge this is the first attempt to control a system or manipulate an object with IMPC actuators in a feedback loop",

The hardware experiment was performed using an air-bearing supported docking testbed specially designed for testing different docking and capture mechanisms. Simulation model parameters were separately identified from the hardware. The simulation results compare favourably with the measured experimental data, which demonstrates the validity of the simulator and increases the confidence of using the simulator for design of various robotics-based satellite servicing missions such as the shuttle-return-to- flight, orbital express, and the potential hubble telescope robotic repair missions",

The purposed method copes with the dense traffic conditions: the free space required (first ten meters in front of the vehicle) is slightly equivalent to the security distance between two vehicles.

We previously proposed a proxy-based sliding mode control (PSMC) scheme, which is an extension of PID control that ensures slow, moderate, overdamped recovery from a large positional error at abnormal events without sacrificing tracking accuracy during normal operation. Its weakness is that the velocity is not bounded. This paper proposes a velocity-bounding PSMC (VB-PSMC) scheme, which is an extension of PSMC to impose an arbitrary magnitude limit on the velocity. The VB-PSMC method can be used as a lowest-level position servo that is safer than PSMC and much safer than conventional PID control. The advantage of VB-PSMC was demonstrated through implementation experiments",

        "abstract": "In outdoor environments, there is a variety of different types of ground surfaces. If some of them are slippery or bumpy, for example, the ground surface itself is a possible hazard for an autonomous mobile vehicle traversing the surface. Therefore, it is beneficial if the vehicle is able to estimate, which terrain it is currently traversing. Using this estimation, the vehicle can adapt its driving style to the terrain. In this paper, we present a method for terrain classification based on vibration induced in the vehicle's body. An accelerometer mounted on the vehicle measures the vibration perpendicular to the ground surface. We experimentally compare representations of the data based on the fast Fourier transform (FFT) and on the power spectral density (PSD). Additionally, we suggest a simpler and more compact representation based on features calculated from the raw data vectors and a combination of this representation with the PSD. We train and classify the data with a support vector machine (SVM). Experiments on a large real-world dataset containing seven different terrain types evaluate our approach",

A vision-based experiment system for automatically assembling capillaries to plastic microfluidic chips was set up. UN-curing adhesive is used for the joining procedure. Visual feedback is implemented in the assembly system and the control algorithm is briefly introduced. The methods for obtaining the spatial position deviation between the capillary and the end of the chip's micro channel are described. The deviation information in x-y plane is obtained by performing image processing and converting pixels into actual distance with calibrated data. Two methods for recovering vertical deviation information were explored, and both are feasible for application, one is the depth-in-focus, the other is with the use of microscopic stereovision",

        "abstract": "Manipulation and characterization of individual biological cells require cellular forces be precisely measured in real time. This paper presents a computer vision-based cellular force measurement platform that allows for the use a single vision sensor to simultaneously obtain two forms of feedback (i.e., vision and force). A novel silicone elastomer-based cell holding device and a sub-pixel visual tracking algorithm are developed. Deflections of elastic, low-stiffness structures are visually tracked, and material deflections are subsequently transformed into cellular forces. Experimental results demonstrate that the current vision-based force sensing system is capable of performing robust cellular force measurements at a full 30 Hz with a 3.7 muN resolution. Importantly, the vision-based cellular force sensing framework established in this study is not scale or cell line dependent. The device design, visual tracking algorithm, and experimental technique form a powerful framework that permits visually resolving cellular forces in real time with a picoNewton (26 pN) resolution for applications in single cell manipulation and characterization",

Our work is focused on the use of simple video cameras as the sensor devices. We describe a new machine learning approach to drivable surface detection that automatically combines a set of rectangular features and histogram backprojection based image segmentation algorithms to produce superior results. The machine learning algorithm is based on the AdaBoost method, one of a class of boosting techniques which are applicable to many image processing tasks such as object and face recognition or image segmentation. The algorithm is trained and tested on video data obtained from video cameras mounted on an autonomous tractor at our Queensland site. The algorithm approach, together with the simple feature-based weak classifiers used, produces significantly improved drivable surface detection results",

Here the URC means that it will provide the necessary services at any time and place to meet the user's requirements. Thus, it combines the network function with the current concept of a robot in order to enhance mobility and human interface. The vHRI components used in this video consist of caller identification, face recognition/verification, and gesture recognition. Firstly we perform face verification and recognition for the imposter and a member of family from face images of two users, respectively. After that, we use gesture recognition to provide the selection of TV channels under noise or long-distance environments. Finally, we demonstrate the usefulness through vision-based scenario shown from video. The robot platform used in this video is WEVER, which is a URC intelligent service robot developed at Intelligent Robot Research Division in Electronics and Telecommunication Research Institute (ETRI).",

The motion planning is based on a vision vector space (V2-Space), which is an unitary vector set that represents local collision-free directions in the image coordinate system, V2-Space is constructed by extracting the vectors based on the similarity of adjacent pixels, which captures both the color information and the directional information from prior vehicle tire tracks and pedestrian footsteps. We report how V2-Space is constructed to reduce the impact of varying lighting conditions in outdoor environments. We also show how V2 -Space can be used to incorporate vehicle kinematic, dynamic, and time-delay constraints in motion planning to fit the highly dynamic requirements of the motorcycle. The combined algorithm of the V2 -Space construction and the motion planning runs in O(n) time, where n is the number of pixels in the captured image. Experiments show that our algorithm outputs correct robot motion commands more than 90% of the time",

We present a strategy to automatically build online a consistent 3D representation from a set computer vision algorithms results. We especially focus on 2 important aspects: the constraints and choices of each parts of the system, as well as the global layout of these parts, and the final step where all information are merged together to build a unique 3D representation. Results on real scene and system performance are finally showed to validate the proposed approach",

        "track": "main",
        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "Current approaches to the visual homing for mobile robot navigation are generally inspired in insects' behavior and based on the observed angular information of fixed points of the environment (landmarks). They suppose the capacity for absolute orientation of the observations (compasses) and/or require the detection and identification of at least three landmarks; furthermore, they tend to generate homing paths with circumvolutions which reduce the efficiency of navigation. This document proposes a new approach to the visual homing navigation based on the observed angular information of only two landmarks, without any previous knowledge of their locations and real sizes or any compasses or range sensors. The route calculation towards the home point is accomplished systematically by means of triangulation/trilateration, considering the apparent size observed for each landmark and obtaining rectilinear navigation paths. The proposed visual homing navigation method has been simulated extensively in an obstacle-free and uncertainty-exempt environment, verifying its strength and efficiency in the navigation of short and long range with different scene configurations; it can be easily integrated with other navigation systems (e.g.: obstacle avoidance), and even be used to calculate the robot's relative location",

Object representation and a learning technique are two indispensable parts for this demanding task while arbitrary object appearance and diverse scenes with cluttered background are two great challenges. However, compared with object representation, the learning technique is less developed to deal with these challenges. This paper extends the multiple instance learning (MIL) technique to the multi-class classification scenario and introduces this multi-class MIL framework to the object recognition domain for the first time. This framework is independent of object representation and is useful for object/background discrimination in unseen scenes. Preliminary experiments show that it compares favorably with the supervised learning approach which takes whole images as the classifier training input",

The proposed SLAM algorithm uses an extended Kalman filter based framework to localize and reconstruct 3D line and corner landmarks at the same time and in real time. It provides more accurate localization and map building results than conventional corner feature only-based techniques. Moreover, the reconstructed 3D line landmarks enhance the performance of the robot relocation when robot's pose remains uncertain with corner information only. Experimental results show that the hybrid landmark based SLAM, using lines and corners, produces better performance than corner only one's",

        "abstract": "This paper discusses an approach to apply visual servoing to a 3D flexible-link manipulator. The proposed approach is composed of an end-effector position control based on eye-in-hand visual servoing and a vibration suppression control. In order to decouple the end-effector position control and the vibration control, the end-effector position control is applied in a low frequency domain, while the vibration control is applied in a high frequency domain. To decouple the frequency domain, a high-pass filter and a low-pass filter are used. Stability of the whole system is analyzed by investigating the pole of the system. Using the proposed approach, the 3D flexible-link manipulator succeeds to insert a peg into a hole whose clearance is 0.5 mm. However, it is difficult for the flexible-link manipulator to insert the peg into a hole whose clearance is 0.1 mm, if there is no force control. Therefore, an impedance control is also tested together with the end-effector position control and the vibration control. Using the modified approach, the flexible-link manipulator succeeds to insert the peg into the hole whose clearance is 0.1 mm",

To avoid collisions with the environment and occluded views, such platforms are often equipped with redundant degrees-of-freedom. The operator must manually coordinate multiple degrees-of-freedom in order to get desired views. Tracking moving targets becomes especially tedious and often requires several highly skilled operators. Visual servoing some degrees-of-freedom may reduce operator burden and improve tracking performance. This video showcases the results using such an approach.",

Most of the existing procedures use external localization devices to control the robot. However, these devices are not adequate for minimally invasive interventions such as laparoscopic surgery because this kind of surgery involves large lever effects which make high accuracy unreachable. In this paper, we propose a path following method based on the use of the endoscopic camera and instruments with markers. It mainly stands on an image-based visual servoing scheme and on the estimation of the 3D position of the incision point in the abdominal wall. We show that this method can lead to precise tracking despite the errors on the position of the incision point. The proposed method is finally demonstrated in vitro in an automatic suturing intervention.",

Additionally, different algorithms can be considered for a better handling of the particles depending of the context.

        "abstract": "The robotic system is developed to improve the effect of microsurgery for keratoplasty. The autonomous suturing should be qualified for the operational requirements of microsurgical keratoplasty. Poorly modeled mechanism of robotic micromanipulator and slight movements of surgical objective point are hindrance for precise position and orientation of end-needle. Visual servo control is available to overcome these obstacles. An appropriate scheme of robotic vision is proposed. On the basis of biological binocular vision, a feasible method of calibration and reconstruction for surgical microscope is adopted. The model parameters estimated by linear regression are evaluated for accuracy, stability and robustness. The visual servo control is applied for guiding robotic end-needle to reach the penetrating objective point. The visual servo control has look-and-move architecture based on image feature. The experimental results show that the robotic system for microsurgical keratoplasty can fulfil the surgical task of suturing penetration precisely",

Walking constraints in the previous resolved momentum control framework are reformulated to utilize motion-embedded CoM Jacobian and reduce computational complexity. In this method, the conventional linear momentum control is replaced by the explicit CoM manipulation and the angular momentum equation only is used for upper body motion resolution without any other subject variables; whole body cooperative motions are completed with the walking constraints expressed by motion-embedded CoM Jacobian. The conventional resolved momentum control is able to play a more unified framework role owing to this method and lose computational weight while making compatibility with the motion-embedded CoM Jacobian framework.

Based on this method, this paper mainly discusses generating stable and harmonious walking pattern by considering upper body motion, and planning hip trajectories in both sagittal plane and lateral plane. To reduce the iterative computation cost, some constraints of the relationship between sagittal hip motion and lateral hip motion are formulated, and only the trajectories satisfy these constraints are worked out. Finally, we determine the trajectory with a large stability margin from these generated trajectories. The effectiveness of the proposed method is confirmed by simulations and experiments with our developed humanoid robot BHR-02 with 32 DOF",

        "abstract": "In this paper we propose a robust control strategy for a gantry crane system with hoisting. The trolley moves horizontally to translate a load mass, hanging at the lower end of a cable, from rest to rest. Due to the flexibility of the cable, load swing easily arises, and should be controlled. To this end, the trolley motion and load hoisting are designed carefully. The desired trolley motion is decided in real time by a wave-based approach, which interprets the cable motion as two superposed traveling waves, to eliminate the load swing at the end of a manoeuvre. The load hoisting is chosen to reduce the load swing during the manoeuvre. A robust algorithm, based on a nonlinear model of the crane system, is proposed for the tracking control, allowing for system parameter variations and uncertainties. This control algorithm works very well and is stable and robust to large load variations. As demonstrated in the numerical simulations, it lands the load rapidly and exactly at target and stops it dead, with zero swing",

        "abstract": "Microscopy imaging can not achieve both high resolution and wide image space simultaneously. Autofocusing and 3-D surface reconstruction techniques are of fundamental importance to automated micromanipulation in providing high lever task understanding, task planning and real time control. In this paper, a new wavelet-based focus measure is developed, which provides significantly better depth resolution accuracy, and robustness than previous ones. A complex valued wavelet-based microscopic image fusion method and 3-D surface reconstruction scheme were proposed. Purpose of image fusion is to combine those multi-focus images into one single clear composite image with an extended depth-of-field. Combined 2-D position data of \"in focus\" pixels with a height map obtained from the proposed image fusion method, a 3-D surface reconstruction algorithm of microparts is developed. Experimental results validate the performances of the proposed image fusion and 3-D surface reconstruction methods",

        "abstract": "In this paper, a new considering approach for frictional constraint is proposed. It is pointed out that the conventional method only considering translational friction is not appropriate for biped walking, and the frictional rotation constraint should be taken into account. It is stressed that the translational motion and rotational motion will occur simultaneously when slip starts in biped walking, and the frictional rotation constraint plays a more important role than the frictional translation constraint. Furthermore, a method to calculate the slipping frictional force and torque, to predict the most possible slipping direction of a support foot in single support phase is developed. With this method, the quantitative compensation for the yaw-axis moment gets possible. Finally, a new frictional constraint rule applicable for any frictional motions is suggested",

This system employs a small robot which has similar form to a control target as an operating/displaying device, so that the device provides an operational feeling like manipulating a doll, so it is named Marionette device. Since the characteristics of the Marionette device and the target robot are synchronized bilaterally in the system, the operation of the Marionette device is reflected intuitively in the target, and the robot motion is also displayed simultaneously by the Marionette device. In this paper, we develop a humanoid type device as a Marionette device in order to operate a humanoid robot HRP-2 and implement a wholebody teleoperation method. The remote walking and manipulation experiments in an unknown environment are introduced. In this experiment, the operator should guess the remote environment using head camera view and control legs and arms by the Marionette device. We propose a new operation method for controlling the foot position and leg joints with the Marionette device. It makes possible to walk by pointing a foot stamp step by step in a stable place",

The workspace under study is defined as the set of all end-effector poses satisfying force-closure condition. Force-closure also means that the inverse dynamics problem of the manipulator has a feasible solution. Since there is no limitation on the external wrench and the dynamic motion of the end-effector, such a workspace is the most desirable (or nonrestricted) workspace for the intended application simulating low-speed impact-contact dynamics. A systematic method of determining whether or not a given end-effector's pose is inside the workspace is proposed with mathematical proof. Based on this method, the shape, boundary, dimensions, and volume of the workspace of a 6-DOF cable robot are displayed and discussed",

        "abstract": "Workspace analysis and optimization is a critical issue in robot manipulator design. For a cable-driven parallel manipulator (CDPM), due to the unilateral driving properties of the cables, maintaining positive cable tension is essential to maneuver the moving platform. As a result, its workspaces are always determined and characterized by the tension status of its driving cables. It has been realized that the tension factor (TF) reflecting the relative tension distribution among the driving cables is an appropriate measure to evaluate the quality of force closure for CDPMs. However, in a fully restrained CDPM, since redundant cables are employed to drive the moving platform, the TF values are not unique even for a particular moving platform pose. Therefore, how to obtain the optimal TF value so as to generate an optimized workspace becomes the major subject of this paper. It is proved that the optimal TF value can be efficiently determined through a linear optimization approach, although it is essentially a nonlinear optimization problem. Subsequently, a global tension index is proposed to evaluate the quality of the entire workspace, which is achieved by integrating the local TF values (i.e., the optimal TF values at every moving platform poses) over the workspace. Computation examples are provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms",

        "track": "main",
        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "This paper introduces the Extensible Agent Behavior Specification Language (XABSL) as a pragmatic tool for engineering the behavior of autonomous agents in complex and dynamic environments. It is based on hierarchies of finite state machines (FSM) for action selection and supports the design of longterm and deliberative decision processes as well as of short-term and reactive behaviors. A platform-independent execution engine makes the language applicable on any robotic platform and together with a variety of visualization, editing and debugging tools, XABSL is a convenient and powerful system for the development of complex behaviors. The complete source code can be freely downloaded from the XABSL website (http://www.informatik.huberlin.de/ki/XABSL/). The language has been successfully applied on many robotic platforms, mainly in the domain of RoboCup robot soccer. It gave the GermanTeam the crucial advantage over other teams to become the 2004 and 2005 world champion in the four-legged league and helped the team CoPS Stuttgart to become third in the Middle Size League in 2004",

        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "This paper presents a novel navigation approach which, with minimal requirements in terms of on-board sensory, memory, and computational power, exhibits way-finding behaviors in very complex environments. The algorithm does not require any internal spatial representation, nor self-localization abilities: however, since it relies on heuristics to find a path to the goal, completeness is not guaranteed. The paper shows that this is the price to pay for augmenting the robustness of the system in presence of incomplete information and measurement noise",
