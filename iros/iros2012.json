For that purpose it is needed to measure different biometric parameters from the user and additionally measure the interaction between endovascular instruments and vasculature models membrane. For that purpose in this research we present an optical sensor for encoding linear and rotational motion of the catheter through the insertion port. Additionally we present two studies for measuring tissue integrity, time to complete a task, reaction time, and wasting motion using two populations of expert and beginner. The optical encoder showed an average error of 0.39mm and 10.78deg. In both studies the presented cyber-physical system is useful to identify the users with qualities closer to the expert among users with low performance.",

        "abstract": "In this paper a new PCA-based positioning sensor and localization system for mobile robots to operate in unstructured environments (e.g. industry, services, domestic\u2026) is proposed and experimentally validated. The inexpensive positioning system resorts to principal component analysis (PCA) of images acquired by a video camera installed onboard, looking upwards to the ceiling. This solution has the advantage of avoiding the need of selecting and extracting features. The principal components of the acquired images are compared with previously registered images, stored in a reduced onboard image database, and the position measured is fused with odometry data. The optimal estimates of position and slippage are provided by Kalman filters, with global stable error dynamics. The experimental validation reported in this work focuses on the results of a set of experiments carried out in a real environment, where the robot travels along a lawn-mower trajectory. A small position error estimate with bounded co-variance was always observed, for arbitrarily long experiments, and slippage was estimated accurately in real time.",

        "abstract": "A wide range of robotic systems needs to estimate their rotation for diverse tasks like automatic control and stabilization, among many others. In regards of the limitations of traditional navigation equipments (like GPS and inertial sensors), this paper follows a vision approach based on the observation of vanishing points (VPs). Urban environments (outdoor as well as indoor) generally contain orthogonal VPs which constitutes an important constraint to fulfill in order to correctly acquire the structure of the scenes. In contrast to existing VP-based techniques, our method inherently enforces the orthogonality of the VPs by directly incorporating the orthogonality constraint into the model estimation step of the RANSAC procedure, which allows real-time applications. The model is estimated from only 3 lines, which corresponds to the theoretical minimal sampling for rotation estimation and constitutes our 3-line RANSAC. We also propose a 1-line RANSAC when the horizon plane is known. Our algorithm has been validated successfully on challenging real datasets.",

        "abstract": "In this paper, we present an object pose estimation algorithm exploiting both depth and color information. While many approaches assume that a target region is cleanly segmented from background, our approach does not rely on that assumption, and thus it can estimate pose of a target object in heavy clutter. Recently, an oriented point pair feature was introduced as a low dimensional description of object surfaces. The feature has been employed in a voting scheme to find a set of possible 3D rigid transformations between object model and test scene features. While several approaches using the pair features require an accurate 3D CAD model as training data, our approach only relies on several scanned views of a target object, and hence it is straightforward to learn new objects. In addition, we argue that exploiting color information significantly enhances the performance of the voting process in terms of both time and accuracy. To exploit the color information, we define a color point pair feature, which is employed in a voting scheme for more effective pose estimation. We show extensive quantitative results of comparative experiments between our approach and a state-of-the-art.",

Our detection and tracking schemes are coherently integrated in a particle filtering framework on the special Euclidean group, SE(3), in which the visual tracking problem is tackled by maintaining multiple hypotheses of the object pose. For textureless object detection, an efficient chamfer matching is employed so that a set of coarse pose hypotheses is estimated from the matching between 2D edge templates of an object and a query image. Particles are then initialized from the coarse pose hypotheses by randomly drawing based on costs of the matching. To ensure the initialized particles are at or close to the global optimum, an annealing process is performed after the initialization. While a standard edge-based tracking is employed after the annealed initialization, we employ a refinement process to establish improved correspondences between projected edge points from the object model and edge points from an input image. Comparative results for several image sequences with clutter are shown to validate the effectiveness of our approach.",

For a textureless object like a mechanical part, conventional visual feature matching usually fails due to the absence of rich texture features. Hierarchical template matching assumes that few templates can cover all object appearances. However, the appearance of a shiny object largely depends on its pose and illumination.

In this work, we propose a systematic approach to guarantee the satisfaction of virtual workspace constraints in 6D for arbitrary manipulator dynamics based on an extended invariance control concept. Invariance control yields a computationally efficient method to render multiple virtual nonlinear workspace boundaries. In order to make the scheme suitable for pHRI we present an approach to reduce chattering by explicitly considering the discrete-time Euler solver output. Orientation constraints are unambiguously represented as unit quaternions. The theoretical results are successfully validated in simulation and experiments on a 7-DoF anthropomorphic manipulator.",

        "abstract": "Finding paths in difficult regions of C-space, such as narrow passages and configuration obstacle boundaries, is a rather challenging problem for path planning in changing environments. When obstacles move in W-space, these regions in C-space will change their edge points from free to collision or on the contrary, for which a \u201cCapacitor\u201d Bridge Builder (CBB) is proposed in this paper to identify their changing characteristics. Specifically, a \u201cCapacitor\u201d bridge is built between positive and negative toggled points in C-Space, which looks like capacitors stuck between narrow passages or boundary regions. Through CBB, the back boundary of an obstacle, which is less likely to be occupied immediately, is marked as a temporary safe region. Furthermore, a Half Bridge Strategy (HBS) is novelly proposed to boost samples inside these regions. Eventually, highly safe paths are revealed by predicting moving directions of obstacles, then replanning times and total planning times will be decreased significantly. Effectiveness of the proposed method has been verified by experiments with two manipulators in difficult changing environments.",

        "abstract": "Mobility through balancing on spherical wheels has recently received some attention in the robotics literature. Unlike traditional wheeled platforms, the operation of such platforms depends heavily on understanding and working with system dynamics, which have so far been approximated with simple planar models and their decoupled extension to three dimensions. Unfortunately, such models cannot capture inherently spatial aspects of motion such as yaw motion arising from the wheel rolling motion or coupled inertial effects for fast maneuvers. In this paper, we describe a novel, fully-coupled 3D model for such spherical wheeled platforms and show that it not only captures relevant spatial aspects of motion, but also provides a basis for controllers better informed by system dynamics. We focus our evaluations to simulations with this model and use circular paths to reveal advantages of this model in dynamically rich situations.",

Literature suggests that this problem can be solved by reconstructing the subject's joint motion using one of the numerous models available, and then feeding the exoskeleton with the joint trajectories. This is founded on the assumption that the exoskeleton kinematics reproduces the human kinematics. In practice, though, mismatches are unavoidable and lead to inaccuracies. We thus developed a method that is primarily based on an appropriate mechanical design: passive mechanisms are used to connect the exoskeleton with splints wore by the subject, in such a way that, within the workspace, there always exists a posture of the exoskeleton compatible with a given position and orientation of the splints. The trajectory computing method, by itself, consists of recording the position and orientation of the splints thanks to a conventional 3D motion tracker and to exploit standard robotics tools in order to compute an exoskeleton posture compatible with the measured human posture. Conclusive experimental results involving an existing 4 DoF upper-limb exoskeleton are shown.",

We recorded a large set of image sequences from a Microsoft Kinect with highly accurate and time-synchronized ground truth camera poses from a motion capture system. The sequences contain both the color and depth images in full sensor resolution (640 \u00d7 480) at video frame rate (30 Hz). The ground-truth trajectory was obtained from a motion-capture system with eight high-speed tracking cameras (100 Hz). The dataset consists of 39 sequences that were recorded in an office environment and an industrial hall. The dataset covers a large variety of scenes and camera motions. We provide sequences for debugging with slow motions as well as longer trajectories with and without loop closures. Most sequences were recorded from a handheld Kinect with unconstrained 6-DOF motions but we also provide sequences from a Kinect mounted on a Pioneer 3 robot that was manually navigated through a cluttered indoor environment. To stimulate the comparison of different approaches, we provide automatic evaluation tools both for the evaluation of drift of visual odometry systems and the global pose error of SLAM systems. The benchmark website [1] contains all data, detailed descriptions of the scenes, specifications of the data formats, sample code, and evaluation tools.",

        "abstract": "Morphogenesis is the biological process in which a fertilized cell divides, cells migrate and interact with each other, and finally resulting in the mature body plan under the control of gene regulatory networks (GRNs). Recently, biological discovered that 85% of the gene-gene regulation networks are composed of frequently recurring network patterns, which are called network motifs. Inspired by these biological studies, in this paper, we propose a developmental approach, i.e., network motifs based gene regulatory network model (NM-GRN), for self-organization of swarm robots to autonomously generate dynamic patterns to adapt to uncertain environments. First, a general GRN model is proposed with several predefined network motifs as basic building blocks, then an evolutionary algorithm is applied to evolve parameters and the structures of the NM-GRN model based on these basic building blocks. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed bio-inspired model is effective for complex shape generation and robust to environmental changes in complex environments.",

We represent desired paths as geodesics with respect to a cost function that is defined so that each path-homotopy class contains exactly one (local) geodesic. We apply max-margin structured learning to recover a cost function that is consistent with observations of human walking paths. We derive an optimal feedback communication protocol to select a local geodesic\u2014equivalently, a path-homotopy class\u2014using a sequence of noisy bits. We validate our approach with experiments that quantify both how well our learned cost function characterizes human walking data and how well human subjects perform with the resulting interface in navigating a simulated robot with EEG.",

The present work is based on the premise that future advances in rehabilitation robotics require an enhanced understanding of the neural processes involved in motor learning after stroke. We present a system that combines a Barret WAM\u2122seven degree-of-freedom robot arm with neurophysiological recordings for the purpose of studying post-stroke motor learning. We used this system to conduct a pilot study on motor learning during reaching movements with two stroke patients. Preliminary results indicate that pre-trial brain activity in ipsilesional sensorimotor areas may be a neural correlate of the current state of motor learning. These results are discussed in terms of their relevance for future rehabilitation strategies that combine rehabilitation robotics with real-time analyses of neuro-physiological recordings.",

        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "Interest in telepresence robots is at an all time high, and several companies are already commercializing early or basic versions. There seems to be a huge potential for their use in professional applications, where they can help address some of the challenges companies have found in integrating a geographically distributed work force. However, teleoperation of these robots is typically a difficult task. This difficulty can be attributed to limitations on the information provided to the operator and to communication delay and failures. This may compromise the safety of the people and of the robot during its navigation through the environment. Most commercial systems currently control this risk by reducing size and weight of their robots. Research effort in addressing this problem is generally based on \u201cassisted driving\u201d, which typically adds a \u201ccollision avoidance\u201d layer, limiting or avoiding movements that would lead to a collision. In this article, we bring assisted driving to a new level, by introducing concepts from collaborative driving to telepresence robots. More specifically, we use the input from the operator as a general guidance to the target direction, then couple that with a variable degree of autonomy to the robot, depending on the task and the environment. Previous work has shown collision avoidance makes operation easier and reduce the number of collisions. In addition (and in contrast to traditional collision avoidance systems), our approach also reduces the time required to complete a circuit, making navigation easier, safer, and faster. The methodology was evaluated through a controlled user study (N=18). Results show that the use of the proposed collaborative control helped reduce the number of collisions (none in most cases) and also decreased the time to complete the designated task.",

The system attached to the needle is composed by a small screen that gives hints about the position and the orientation, a controller that commands the screen and interfaces with the computer, and a marker that communicates with a tracking system. By using a real time software the user is guided to move the needle along the desired position and orientation. To the best of our knowledges, this is the first system to have the navigation display integrated directly on the tool. The in-vitro tests we have performed, show how such a system yields a higher precision in the execution of the task and a reduction of the time required to complete the procedure.",

We investigate the approaches' requirements, advantages, and disadvantages under realistic conditions of error in robot localization, navigation, and sensing in simulation. Our results show that the deterministic approach, which requires region-based robot navigation, yields higher task progress in all cases. For robots without such navigation capabilities, the stochastic approach is a feasible alternative, and its resulting task progress is less sensitive to error in localization, error in navigation, and a combination of high error in localization, navigation, and sensing.",

An advantage of the framework is that it allows the macroscopic shape of a snake robot to be controlled explicitly and intuitively. The framework is based on specifying the desired shape of the snake robot as a continuous shape curve defined by a set of shape control points interconnected by B\u00e9zier curves. We propose a novel approach for motion generation in which the shape curve is repeatedly extended according to a desired gait pattern while a virtual snake robot is progressed along the shape curve to retrieve joint reference angles for the physical snake robot. Practical applications of the proposed control framework are exemplified along with simulation results.",

        "abstract": "This paper demonstrates that 2D pose SLAM has an underlining near convex structure when formulated as a least squares (LS) optimization problem. By introducing new variables and some approximations, the LS pose SLAM problem can be formulated as a quadratically constrained quadratic programming (QCQP) problem. The QCQP formulation can then be relaxed into a semi-definite programming (SDP) problem which is convex. Unique solution to the convex SDP problem can be obtained without initial state estimate and can be used to construct a candidate solution to the original LS pose SLAM problem. Simulation datasets and the Intel Research Lab dataset have been used to demonstrate that when the relative pose information contain noises with reasonable level, the candidate solution obtained through the relaxation is very close to the optimal solution to the LS SLAM problem. Thus in practice, the candidate solution can serve as either an approximate solution or a good initial guess for a local optimization algorithm to obtain the optimal solution to the LS pose SLAM problem.",

        "abstract": "In this paper, we propose a cost-aware path planning algorithm for mobile robots. As a robot moves from one location to another, the robot is penalized by the cost at its current location. The overall cost of the robot is determined by the trajectory of the robot over the cost map. The goal of the proposed cost-aware path planning algorithm is to find the trajectory with the minimal cost. The cost map of a field can represent environmental parameters, such as temperature, humidity, chemical concentration, wireless signal strength, and stealthiness. For example, if the cost map represents packet drop rates at different locations, the minimum cost path between two locations is the path with the best possible communication, which is desirable when a robot operates under the environment with weak wireless signals. The proposed cost-aware path planning algorithm extends the rapidly-exploring random tree (RRT) algorithm by applying the cross entropy (CE) method for extending motion segments. We show that the proposed algorithm finds a path which is close to the near-optimal cost path and gives an outstanding performance compared to RRT and CE-based path planning methods through extensive simulation.",

        "abstract": "For the development of artificial intelligent diagnosis for cerebrovascular intervention, it is desirable to forecast the growth of cerebral aneurysms. In order to achieve such purpose, it is needed to evaluate wall shear stress, strain, pressure, deformation and flow velocity in the aneurysm region. In this research, we focus on in-vitro strain and deformation measurements of cerebral aneurysm models, and propose a cyber-physical system, in which a scaled-up membranous silicone model of cerebral aneurysm was built and integrated with a specialized pump for the pulsatile blood flow simulation, and a vision system was constructed to measure the strain on different regions on the model with pulsatile blood flow circulated inside. Experimental results show that both distance and area strain maxima were larger for the aneurysm neck (0.042 and 0.052), followed by the aneurysm dome (0.023 and 0.04) and then by the main blood vessel section (0.01 and 0.014), which were complemented with computer fluid dynamics simulation for the inclusion of wall shear stress, oscillatory shear index and aneurysm formation index. Medical imaging data of the cerebral aneurysm in 2008 and 2011 was obtained. Diagnosis results have concordance with the aneurysm growth in 2011. The presented measurement method offers an option for measuring strain and deformation to be complementary with computer fluid dynamics and photoelastic stress analysis for advanced diagnostic in the endovascular surgery.",

While robots have not found a living survivor, possibly because they arrive on average 4.5 days after the event, the video clips illustrate the contributions of robots to searching for survivors, reconnaissance and mapping, inspection of buildings, and inspection of bridges and shipping channels. The clips also highlight four open research questions: human-robot interaction, mobile manipulation, reliable wireless networks, and obstacle avoidance for UAVs and UMVs. Use of robots is accelerating and their contributions to disaster prevention, preparedness, response, and recovery will grow and lead to new challenges for research.",

        "abstract": "The place recognition module is a fundamental component in SLAM systems, as incorrect loop closures may result in severe errors in trajectory estimation. In the case of appearance-based methods the bag-of-words approach is typically employed for recognizing locations. This paper introduces a novel algorithm for improving loop closures detection performance by adopting a set of visual words weights, learned offline accordingly to a discriminative criterion. The proposed weights learning approach, based on the large margin paradigm, can be used for generic similarity functions and relies on an efficient online leaning algorithm in the training phase. As the computed weights are usually very sparse, a gain in terms of computational cost at recognition time is also obtained. Our experiments, conducted on publicly available datasets, demonstrate that the discriminative weights lead to loop closures detection results that are more accurate than the traditional bag-of-words method and that our place recognition approach is competitive with state-of-the-art methods.",

        "abstract": "We present a flexible system that can scan and localize workpieces in 3D for assembly and pick and place operations. The system contains a vision robot that acquires 3D point clouds by performing sweeps with a laser triangulation sensor. Because the sensor is mounted on a robot, we can choose a viewpoint and a scanner trajectory that is optimal for a given task. For example, we can sweep along a semicircular trajectory in order to recognize and grasp parts from a pallet. With the same vision robot, we can perform a sweep of the packaging container in order to recognize and manipulate elements of cardboard. The system also incorporates software that recognizes and localizes objects based on an acquired 3D point cloud and a CAD model of the object to search for. The core matching algorithm is based on oriented point pairs and a Hough-like voting scheme. The method has been improved with a robust clustering algorithm as well as methods for pose verification and pose refinement that significantly increase the accuracy and robustness of the system. As an application of the system, an industrial prototype workcell is presented. The task is to recognize, grasp and transfer parts of office chairs, such as seats, seat backs and armrests, from a pallet to a cardboard container. It demonstrates how the vision system is easily set up to recognize three different components by using CAD models. The prototype workcell further demonstrates how the pose estimation results can be fed directly to a separate handling robot in order to grasp a chair seat. A series of ten experiments was performed where the chair seat was placed in arbitrary poses in the pallet. Pose estimations were performed in just over one second per experiment, and the obtained accuracy was well within the tolerances for the grasp operation in all ten cases.",

        "abstract": "Robotically assisted catheterisation has attracted significant interest in recent years. However, few designs have made full use of the extensive experience and skills that interventional radiologists have acquired from conventional catheter navigation. Additionally, limited research has been conducted in quantifying the effectiveness of haptic feedback for catheterisation procedures. This paper presents a novel master-slave force feedback system for endovascular catheterisation that can be used in a natural setting with enhanced ergonomics. The system has been validated with detailed laboratory experiments and a comprehensive user study. The performance of the system was compared against manual catheterisation by measuring the forces exerted on a vascular phantom. The results showed a 76% reduction in the mean force applied and a 55% reduction in the maximum force over the course of the study, indicating that the force feedback system reduced the magnitude and duration of force exerted during a simulated endovascular procedure. This research provides important insights into the design of compact and ergonomic robotic catheter manipulators incorporating effective real-time force feedback for intraoperative navigation.",

        "abstract": "Networked robotics is an area that integrates multi-robot and network technology. The characteristics and the reliability of the communication environment play a fundamental role shaping and affecting behavior and performance of a mobile multi-robot system. In this context, two basic questions arise: how much the overall performance is affected and how can we investigate this influence? Addressing these two questions, in this paper we present the architecture of an integrated simulation environment that allows for realistic simulation of networked robotic systems. The proposed framework integrates two simulators: a network simulator and a multi-robot simulator. We present two implementations based on the ARGoS simulator for the robotic side, and with ns-2 and ns-3 employed as network simulators. We evaluate the proposed tools, both in isolation and integration, and show that they are able to efficiently simulate systems consisting of hundreds of robots. Moreover, we use the proposed framework to demonstrate the effects of communication on the performance of a mobile multi-robot system performing distributed coordination and task assignment. We compare realistic network simulation with simplified communication models and we study the resulting behavior and performance of the robotic system.",

Given a motion planning problem, choosing the appropriate algorithm to use is a daunting task even for experts since there has been relatively little effort in comparing the plans generated by the different approaches, for different problems. In this paper, we present a set of benchmarks and the associated infrastructure for comparing different types of motion planning approaches and algorithms. The benchmarks are specifically designed for robotics and include typical indoor human environments. We present example motion planning problems for single arm tasks. Our infrastructure is designed to be easily extensible to allow for the addition of new planning approaches, new robots, new environments and new metrics. We present results comparing the performance of several motion planning algorithms to validate the use of these benchmarks.",

This miniaturization usually refers to the actuators, the kinematics and the sensors, but also the control electronics and their computational resources are affected. Facing these restrictions, the present article discusses patterns of robot control software that can be transferred from architectures proposed previously to microcontroller platforms. It is proposed to organize the software components according to two aspects: timing context and organizational context. Results from a case study are reported, where the architecture was implemented for a parallel kinematic five-bar robot. This study concludes that the underlying patterns help to implement control software of miniaturized robots in handling and assembly efficiently, even if hardware resources are limited.",

The approach, close to structured light systems, uses the geometrical information obtained by the projection of a laser circle onto the ground plane and perceived by the camera. We propose some experiments based on simulated data and real sequences. The results show good agreement with the ground truth values from the commercial sensors in terms of its accuracy and correctness. The results also prove its suitability for autonomous take-off and landing as well as for the case of low altitude manoeuvre in dark, GPS signal deficient unknown environments with no prebuilt map. It also provides room for additional payload to be used for different applications due to it being inexpensive and use of light weight micro-camera and laser system.",

        "abstract": "Grousers, sometimes called lugs, are recognized as a way to improve wheel performance and traction, but there have been, to date, no comprehensive guidelines for choosing grouser patterns. This work presents a quantitative expression for determining appropriate grouser spacing for rigid wheels. Past empirical studies have shown that increasing grouser height and number can improve performance, to a point. The newly proposed grouser spacing equation is based on observations that wheels with an inadequate number of grousers induce forward soil flow ahead of the wheel, and thus rolling resistance. The equation relates geometric wheel parameters (wheel radius, grouser height and spacing) and operating parameters (slip and sinkage), and predicts a maximum allowable grouser spacing (or, equivalently, a minimum number of grousers). Experiments with various grouser heights and numbers demonstrate good correspondence to the proposed equation, as increases in number of grousers beyond the predicted minimum number stop improving performance. A grouser spacing equation is particularly useful for designing efficient wheels. The proposed relation includes slip and sinkage, parameters that cannot be assumed constant or known a priori, but this work shows that wheels designed using the proposed equation are robust to changing operating scenarios even if they degrade beyond estimated nominal conditions.",

The proposed instrument incorporates adaptive force sensing and actuation, allowing improved image consistency and force control, thus minimizing tissue deformation and induced micro-structural variations. The performance and accuracy of the contact force control are evaluated in detailed laboratory settings and in vivo validation of the device during transanal microsurgery in a live porcine model further demonstrates the potential clinical value of the device.",

        "abstract": "We present an original method for independent motion detection in dynamic scenes. The algorithm is designed for robotics real-time applications and it overcomes the short-comings of current approaches for the egomotion estimation in presence of many outliers, occlusions and cluttered background. The method relies on a stereo system which performs the reprojection of a sparse set of features following the camera displacement. We assume that noisy prior knowledge of the motion is available (i.e. a robot's kinematic model). Since this estimation leads to a heteroscedastic regression problem due to input-dependent noise, we employ a simple, but computationally efficient approach in order to accurately determine the latent egomotion subspace spanned by the Degrees of Freedom (DOFs) of the robot. The algorithm has been implemented and validated on the iCub humanoid robot. Qualitative and quantitative experiments are presented to show the effectiveness of the proposed approach. The contribution of the paper is a modular framework for independent motion detection naturally extendable to any architecture featuring a visual sensor that can be directly controllable.",

However, there are few CCPG models are constructed to generate the snake-like robot's three-dimensional gaits, which are important for adapation, and their gaits generation ability is also very inadequate. According to the CPG mechanism, a hierarchical CCPG model (HCCPG) with small complexity is proposed to implement the three-dimensional gaits better. The HCCPG has a two-layers structure, namely the basic rhythmic signal generation layer and the output signal modulation layer. The HCCPG can generate three-dimensional gaits well and is extendable. Based on the HCCPG, a three-dimensional gait control method is proposed. The simulations and experiments validate this method.",

        "abstract": "This paper considers the problem of stochastic motion planning in uncertain environments, and extends existing chance constrained optimal control solutions. Due to the imperfect knowledge of the system state caused by motion uncertainty, sensor noise and environment uncertainty, the system constraints cannot be guaranteed to be satisfied and consequently must be considered probabilistically. To account for the uncertainty, the constraints are formulated as convex constraints on a random variable, known as chance constraints, with the violation probability of all the constraints guaranteed to be below a threshold. Standard chance constrained stochastic motion planning methods do not incorporate environmental sensing which typically leads to overly-conservative solutions. To address this, a novel hierarchical framework is proposed that consists of two main steps: an expected shortest path problem on an uncertain graph and a chance constrained motion planning problem. The first successful, real-time experimental demonstration of chance constrained control with uncertain constraint parameters and variables is also presented for a quadrotor equipped with a Kinect sensor navigating through an uncertain, cluttered 3D environment.",

We can extract the pose information from the pattern by image processing using a single camera. The developed marker and the processing algorithm enable high-accuracy pose estimation even by observation from frontal direction. We verified its superiority to the conventional method by some validation tests. The marker is an extension of a marker we previously developed, and is more easily fabricated.",

We provide an analysis using wind tunnel experiments and a dynamic model. We demonstrate stable vertical takeoff, and using a marker-based external camera tracking system, hovering altitude control in an active feedback loop.

Due to the realtime constraint, some inaccuracies in the simulation are tolerated. It is found that the present method captures some key aspects of fluid flow that are important to flying small aircraft near environmental obstacles, but a simplified treatment of boundary conditions leads to incomplete development of vortices at the fluid-solid boundary.",

        "abstract": "The Tactical Movement Problem seeks to determine the minimum cost mission for a robotic agent tasked to complete an assignment that involves both moving through its environment and manipulating that environment. The problem arises in several contexts including open-pit mining automation when a robotic excavator is tasked to remove a designated area of material. The work involves the excavator progressively digging earth, which is usually loaded to trucks. After each load cycle, a decision about from where to take the next dig must be made. Periodically this involves moving the excavator to a new location. The objective is to complete the task in minimum time or at a minimum energy cost or some similarly motivated cost function. The problem becomes one of determining the optimal path that the excavator should take and the dig operations that should be completed at each point along the path. In this paper the problem is posed as a linear relaxation that is solved successively to near optimality. Simulated results show that cost effective paths can be generated however there is still significant computation burden due to the high complexity of the problem. This result allows the solution of much larger task planning problems than were previously possible, thus moving towards the goal of cost effective automated excavation.",

        "abstract": "The same as in traditional surgery, surgeons in telerobotic surgery need extensive training to achieve experience and highly accurate instrument manipulation. Traditional training methods like practice in operating room have major drawbacks such as high risk and limited opportunity for which virtual reality (VR) and computer technologies can offer solutions. To accelerate the data transmission speed in our master-slave robotic simulator, GPUDirect was applied to ensure the synchronization and display rate of three computers. By using GPUDirect with InfiniBand card we realized up to 247% performance improvement in data transmission speed on NVIDIA Tesla\u2122 products on different computers compared to that without GPUDirect, which shows that GPUDirect enables better communication between remote GPUs over InfiniBand.",

        "abstract": "Here we present an example of a novel bio-inspired active vision system with a vibrating eye that can rotate freely by means of a miniature rotary piezo motor. Active micro-vibrations were applied to the eye by using an innovative micro-mechanism based on a tiny stepper motor. The hyperacuity of this inexpensive position-sensing device, which results from the active micro-vibrations, makes it capable of measuring the angular position of a contrasting edge. Among the many miniature rotary actuators available, piezomotors are often used when small size, low mass, great accuracy and high dynamics are required. The newly off-the-shelf miniature ultrasonic piezomotor presented in this study along with its position servo control system is supplied ready-integrated into a printed circuit board (PCB). The PCB Piezomotor (or PCBMotor) has many advantages, such as high torque (it requires no reducer), fast dynamics (the mechanical time constant is 3ms), a low mass (1gram) and a compact size (it is only 20mm in diameter and 2.6mm thick). The results of the tests conducted show that the performances of the PCBmotor connected to a custom-made miniature electronic driver make it a good alternative to the actuators classically used in robotic applications. In addition we present a simple visual processing, implemented onto a tiny microcontroller, composed of simple linear filtering and arithmetic operations. We show that our visual scanning sensor is a genuine position sensing device able to measure the relative angular position of a visual object with only two pixels and very few computational resources.",

Meaningful object confidences help to reduce false alarm rates of safety systems and improve the downstream system performance for modules such as sensor fusion and situation analysis. Several cues from stereo vision and from the tracking process are fused in a Bayesian manner. An evaluation on a 38,000 frames urban drive shows the effectiveness of the approach compared to the same object tracking scheme with simple heuristics for the object confidence. Within the evaluation, also the relevance of occurring phantoms is considered by computing the collision risk. The proposed confidence measures reduce the number of predicted imminent collisions from 86 to 0 maintaining almost the same system availability.",

With this configuration, a robot can perform planar legged locomotion with less actuators than the conventional legged robots. To model the mobility of a robot with this novel configuration, we firstly select candidate configurations from all of the possible configurations by performing mobility analysis on the robot. Then, feasible gait patterns for achieving planar locomotion are designed with these candidate configurations. The idea that legged locomotion is achievable by less actuators as well as the gait planning methods are verified finally by simulations.",

        "abstract": "During typical robot-assisted training sessions, patients are required to execute tasks with the assistance of a robot while receiving feedback on a 2D display. Three-dimensional tasks of this sort require the adoption of stereoscopy to achieve correct visuo-motor-proprioceptive alignment. Stereoscopy often causes side-effects as sickness and tiredness, and it may affect the processes of recovery and cortical reorganization of the patients' brain in an unclear way. It follows that it is preferrable for a robot-assisted neurorehabilitation therapy to work in a real 3D setup containing real objects rather than using virtual reality. In this paper, we propose a new system for robot-assisted neurorehabilitation scenarios which allows patients to execute therapy by manipulating real, generic 3D objects. The proposed system is based on a new algorithm for identification and tracking of generic objects which makes efficient use of a Microsoft Kinect sensor. We discuss the results of several experiments conducted in order to test robustness, accuracy and speed of the tracking algorithm and the feasibility of the integrated system.",

The active-caster presents omnidirectional motion on the ground with providing an active traction force in an arbitrary direction by controlling a 2DOF planar velocity vector created by independent two motors. The proposed mechanism includes a dual-ball transmission to transmit traction power to rotate and orient a drive wheel with distributing velocity components to wheel and steering axes in an appropriate ratio. One of the significant features of the proposed mechanism is that a velocity ratio between wheel rotation and steering rotation is determined mechanically by the dual-ball transmission, where the ratio is a function of an orientation of a wheel, therefore a sensor for measuring a wheel orientation and calculations for velocity decomposition are totally removed from a conventional control system.",

To this effect, the theory of Gaussian Processes (usually used for estimation purposes) is suitably adapted to tackle the problem of harbour patrolling. The introduction of a time varying dependency in the probabilistic formulation (thus allowing for the sampled field to be dynamic, i.e., changing in time) makes the proposed solution suitable for the type of mission considered. Moreover, the advantages of Voronoi tessellations are exploited to automatically distribute the vehicles over the environment. The resulting algorithm takes into account several constraints and can be tailored based on the communication and computational capabilities of the robots, thus making it suitable for heterogeneous systems. Numerical simulations and experiments involving three autonomous marine surface vehicles in a harbour scenario at the Parque Expo site in Lisbon are discussed.",

Its closed form solution leads directly to simple analytic formulas for the system eigenvalues in terms of geometric design parameters. To illustrate the power of the theory, the new methods are used to re-design an actual manipulator currently in use on the International Space Station. Unlike the existing manipulator, the new design is dynamically decoupled and isotropic.",

        "abstract": "Hardware platforms with limited processing power are often incapable of running dense stereo analysis algorithms at acceptable speed. Sparse algorithms provide an alternative but generally lack in accuracy. To overcome this predicament, we present an efficient sparse stereo analysis algorithm that applies a dense consistency check, leading to accurate matching results. We further improve matching accuracy by introducing a new feature detector based on FAST, which exhibits a less clustered feature distribution. The new feature detector leads to a superior performance of our stereo analysis algorithm. Performance evaluation shows that the proposed stereo matching system achieves processing rates above 200 frames per second on a commodity dual core CPU, and faster than video frame-rate processing on a low-performance embedded platform. The stereo matching results prove to be superior to those obtained with ordinary sparse matching algorithms.",

Both actuators are linked through an overrunning clutch. Thus, the motor is connected to the handle while the brake can exert a resistive force only in a defined direction. This configuration enables the brake and the motor to be engaged at the same time because the torque imposed by the motor is not canceled by the brake. The concept and its control laws have been investigated using a 1-DOF haptic device. The experimental results show that is possible to combine a powerful brake with a small DC motor. This approach reduces the power consumption, expand the range of forces, achieve global stability in the system providing thereby safety to the user. Besides, the proposed independent control laws enable the actuator to be adaptable in many different haptic applications.",

        "abstract": "Assistive technologies, especially mobility devices, have had a profound impact on the daily activities and social participation not only of healthy elderly persons, but also of elderly care-receivers. To this end, the authors have developed a new mobility interface, the SLIDE FLEX, which extends the mobility activities of users by maintaining body function by using upper limb motions. We designed and developed a new operation system, a touch slide sensor. The concept of the new system is to use separate arm support to measure the position, displacement and velocity of each arm, and to use these data as input signals to control the system. The SLIDE FLEX enables the user to propel herself/himself naturally while motors assist her/his propulsion speed. The main components are a touch slide with a capacitance slider sensor, a control system, and a powered wheelchair. Sensors in the arm support detect positional information, which is calculated as three types of control input: position, displacement, and propulsion velocity. These input signals for each arm are recognized as indications of the user's intention to change direction and are used to turn the vehicle. Preliminary evaluations indicate that this new system is both safe and useful.",

Traditionally, perception is supposed to be an inherent capacity of the agent. Moreover, it largely relies on models built by the system's designer. A new approach is to consider perception as an experimentally acquired ability that is learned exclusively through the analysis of the agent's sensorimotor flow. Previous works, based on H.Poincar\u00e9's intuitions and the sensorimotor contingencies theory, allow a simulated agent to extract the dimension of geometrical space in which it is immersed without any a priori knowledge. Those results are limited to infinitesimal movement's amplitude of the system. In this paper, a non-linear dimension estimation method is proposed to push back this limitation.",

The approach consists of a navigation component that computes a desired heading angle to ensure the USV will arrive at the path, and a nonlinear controller to guarantee exponential tracking of surge velocity and heading. Additionally, ultimate boundedness of the unactuated sway velocity is proven. Simulation results are presented to show numerically that the controller works as expected in the ideal case. Outdoor experimental results are presented, using a GPS and compass as sensors, showing the practical feasibility of the approach in the presence of sensor noise, disturbances, and unmodeled dynamics.",

        "abstract": "It is well known that parallel mechanisms have several advantages, namely high power, rapidity and high stiffness. However, their workspace is limited due to interference of each chain. In our previous work, to expand the workspace of Delta mechanisms, ball bearings were employed instead of ball joints. Although this allowed a relatively wide workspace to be achieved, the clearance gap of the ball bearings introduced undesirable flexibility, while mechanical limitations persisted. In this paper, to tackle these problems, a novel parallel mechanism with wire-pulleys is proposed. The basic structure of the new mechanism is the same as that of the conventional Delta mechanism, but wire-pulleys are employed instead of a parallel four-bar mechanism. The key feature of the wire-pulleys is its lack of mechanical limitations. A prototype has been designed and developed, which achieves a wider workspace and reduced backlash. In addition, the total parts quantity has declined by more than 25%. Fundamental experiments show its potential.",

        "abstract": "Pseudo-omnidirectional robots with independently steerable wheels require a method to synchronize the steering motion of the wheels in order to keep a unique instantaneous center of rotation (ICR). For standard wheels, the instantaneous center of rotation is defined as the intersection point of all wheel axes. We present a novel approach to deal with the problem of continuously shifting the center of rotation of a pseudo-omnidirectional rover from an initial to a demanded position in the Cartesian plane. The main contribution is the consideration of substantial velocity and acceleration limits on the steering units, as well as mechanical constraints and noise affected sensor measurements. We solve this problem by deriving a relationship between the steering accelerations of the single wheels and the acceleration of the center of rotation. We furthermore provide a contribution to the tracking of the ICR in the presence of significant sensor noise. Our results are evaluated by tests on the rover breadboard developed during the activities for the ExoMars mission.",

Tribot equips with six Tri-star wheels and each wheel can be driven independently. The chassis of the Tribot is divided into two parts which are connected by an articulated mechanism, making the Tribot has a remarkable obstacle performance to adapt changing environments mechanically, without any interpolate complex control. Numerous experiments have been conducted for vertical obstacle performance tests. Although the diameter of the wheel of the Tribot is only 220 mm, the robot can climb over vertical obstacle of 450 mm high, twice more of the wheel diameter. All results show that Tribot has excellent vertical climbing performance in unstructured environments.",

        "track": "main",
        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "Slip prediction is important for maintaining the stability of object handling in robust grasping and dexterous manipulation. However, up to date a challenge still remains that how to accurately predict slip occurrence before it actually happens to allow robotic hands to conduct slip compensation in time. The concept of friction cone has been conventionally used to predict slip occurrence, where the static/kinetic friction coefficient is used as a threshold. However, this threshold, i.e. the ratio of the friction and normal forces at slip occurrence (also named as break-away friction ratio), is found not constant but varies with changes in acceleration and disturbing forces applied on the grasped object, raising difficulties when attempting to accurately predict slip. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to accurately predict varying slip thresholds in real time and compensate the predicted slip during a dynamic grasping. To achieve this, first a simple but efficient haptic surface exploration using robotic fingers is carried out to identify the friction properties of an object surface. Once the friction properties are established, the slip threshold at a given grasping condition can be predicted and the grasping forces are adjusted to prevent slip. The presented approach has been evaluated, showing good performance in terms of prediction accuracy and computational efficiency.",

This paper presents a novel manipulator that allows for ergonomic bimanual joint-level control of an anthropomorphic surgical robot. Through the combined use of bidirectional compressed airflow, the manipulator can operate on nearly zero friction and simulate a range of frictional forces. As a generic platform, the system can withstand large payloads and is able to accommodate a wide range of existing haptic manipulators. The performance of the proposed platform is evaluated with detailed experimental tests and proven to provide negligible friction even at high loads. Its dynamic friction is controllable and positional locking can be flexibly applied. Detailed experimental results demonstrate the practical value of the system.",

        "abstract": "Most conventional robotic arms use motors to accelerate the manipulator. This leads to an unnecessary high energy consumption when performing repetitive tasks. This paper presents an approach to reduce energy consumption in robotic arms by performing its repetitive tasks with the help of a parallel spring mechanism. A special non-linear spring characteristic has been achieved by attaching a spring to two connected pulleys. This parallel spring mechanism provides for the accelerations of the manipulator without compromising its ability to vary the task parameters (the time per stroke, the displacement per stroke the grasping time and the payload). The energy consumption of the arm with the spring mechanism is compared to that of the same arm without the spring mechanism. Optimal control studies show that the robotic arm uses 22% less energy due to the spring mechanism. On the 2 DOF prototype, we achieved an energy reduction of 20%. The difference was due to model simplifications. With a spring mechanism, there is an extra energetic cost, because potential energy has to be stored into the spring during startup. This cost is equal to the total energy savings of the 2 DOF arm during 8 strokes. Next, there could have been an energetic cost to position the manipulator outside the equilibrium position. We have designed the spring mechanism in such a way that this holding cost is negligible for a range of start- and end positions. The performed experiments showed that the implementation of the proposed spring mechanism results in a reduction of the energy consumption while the arm is still able to handle varying task parameters.",

        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "This paper presents a novel method for rigid surface registration using torchlight structure as data association, and the new method improves the correctness of point matching. When two sets of point clouds are merged, assume a set of torchlight beams parallely pass through them, and each light ray passes the overlapped data twice, one on each set. The Euclidean distance on such pair is taken as measurement of the separation. When the two sets are optimally aligned, the registration error is minimized. Hence, surface registration problem is reduced to a six degree of freedom searching procedure. Preprocessing, optimization, and acceleration modules are introduced to normalize raw data, explore registration space, and reduce execution time. Unlike the Iterative Closest Point (ICP) algorithm, the proposed approach does not require pre-alignment information. Secondly, the performance of ICP is poor when the overlapped area between two sets is not sufficiently large. The proposed approach does not suffer from these problems. Based on various experiments, the proposed approach shows the superior performance over ICP.",

In this work we present a well-structured, parameterized controller and describe a method for optimizing its parameters in order to achieve the best possible performance subject to the system's physical constraints. We then show how the configuration space of the DFA can be parameterized by only a few variables and propose a straightforward approach for mapping this configuration space to its control parameter space.",

        "abstract": "This paper details a methodology for using structured light laser imaging to create high resolution bathymetric maps of the sea floor. The system includes a pair of stereo cameras and an inclined 532nm sheet laser mounted to a remotely operated vehicle (ROV). While a structured light system generally requires a single camera, a stereo vision set up is used here for in-situ calibration of the laser system geometry by triangulating points on the laser line. This allows for quick calibration at the survey site and does not require precise jigs or a controlled environment. A batch procedure to extract the laser line from the images to sub-pixel accuracy is also presented. The method is robust to variations in image quality and moderate amounts of water column turbidity. The final maps are constructed using a reformulation of a previous bathymetric Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) algorithm called incremental Smoothing and Mapping (iSAM). The iSAM framework is adapted from previous applications to perform sub-mapping, where segments of previously visited terrain are registered to create relative pose constraints. The resulting maps can be gridded at one centimeter and have significantly higher sample density than similar surveys using high frequency multibeam sonar or stereo vision. Results are presented for sample surveys at a submerged archaeological site and sea floor rock outcrop.",

        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "In this study, we propose a system to enable robots to navigate more efficiently to target objects in order to carry out mobile manipulation tasks. Because a robot arm has limited reach, a target object cannot be grasped if the distance to the object exceeds the reach. At the same time, navigation errors may increase as the robot moves around in an environment. To mitigate these problems, we propose the use of maps that express the arm reachability and navigation reachability. Places with minimum probability of navigation errors and maximum tolerable navigation errors for the reach of the arm can be determined by integrating these two maps. We also consider the fact that the target object position is not always known. To cope with this problem, we introduce an object existence map that represents the ambiguity of the target object position, considering the past position. If the ambiguity is large, it is possible to select a place from where the object searching task can be performed with a wide angle of view by the robot. Efficient object searching can be achieved by changing the task objective from searching to grasping and vice versa. We conducted some mobile manipulation tasks to evaluate the proposed method. The results showed that the proposed system can perform such tasks effectively.",

        "abstract": "Safe robot navigation in tree fruit orchards requires that the vehicle be capable of robustly navigating between rows of trees and turning from one aisle to another; that the vehicle be dynamically stable, especially when carrying workers; and that the vehicle be able to detect obstacles on its way and adjust its speed accordingly. In this paper we address the latter, in particular the problem of detecting people and apple bins in the aisles between rows. One of our requirements is that the obstacle avoidance subsystem shouldn't add to the robot's hardware cost, so as to keep the acquisition cost to growers as low as possible. Therefore, we confine ourselves to solutions that use only the sensor suite already installed on the robot for navigation-in our case, a laser scanner, low-cost inertial measurement unit, and steering and wheel encoders. Our methodology is based on the classification and clustering of registered 3D points as obstacles. In the current implementation, obstacle avoidance takes in 3D point clouds collected in apple orchards and generates an off-line assessment of obstacle position. Tests conducted at our experimental orchard-like environment in Pittsburgh and an actual apple orchard in Washington state indicate that the method is able to detect people and bins located along the vehicle path. Stretch tests indicate that it is also capable of dealing with objects as small as 15 cm tall as long as they aren't covered by grass, and to detect people crossing the aisles at walking speed.",

The architecture learns object affordances through human observations, imposed constraints, and hardcoded physics logic. Human observations are also used to develop a unique manipulation repertoire suitable for the robot. Bayesian Networks are then used to probabilistically determine manipulation strategies for the robot to execute. The robot leverages this knowledge during experimental trials where manipulation strategies suggested by the reasoning architecture are shown to perform well during new manipulation tasks.",

        "track": "main",
        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "Snap assembly automation remains a challenging task. While progress is being made in localization of parts, force controllers, and control strategies, little work has been done to help the robot reason about its current state, such that if necessary, the robot can assume corrective actions to accomplish the task. Error prone situations caused by the unexpected motion of parts, localization errors, jamming or wedging, cannot be solved by force controllers alone. For this reason we propose a snap assemblies verification system for cantilever-snap fasteners. The verification works in concert with a control strategy that makes use of constraint designs embedded in the snap parts' physical design. The constrained assembly motion generates similar sensory-signal patterns across trials that facilitates force signal discrimination into higher level abstractions of intuitive behavior. This work's contribution is the design of a hierarchical taxonomy for cantilever-snap verification based on increasingly abstract layers that encode relative-change in the task's force signatures. A five-layered taxonomy is built on the concept that relative-change patterns can be classified through a small category set and aided by contextual information. The verification system yielded human apropos intuitive categorizations of task behavior for every state and effectively determined the assembly result. This simple yet effective approach will be expanded to perform probabilistic online system verification to aid in fault tolerance and the automation of cantilever-based snap assemblies.",

        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "Robotic agents that interact with humans and perform complex, everyday tasks in natural environments will require a system to autonomously organize their behavior. Current systems for robotic behavioral organization typically abstract from the low-level sensory-motor embodiment of the robot, leading to a gap between the level at which a sequence of actions is planned and the levels of perception and motor control. This gap is a major bottleneck for the autonomy of systems in complex, dynamic environments. To address this issue, we present a neural-dynamic framework for behavioral organization, in which the action selection mechanism is tightly coupled to the agent's sensory-motor systems. The elementary behaviors (EBs) of the robot are dynamically organized into sequences based on task-specific behavioral constraints and online perceptual information. We demonstrate the viability of our approach by implementing a neural-dynamic architecture on the humanoid robot NAO. The system is capable of producing sequences of EBs that are directed at objects (e.g., grasping and pointing). The sequences are flexible in that the robot autonomously adapts the individual EBs and their sequential order in response to changes in the sensed environment. The architecture can accommodate different tasks and can be articulated for different robotic platforms. Its neural-dynamic substrate is particularly well-suited for learning and adaptation.",

        "abstract": "The results of the neuroscientific research show that humans tend to stabilize the head orientation during locomotion. In this paper we describe the implementation of inverse kinematics based head stabilization controller on the humanoid platform. The controller uses the IMU feedback and controls neck joints in order to align the head orientation with the global orientation reference. Thanks to the method, we can decouple the orientational motion of the head from the rest of the body. This way stabilized head becomes better platform for proprioceptive sensory apparatus, such as cameras or IMU. In the paper we present three experiments which prove that the method has good performance in damping both, high and low frequency motion of the head. We also prove that the proposed controller improves the stability of the tracked goal point on the image of in-built camera.",

        "abstract": "Recently RGB-D sensors have become very popular in the area of Simultaneous Localisation and Mapping (SLAM). The major advantage of these sensors is that they provide a rich source of 3D information at relatively low cost. Unfortunately, these sensors in their current forms only have a range accuracy of up to 4 metres. Many techniques which perform SLAM using RGB-D cameras rely heavily on the depth and are restrained to office type and geometrically structured environments. In this paper, a switching based algorithm is proposed to heuristically choose between RGB-BA and RGBD-BA based local maps building. Furthermore, a low cost and consistent optimisation approach is used to join these maps. Thus the potential of both RGB and depth image information are exploited to perform robust SLAM in more general indoor cases. Validation of the proposed algorithm is performed by mapping a large scale indoor scene where traditional RGB-D mapping techniques are not possible.",

        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "Rotary encoders and resolvers are by far the most common sensors to measure joint angles in articulated robots. Since various control approaches require angular rates as well, resolvers and encoders are also employed to derive angular rate signals. Due to the involved differentiation operation, however, quantization noise may be augmented significantly. Advanced filtering approaches can only partially overcome this drawback. Therefore, direct measurement of angular rates is desirable. Due to advancements in manufacturing technology and pushed by applications in entertainment devices, MEMS gyroscopes have become an attractive alternative for angular rate measurement. Unfortunately, they are affected by bias and other non-negligible disturbances, which may be a serious problem if consistent joint angle and angular rate measurements are required. The proposed approach fuses encoder and angular rate signals to mitigate their major drawbacks - bias and quantization errors - by exploiting their individual strong points. Bias in the angular rate signal is eliminated by analyzing the deviation between the integrated angular rate signal and the encoder signal. Quantization errors in the encoder signal are reduced by a so-called complementary filter which blends the integrated angular rate output with the encoder signal. Apart from a description of the approach and a theoretical analysis of its characteristics, experimental results demonstrating the effectiveness of the approach in closed-loop control of articulated robots are presented.",

The stability of locomotion strongly depends on the mechanical properties of the body mechanism, especially joint stiffness. In this report, the muscle tone of the robot's motion at the trunk can be changed by using the changeable elasticity of pneumatic actuators. The stability of quadruped locomotion in crawl, trot and pace patterns with changeable body stiffness was evaluated with hardware experiments. As well, the stabilization mechanism is approximated by a simple two-inertia model and analyzed with numerical simulations.",

The proposed method enables a slave robotic hand to grasp an object in a remote environment in several ways, manipulate it, and mimic several non-grasping motions. The key components of the proposed control system are a grasping selector in the master system and motion controllers and a controller selector in the slave system. The grasping selector learns to detect motions commanded by an operator using datagloves. We developed two methods to learn the operator's hand shapes, one that prioritizes the learning time and one that prioritizes the probability of correct detection. The controller selector determines the current command and awaits a transition, while the motion controllers stably realize the currently commanded motion. We have demonstrated the stable operation of a three-fingered robotic hand using the proposed method.",

A theoretical analysis of the convergence properties is presented for the proposed swarm aggregation algorithm. Extensive simulations have been performed to corroborate the theoretical results. In addition, experiments with a team of low-cost mobile robots have been carried out to show the effectiveness of the proposed approach.",

The model does not include compliance, and can capture the kinematics of the observed locomotion behavior that corresponds to an alternating tetrapod gait. We exploit symmetries and synergies to reduce the eight-legged robot to a mechanism that is composed by two switching four-bar linkages, each representing the collective effect of a tetrapod in contact with the ground. Notwithstanding its apparent simplicity, the resulting model reproduces on average the motion of the robot. In addition, by properly tuning a family of physically-relevant parameters - including touchdown and sweep angles - different motion primitives corresponding to circular and forward motions can be realized. This model represents a first step toward developing reduced-order kinematic representations of legged robots that can be used for motion planning and feedback control purposes.",

        "abstract": "Enabling robots to safely interact with humans is an essential goal of robotics research. The developments achieved over the last years in mechanical design and control made it possible to have active cooperation between humans and robots in rather complex situations. In these terms, safe behavior of the robot even under worst-case situations is crucial and forms also a basis for higher level decisional aspects. In order to quantify what safe behavior really means, the definition of injury, as well as understanding its general dynamics are essential. This insight can then be applied to design and control robots such that injury due to robot-human impacts is explicitly taken into account. In this paper we approach the problem from a medical injury analysis point of view in order to formulate the relation between robot mass, velocity, impact geometry, and resulting injury qualified in medical terms. We transform these insights into processable representations and propose a motion supervisor that utilizes injury knowledge for generating safe robot motions. The algorithm takes into account the reflected inertia, velocity, and geometry at possible impact locations.

        "abstract": "Mobile manipulation robots are becoming more and more common and begin to extend their task spectrum towards more general housework activities. The sequence of actions needed to accomplish such tasks can be obtained from instructions on the Internet originally written for humans. While giving valuable information about the types of actions and some of their parameters, these instructions usually lack information that humans consider to be obvious. In this paper, we investigate how we can equip robots with sufficient knowledge and inference mechanisms to competently detect and fill such knowledge gaps in descriptions of everyday activities. We present methods for projecting the effects of actions and processes, for inferring action parameters like the objects and locations to be used, and introduce representations for reasoning about object transformations resulting from the effects of actions.",

        "abstract": "Most of today's robots, while being equipped with arrays of ever more impressive sensors, still lack a fundamental ability so readily available to biological systems: a sense of touch. With the exception of a few humanoid platforms tactile sensing is typically limited to small areas such as palms or finger tips. In this paper we present a tactile sensing system designed specifically to meet the needs of covering large, possibly curved surfaces of the robot. The sensors are at the same time highly sensitive and robust, cheap to manufacture and can be made to have almost any size and shape. As such the presented system can ideally complement existing systems and their high spatial resolution required in finger tips with a system providing highly sensitive and impact resistant coverage for the rest of the body.",

        "abstract": "A hybrid simulator is a simulator which embeds a hardware experiment in a numerical simulation. However, the hybrid simulator is generally subjected to an inherent problem of energy increase in collision of two hardwares in the loop because of delay times. To solve this problem, Osaki et al. proposed a compensation method of delay time that can realize a variable coefficient of restitution [1]. However, the above method has a drawback that a model error of the system degrades the accuracy of the compensation method. This paper describes the influence of the model error and proposes a new approach to improve the accuracy of delay time compensation based on the coefficient of restitution by introducing a new model of the system. A collision experiment by the hybrid simulator is carried out to validate the accuracy of the proposed compensation method compared with the conventional compensation method.",

The localisation information is derived from the 3D data thanks to the ICP (Iterative Closest Point) algorithm. The covariance of the ICP, and thus of the localization error, is analysed, and described by a Fisher Information Matrix. It is advocated this error can be much reduced if the data is fused with measurements from other motion sensors, or even with prior knowledge on the motion. The data fusion is performed by a recently introduced specific extended Kalman filter, the so-called Invariant EKF, and is directly based on the estimated covariance of the ICP. The resulting filter is natural, and is proved to possess strong properties. Experiments with a Kinect sensor and a three-axis gyroscope prove clear improvement in the accuracy of the localization, and thus in the accuracy of the built 3D map.",

        "abstract": "We propose three novel methods to evaluate a distance function for robotic motion planning based on semiinfinite programming (SIP) framework; these methods include golden section search (GSS), conservative advancement (CA) and a hybrid of GSS and CA. The distance function can have a positive and a negative value, each of which corresponds to the Euclidean distance and penetration depth, respectively. In our approach, each robot's link is approximated and bounded by a capsule shape, and the distance between some selected link pairs is continuously evaluated along the joint's trajectory, provided by the SIP solver, and the global minimum distance is found. This distance is fed into the SIP solver, which subsequently suggests a new trajectory. This process is iterated until no negative distance is found anywhere in the links of the robot.We have implemented the three distance evaluation methods, and experimentally validated that the proposed methods effectively and accurately find the global minimum distances to generate a self-collision-free motion for the HRP-2 humanoid robot. Moreover, we demonstrate that the hybrid method outperforms other two methods in terms of computational speed and reliability.",

Our approach combines data from an odometry sensor with output from a visual registration algorithm, and it enforces a Manhattan world constraint by utilizing factor graphs to produce an accurate online estimate of the trajectory of a mobile robotic platform. We also examine the advantages and limitations of the octree data structure representation of a 3D environment. Through several experiments in environments with varying sizes and construction we show that our method reduces rotational and translational drift significantly without performing any loop closing techniques.",

        "abstract": "We have been developing and studying musculoskeletal humanoids. Our goal is to realize more human-like humanoids which can do natural and dynamic motions as well as humans. Especially motions with complex contact with environments, which is jumping, running, catching a ball, and landing on one's hands, etc, are difficult to be achieved by humanoids. To achieve that motions, robots have to absorb shock force so as not to break ones' body structures, such as gears, motors, body links and so on. Musculo-skeletal humanoids are suited for these situations, because they can easily have mechanical flexibilit for shock absorption by adding elastic units, which is nonlinear spring units, to its own tendons. In this paper, we propose shock absorption methods by musculoskeletal humanoids, which uses its own mechanical flexibilit and simple refle of each muscles based on tension sensor. This strategy is inspired by human's motion control, and it can achieve shock absorption tasks without any fast sensor feedback controls and any prediction ocntrols used by conventional robots with rigid bodies. We chose a catching a ball task as an example of complex contact motions, implemented the proposed strategy to musculoskeletal humanoid Kenzoh and confirme the feasibility of proposed method by actually catching a ball demonstration.",

This would enable them to verify their beliefs about the common tasks and the goals of their human partners and detect unexpected events and failures. In this paper we present a way of acquiring general, spatio-temporal plan representations from human motion tracking data in different environments. Using an annotated data set for table setting tasks in a typical kitchen environment, we first cluster the static positions of the participants and create a spatial model relative to furniture objects that are given by a semantic map and linked to a knowledge base. Based on this spatial model learned in one kitchen, we automatically generate spatio-temporal plan representations in different kitchen environments with known semantic maps. We show that our models can successfully be used to give a robot a basic understanding about a task executed by a human in three different environments. We evaluate the quality of our automatic generation of the plan representations and present an example application of plan supervision using a learned model from one kitchen to differentiate tasks performed by humans in other kitchens.",

In order to improve the manipulation learning ability of a robot with a human-like hand, this paper introduces a segmentation method based on the techniques of action gist. Action gist is the key motion information in manipulation with the property of semantics. In the techniques of in-hand manipulation action gist, there is a Meta Motion Occurrence Histogram describing the motion information in the demonstration set. This paper proposes an algorithm related to the Meta Motion Occurrence Histogram to maximize the common motions in each segment, so as to figure out the best segmentation solution in the in-hand manipulation sequence. The experiments illustrate the performance of the proposed method, and discuss the possibility of segmentation fusing with the information from tactile sensor.",

The method evaluates the utility of exploratory and place revisiting sequences and chooses the one that minimizes overall map and path entropies. The technique considers trajectories of similar path length taking marginal pose uncertainties into account. An advantage of the proposed strategy with respect to competing approaches is that to evaluate information gain over the map, only a very coarse prior map estimate needs to be computed. Its coarseness is independent and does not jeopardize the Pose SLAM estimate. Moreover, a replanning scheme is devised to detect significant localization improvement during path execution. The approach is tested in simulations in a common publicly available dataset comparing favorably against frontier based exploration.",

Wrapping the material around a joint will allow simultaneous motion sensing and active force response through shape and rigidity control. This monolithic elastomer sheet contains a series of miniaturized pneumatically-powered McKibben-type actuators that exert tension and enable adaptive rigidity control. The elastomer is embedded with conductive liquid channels that detect strain and bending deformations induced by the pneumatic actuators. In addition, the proposed system is modular and can be configured for a diverse range of motor tasks, joints, and human subjects. This modular functionality is accomplished with a decentralized network of self-configuring nodes that manage the collection of sensory data and the delivery of actuator feedback commands. This paper mainly describes the design of the soft orthotic device as well as actuator and sensor components. The characterization of the individual sensors, actuators, and the integrated device is also presented.",

        "abstract": "We propose a novel method for solving the localization problem, particularly useful in self-similar environments. Localization is the task of determining a robot's position with little or no prior knowledge about its initial location. We introduce a computationally efficient active strategy for the localization task. The proposed method also automatically generates optimal macro actions giving the robot the ability to localize in all environments. Combining the active strategy and macro actions, the method introduces an efficient strategy for determining a robot's position in any environment where localization is possible.",

        "abstract": "During heavy work, humans utilize whole body motions in order to generate large forces. In extreme cases, exaggerated weight shifts are used to impart large impact forces. There have been approaches to design stable whole body impact motions based on precise dynamic models of the robot and the target object, but they have practical limitations as the uncertainty in the ensuing reaction forces can lead to instability. In the current work, we describe a motion controller for a humanoid robot that generates impacts at an end effector while keeping the robot body balanced before and after the impact. Instead of relying on the accuracy of the impact dynamics model, we use a simplified model of the robot and biomechanically motivated push recovery controllers to reactively stabilize the robot against unknown perturbations from the impact. We demonstrate our approach in physically realistic simulations, as well as experimentally on a small humanoid robot platform.",

We then develop the mathematical model and numerically examine the adaptation ability to irregular terrain. In this paper, we consider the two situations; one is overcoming steps and the other is sustaining stable walking on a flexible surface.

We introduce actuator dimensional analysis for maximizing torque density and transmission \u2018transparency\u2019. A front leg prototype developed based on insight from the analysis is evaluated for direct proprioceptive force control without force sensors. The vertical stiffness controlled leg was tested on a material testing device to calibrate the mechanical impedance of the leg. By compensating transmission impedance from commanded torque, the leg was able to estimate impact force. For the impact test, the mean absolute error as a ratio of full scale sensor force is 0.041 in the 3406 N/m stiffness experiment and is 0.049 in the 5038 N/m experiment. The results indicate that prescribed force profile control is possible during high speed locomotion.",

        "abstract": "This paper presents a new trajectory generation algorithm for a space manipulator after capturing an uncooperative tumbling target. In particular, the previously developed Adaptive ReactionLess Control algorithm (ARLC) is extended to obtain minimum base reaction motion of the manipulator with consideration of joint limit constraints. A task-priority redundancy resolution technique is formulated within an adaptive control scheme with the primary task to maintain minimum disturbance to the base and the secondary task to avoid the physical joint limits. This control scheme is intended for use in the transition phase of the capture mission from the instant of capture till the unknown parameters are identified and/or the available post-capture stabilization methods can be applied properly. To verify the validity and feasibility of the proposed concept, MSC.Adams simulation platform is employed to implement a planar base-manipulator-target model as well as the three-dimensional model of Engineering Test Satellite VII system. The numerical results show that the proposed control scheme is able to generate the reactionless maneuver without violating joint limits of the arm, after capture of an unknown tumbling target.",

        "abstract": "Motivated by applications in robot-assisted physical rehabilitation, this paper presents an adaptive control design for robot manipulators operating in an ellipsoidal constrained region. The ellipsoidal constraint problem is more challenging than the box constraint problem tackled in previous works, since the nonlinear constraint boundary cannot be handled in a decoupled manner along the dimensions of the task space. We introduce a novel Barrier Lyapunov Function (BLF) which contains a quotient of the squared norm of the tracking error over the ellipsoidal task space constraint. This function allows the task space constraint to be handled directly without requiring an intermediate mapping to the error space. We show that, under the proposed BLF-based adaptive control, the end-effector always remains in the constrained region despite the perturbing effects of online parameter adaptation and also the presence of bounded external disturbances. A simulation example illustrates the performance of the proposed control.",

Using the proposed controller, it is possible to synchronize the state behavior of the local and the remote robots. While prior art on adaptive teleoperation has addressed stability in such systems only for constant delays, we guarantee asymptotic stability in the presence of delays that may be time-varying and/or unequal in the forward and backward directions. Using the proposed controller, asymptotic stability of the bilateral teleoperation system subject to any bounded varying delay with a bounded rate of variation can be guaranteed. The proposed controller also has the ability to cope with parameter variations in the dynamics of the local and the remote robots. To study the transparency of the closed-loop teleoperation system, we prove that the position and velocity errors between the local and the remote manipulators converge to zero asymptotically. To show the efficiency of the proposed controller, simulation results on a pair of two-degree-of-freedom manipulators with varying time delays in the communication channel are presented.",

        "abstract": "Most experiments on policy search for robotics focus on isolated tasks, where the experiment is split into two distinct phases: (1) the learning phase, where the robot learns the task through exploration; (2) the exploitation phase, where exploration is turned off, and the robot demonstrates its performance on the task it has learned. In this paper, we present an algorithm that enables robots to continually and autonomously alternate between these phases. We do so by combining the `Policy Improvement with Path Integrals' direct reinforcement learning algorithm with the covariance matrix adaptation rule from the `Cross-Entropy Method' optimization algorithm. This integration is possible because both algorithms iteratively update parameters with probability-weighted averaging. A practical advantage of the novel algorithm, called PI2-CMA, is that it alleviates the user from having to manually tune the degree of exploration. We evaluate PI2-CMA's ability to continually and autonomously tune exploration on two tasks.",

In order to design control and analyze system stability a static friction model is applied which describes Coulomb, viscose and load dependent friction.

        "abstract": "Maintaining the grip on an artery with a pulsating impedance, holding the steering wheel of a vehicle on a bumpy terrain, or holding a live hamster without excessive squeezing may be trivial tasks to most humans. However, a robot will find it very difficult to maintain the grip of such uncertain objects based on real-time feedback control. This paper presents a stochastic control law to maintain the grip on an uncertain object while manipulating against external forces. The radial impedance parameters of the soft object is assumed to undergo Gaussian random variations. Here we demonstrate that the proposed model free grip controller can maintain a safe grip at two diagonally opposite points of the object merely based on the statistics of the normal force. It accomplishes this by computing a probability of grip failure to adapt the compression on the soft object. A novel optimal estimation algorithm that can concurrently estimate the unknown impedance parameters of the object and the states of the coupled dynamic system is discussed as a potential tool to be used in predictive optimal impedance control on uncertain objects. Experimental results on adaptive grip control on a cylindrical tube inflated and deflated with a Gaussian random variation has been presented to validate the algorithm.",

        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "This paper investigates how a walker could maintain the variability of an arbitrary set of state variables within desired margins while walking on an uncertain soft terrain. The state variables are dynamically related to the visco-elastic impedance parameters of the body on a given set of uncertain soft terrains using internal memory primitives. A rimless wheel, a walker in its simplest form, is used to perform numerical simulations based on analytical dynamic models and hardware experiments to test a novel algorithm. The rimless wheel model is widely used by the legged locomotion research community to understand basic collision and energetics during passive dynamic walking. Very often, variability of punctuated force perturbations across collisions between the legs and the ground cause uncertain steady state dynamics of walking. This leads to the existence of a finite probability that certain state variables can reach unstable regions. Such phenomenon is known as metastability of walking. In this case, we actuate the rimless wheel with a constant torque leaving it to develop any speed profile for a given visco-elastic impedance distribution of the ground and its own vertical visco-elastic impedance that pushes the rimless wheel against the ground. Here we measure the robustness of the novel algorithm by its ability to shift the distribution of collision forces to a safer region in order to minimize the probability of reaching a given critical force threshold. Our analysis shows that the generalization of the variability of walking in different regions of the internal and external visco-elastic impedance spaces can simplify the computational challenges of robust walking on uncertain visco-elastic terrains.",

        "abstract": "This paper addresses the question of how to create adaptive and smooth sequences of actions and how to decide among skill options in a continuous manner without the necessity of recurrent planning. Motion generation is based on serial and parallel blending of movement primitives (MP). MPs are modeled as dynamical systems on task coordinates with attractor behavior and augmented with additional signals to ease their coordination. Sequences and transitions between skills are realized in a unified way as bifurcating dynamical systems based on continuous-time recurrent neural networks. The neural output is used as activation signal for MPs. Besides continuous feedback from the controlled MPs, the neural dynamics is influenced by a cost term from a future prediction to allow the inhibition of an action flow that is expected to fail. First results are shown in a physical simulation environment on a high-DoF robotic hand-arm system. The system is capable of creating smooth transients of MPs. Robustness to disturbances can be observed as local adaptations of individual low-level MPs, flexible sequencing of MPs, and global error recovery by changing the whole strategy of how to perform a movement skill.",

        "abstract": "To match the richness and complexity of the sensory and motor functionalities of a human hand with a robust and economically reasonable robotic device remains one of the hardest challenges in the field. Previous work has explored the possibility to exploit insight from neuroscientific results on postural correlation patterns (synergies) taming the sensorimotor complexity of hands. The postural synergy model has been recently extended to account for grasp force control through a model of \u201csoft synergies\u201d which incorporate hand compliance. In this paper we propose a first translation of such principles in the design of a robot hand. It so turns out that the implementation of the soft synergy model in an effective design is not obvious. The solution proposed in this paper rests on ideas coming from under-actuated hand design. We give a synthesis method to realize a desired set of soft synergies through the principled design of adaptive under-actuated mechanisms, which we call the method of adaptive synergies. This approach leads to the design and implementation of a prototype modular hand capable of accommodating an arbitrary number of synergies. The effectiveness of the design is shown in grasping simulations and experiments.",

        "abstract": "This paper examines an advection-based protocol for the coordination of a networked, multi-agent system. Diffusion forms the basis of the popular consensus dynamics and is closely related to advection. It is with this motivation that we examine a discretized version of advection over a network with the flow field realized through directed graph edges. We endeavor to demonstrate that the subsequent advection protocol forms an attractive set of system dynamics for coordinated control. This paper includes a formulation of the advection dynamics on directed graphs and a presentation of some of its characteristics. We also demonstrate the versatility of the advection dynamics with a decentralized load balancing application.",

        "abstract": "For a quadrotor aircraft, we study the problem of planning a trajectory that connects two arbitrary states while allowing the UAV to grasp a moving target at some intermediate time. To this end, two classes of canonical grasping maneuvers are defined and characterized. A planning strategy relying on differential flatness is then proposed to concatenate one or more grasping maneuvers by means of spline-based subtrajectories, with the additional objective of minimizing the total transfer time. The proposed planning algorithm is not restricted to pure hovering-to-hovering motions and takes into account practical constraints, such as the finite duration of the grasping phase. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is shown by means of physically-based simulations.",

        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "Alternating gliding and active propulsion is a potentially energy saving strategy for small-scale flight. With the goal of finding optimal wing shapes for flapping-gliding robots we evaluate the quasi-steady aerodynamic performance of four butterfly species (Monarch (Danaus plexippus), the Orange Aeroplane (Pantoporia consimilis), the Glasswing (Acraea andromacha) and the Four-barred Swordtail (Protographium Ieosthenes)). We fabricate at-scale wing models based on measured wing shapes and vary the forewing angle in nine steps to account for the ability of the butterfly to change the relative orientation of its forewing and hindwing during flight. For comparison we include twelve non-biological planforms as performance benchmarks for the butterfly wing shapes. We then test these 48 wing models at 2m/s, 3.5m/s and 5m/s (Reynolds number between 2597 and 12632) in a low speed wind tunnel which allows lift and drag force measurements of centimeter-size wings. The results indicate that the forewing orientation which maximizes the wing span offers the best gliding performance and that overall the gliding ratios are highest at 3.5m/s. The wing shapes with the best gliding ratio are found in the Glasswing butterfly with a maximum of 6.26 which is very high compared to the gliding performance of similarly sized flying robots. The results from this study are important for the development of novel biologically-inspired flying micro robots as well as for biomechanics studies in biology.",

        "abstract": "AfNet, The Affordance Network is an open affordance computing initiative that provides affordance knowledge ontologies for common household articles in terms of affordance features using surface forms termed as afbits (affordance bits). AfNet currently offers 68 base affordance features (25 structural, 10 material, 33 grasp), providing over 200 object category definitions in terms of 4000 afbits. Symbol grounding algorithms for these affordance features enable recognition of objects in visual (RGB-D) data. While AfNet is built as a generic visual knowledge ontology for recognition, it is well suited for deployment on domestic robots. In this paper, we describe AfRob, an extension of AfNet for robotic applications. AfRob builds upon AfNet by imbibing semantic context and mapping for holistic recognition and manipulation of objects in domestic environments. AfRob also offers modules to enable robots to interact and grasp objects through the generation of grasp affordances. The paper also details the inference mechanisms that adapt AfNet for robots in domestic contexts. Results demonstrate the efficiency of the affordance driven approach to holistic visual processing.",

        "track": "main",
        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "When GPS, or other absolute positioning, is un-available, terrain-relative velocity is crucial for dead reckoning and the vehicle's pose estimate. Unfortunately, the position-denied accuracy of the inertial navigation system (INS) is governed by the performance of the linear velocity aiding sources, such as wheel odometry, which are typically corrupted by large systematic errors due to wheel slip. As a result, affordable terrestrial inertial navigation is ineffective in estimating position when denied position fixes for an extended period of time. For mobile robots, the mapping between inputs and resultant behavior depends critically on terrain conditions which vary significantly over time and space which cannot be pre-programmed. Past work has used Integrated Perturbative Dynamics (IPD) to identify successively systematic and stochastic models of wheel slip, but treated the pose filter only as input without improving the odometry measurements used for vehicle navigation. We present a unique approach of a predictive vehicle slip model in a delayed state extended Kalman filter. The relative pose difference between the current state and delayed state is used as a measurement update to the vehicle slip model. These results create an opportunity to compensate for wheel slip effects in terrestrial inertial navigation. This paper presents the design, calibration, and verification of such a system and concludes that the position-denied performance of the compensated system is far superior.",

A motor controls the moment arm (Insertion Point Eccentricity Control or IPEC) of a pretensioned spring, and though the magnitude of the spring force remains relatively constant, the changing moment arm produces torque about the ankle. The IPEC AFO is able to provide 3.51 Nm about the ankle in dorsiflexion and 3.88 Nm in plantar flexion with a spring modulus of 3110 N/m and an initial tension of 77 N. The torque was sufficient to prevent toe-drag during swing phase.

        "abstract": "This paper presents a Nonlinear AutoRegressive with eXogenous input (NARX)-based approach for human-emotion recognition from an input video. The dynamics of facial expressions are first captured by performing a temporal-spatial analysis by extracting local and spatial features using a pyramid of histograms of oriented gradients (PHOG) descriptor. Then the temporal phases of facial expressions are identified using our proposed Mutual-Information-based Delay Identification Algorithm. Finally, the emotion recognition problem is formulated into a parametric regression context using a recurrent NARX network. This approach enhances the cognitive skills of humanoid robots by adding the ability to recognize and understand affective emotional states of a human. Computer simulations were conducted to illustrate the performance of the proposed NARX-based approach with recurrent neural network realization. The proposed recurrent NARX network performed better than other existing human-emotion recognition systems and achieved a 91.5% recognition rate when tested using the Cohn-Kanade database.",

It is shown that if the robot is actuated by three rotors, any feasible kinematic trajectory is dynamically realizable. For the case of two rotors the conditions of controllability and dynamic realizability of a feasible kinematic trajectory are established. It is shown that in moving the robot by tracing straight lines and circles in the contact plane the dynamically realizable trajectories are not represented by the circles on the sphere, which is a feature of the kinematic model of pure rolling. The dynamic motion planning problem is then formulated in the optimal control settings, and the properties of the optimal trajectories are illustrated under simulation.",

The system consists of a mobile manipulator - a powerbot mobile base with a six degrees of freedom (DOF) powercube arm mounted on it. The arm is equipped with a wrist mounted line-scan range sensor, and the powerbot also has a line scan range sensor mounted on it. The task is to autonomously build 3D model of an object in situ. The system assumes no knowledge of either the object or the rest of the workspace of the robot. The overall planner integrates two next best view (NBV) algorithms, one for modeling and the other for exploration, along with a sensor-based roadmap planner for the manipulator and costmap-based planner for the mobile base. We have implemented the system and this video show that system is able to autonomously build a 3D point cloud model of an object in an unknown environment.",

        "abstract": "A fundamental challenge in multi-robot systems is that global information is needed to succeed in some tasks, while the system's computation and sensing are fundamentally distributed. This paper considers the problem of estimating the relative density of robots in particular regions of the environment, but without wishing to incur the cost of obtaining a consistent metric representation. We compute a probability density function that describes positions of the robots within the system by leveraging properties of the underlying communication network. We introduce three different strategies for using and combining local measurements via a modified Parzen window kernel density method. The result is a representation that is most accurate near to the querying robot but which maintains qualitative properties of the global density. We argue that this a useful relaxation of the problem because it is meaningful from the perspective of the robots within the system itself. Validation takes the form of simulations with hundreds of simple robots.",

Compared to a simple weight lifting system, which requires manual changing of weights, this new device allows users to change the load easily and continuously, with relatively lower power consumption.

The main idea is to trigger increased helpfulness by proactively creating similarity through dynamic emotional adaption of the robot to the mood of the human. This is achieved in an explicit and implicit way: Explicitly, by a similarity-statement of the robot of being in the same mood as the user, and implicitly by controlling the affective parameters of facial and verbal expressions of a robot head in an interaction scenario such that the current values of the human mood in the dimensions of pleasure, arousal, and dominance (PAD) are matched. In a first step, this is accomplished by an initial self-assessment by the human participant to be extended by automatic emotion recognition modules in a later stage. The effectiveness of the approach is confirmed by significant experimental results.",

The power-conserving physical interconnections among most of the dynamical subsystems allow for power exchange through their power ports. Power exchange is conceptually considered as information exchange among the dynamical subsystems and further utilized to develop a natural feedback-like information from a class of dynamical systems with inaccessible/unknown outputs. This information is used in the design of an energy-based state observer. Convergence stability of the estimation error for the proposed state observer is proved for systems with linear dynamics. Furthermore, robustness of the convergence stability is analyzed over a range of parameter deviation and model uncertainties. Experiments are conducted on a dynamical system with a single input and multiple inaccessible outputs (Fig. 1) to demonstrate the validity of the proposed energy-based state estimation formalism.",

As part of this working group, the Industrial Robots sub-group is tasked with studying industrial applications of the ontology. One of the first areas of interest for this subgroup is the area of kit building or kitting. This is a process that brings parts that will be used in assembly operations together in a kit and then moves the kit to the assembly area where the parts are used in the final assembly. This paper examines the knowledge representations that have been developed and implemented for the kitting problem.",

        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "A major challenge in HRI is to design a social robot that can attract a target human's attention to control his/her attention toward a particular direction in various social situations. If a robot would like to initiate an interaction with a person, it may turn its gaze to him/her for eye contact. However, it is not an easy task for the robot to make eye contact because such a turning action alone may not be enough to initiate an interaction in all situations, especially when the robot and the human are not facing each other or the human intensely attends to his/her task. In this paper, we propose a conceptual model of attention control with four phases: attention attraction, eye contact, attention avoidance, and attention shift. In order to initiate an attention control process, the robot first tries to gain the target participant's attention toward it through head turning, or head shaking action depending on the three viewing situations where the robot is captured in his/her field of view (central field of view, near peripheral field of view, and far peripheral field of view). After gaining her/his attention, the robot makes eye contact only with the target person through showing gaze awareness by blinking its eyes, and directs her/his attention toward an object by turning its eyes and head cues. Moreover, the robot can show attention to aversion behaviors if non-target persons look at it. We design a robot based on the proposed approach, and it is confirmed as effective to control the target participant's attention in experimental evaluation.",

The advantage of the implementation is to reduce the execution time while integrating advanced algorithms for autonomous manipulation. We describe our approach to 3-D perception, real-time planning, force compliant motions, and audio processing. Performance results for object grasping and complex manipulation tasks of in-house tests and of an independent evaluation team are presented.",

The architecture consists of an outer control loop, which is based on the kineto-statics of the RehabExos, and on four identical-independent inner full-state joint-torque controllers (IJTFC). The considered IJTFC demonstrate good stability, responsiveness and accuracy in tracking the desired torques generated by the outer controller. Comparison with other control strategies available from the literature is shown via analytical and experimental results, which highlight the improved performances of the proposed IJTFC method in controlling the RehabExos robot.",

Such \u201csemantic maps\u201d permit higher-level reasoning than occupancy maps, and are useful for any application that involves dealing with objects, including grasping, change detection, and object search. We describe and experimentally verify such a system aboard a mobile robot equipped with a Microsoft Kinect RGB-D sensor. Our representation is object-based, and makes uniquely weak assumptions about the quality of the perceptual data available; in particular, we perform no explicit object recognition. This allows our system to operate in large, dynamic, and uncon-strained environments, where modeling every object that occurs (or might occur) is impractical. Our dataset, which is publicly available, consists of 67 autonomous runs of our robot over a six-week period in a roughly 1600m2 office environment. We demonstrate two applications built on our system: semantic querying and change detection.",

        "abstract": "This paper proposes a supervised algorithm for online learning of input-output relations that is particularly suitable to simultaneously learn the forward and inverse kinematics of general manipulators - the multi-valued nature of the inverse kinematics of serial chains and forward kinematics of parallel manipulators makes it infeasible to apply state-of-the-art learning techniques to these problems, as they typically assume a single-valued function to be learned. The proposed algorithm is based on a generalized expectation maximization approach to fit an infinite mixture of linear experts to an online stream of data samples, together with an outlier probabilistic model that dynamically grows the number of linear experts allocated to the mixture, this way controlling the complexity of the resulting model. The result is an incremental, online and localized learning algorithm that performs nonlinear, multivariate regression on multivariate outputs by approximating the target function by a linear relation within each expert input domain, which can directly provide forward and inverse multi-valued estimates. The experiments presented in this paper show that it can achieve, for single-valued functions, a performance directly comparable to state-of-the-art online function approximation algorithms, while additionally providing inverse predictions and the capability to learn multi-valued functions in a natural manner. To our knowledge this is a distinctive property of the algorithm presented in this paper.",

This allows to easily integrate the simulation and visualization tool with existing control architectures, thus allowing hardware-in-the-loop simulations (HIL). UWSim has been successfully used for simulating the logics of underwater intervention missions and for reproducing real missions from the captured logs.

        "abstract": "This paper presents an optimal design method for a new robot called amphibious transformable robot which can not only perform reconfiguration but also implement tasks in amphibious environment. To satisfy a range of performance requirements for the robot in aquatic and terrestrial environments, the multi-objective optimization method is adopted to design the robot which can achieve the optimal comprehensive performance in the amphibious environment. Based on the kinematics and dynamic analysis of the robot, the multi-objective optimization problem of the mechanism parameters design is established on the mapping relationships between the performance indexes, and then Multi-Objective Genetic Algorithm is proposed to get Pareto solution. Based on combination weighting method of multi-attribute decision-making, the result can be extracted and used to direct the mechanism design of the amphibious transformable robot, Amoeba-II. The experiment for the maneuverability of Amoeba-II in the amphibious environment is performed to verify the validity and applicability of the mechanism-parameters design method of amphibious transformable robot based on Multi-Objective Genetic Algorithm.",

For this mechanism, we have developed a soft and flexible power assist device that consists of an elastic material and a small direct current motor. The assist force is then the elastic force, which is controlled by adjusting the length of the elastic material by means of the motor. The skill assist is based on a motion correction method of periodic motions that was developed in a previous study. The control method can provide both power assist and skill assist affects. In this study, we analyze the adequacy of the power assist when simultaneously applying the skill assist.",

Based on the simplified dynamics of a mass concentrated model, we generate a physically consistent motion that depends on the current CoM state space of the robot. If the disturbance is low, it is possible to adapt the trajectory in order to reach the desired next step position. In the case of strong disturbances, we show how to modify the final goal under a reactive stepping framework. Simulations and hardware experiments with the full-size humanoid HRP-4 show the validity of the proposed scheme.",

It can be used as a voluntary muscle since it is a linear actuator with non-linear elasticity similar to a voluntary muscle. It follows an application of the ANLES into a three DOF artificial joint arranged to use as a wrist joint of an anthropomorphic robot. At first it shows the first model controlled by four ANLESes and one extra-motor, which was under-actuated to control three joint angles and three joint stiffness. Next it shows the second model that is controlled by six ANLESes to control the angle and the stiffness of the concentrated three rotary axes.",

        "abstract": "Path planning in dynamic environments is significantly more difficult than navigation in static spaces due to the increased dimensionality of the problem, as well as the importance of returning good paths under time constraints. Anytime planners are ideal for these types of problems as they find an initial solution quickly and then improve it as time allows. In this paper, we develop an anytime planner that builds off of Safe Interval Path Planning (SIPP), which is a fast A*-variant for planning in dynamic environments that uses intervals instead of timesteps to represent the time dimension of the problem. In addition, we introduce an optional time-horizon after which the planner drops time as a dimension. On the theoretical side, we show that in the absence of time-horizon our planner can provide guarantees on completeness as well as bounds on the sub-optimality of the solution with respect to the original space-time graph. We also provide simulation experiments for planning for a UAV among 50 dynamic obstacles, where we can provide safe paths for the next 15 seconds of execution within 0.05 seconds. Our results provide a strong evidence for our planner working under real-time constraints.",

        "abstract": "In this paper, we present an approach to traversability classification solely based on monocular images and odometry estimates. We iteratively estimate the ground plane by detecting and matching features. Since the features are only sparse in the images and do not lead to dense information about traversability, we present a technique to train appearance-based floor detectors. In this way, we achieve a dense classification of the image data. Our approach trains the classifiers online in a self-supervised fashion from the ground plane estimation. During robot navigation, the classifiers are automatically updated and applied to the image stream to decide which areas are traversable. From this information, the robot can compute a two-dimensional occupancy grid map of the environment and use it for planning collision-free paths. As we illustrate in thorough experiments with a real humanoid, the classification results of our approach are highly accurate and the resulting occupancy map enables the robot to reliably avoid obstacles during navigation. Our appearance-based classifiers can also be used to augment stereo or RGBD-data in close ranges where these sensors cannot provide any depth information.",

        "abstract": "Recently, increased attention has been focused on single port endoscopic surgery (SPS). We have developed a robotic system for SPS with two surgical manipulators: an endoscopic manipulator and a positioning manipulator that moves the endoscope. The robot can manipulate both the position and orientation of the endoscope to achieve the desirable endoscopic field of view. Two methods can be used to operate the endoscopic view: \u201ccontrol corresponding to position\u201d mode and \u201ccontrol corresponding to velocity\u201d mode. Although both are widely used for moving the visual field, the operability of each method has not been examined quantitatively. Thus, we compare the operability of the two methods for adjusting the endoscopic view, and present the results and suitable applications of each method. The results of the quantitative evaluation experiments show that the \u201ccontrol corresponding to position\u201d mode is suitable for short-distance or precise adjustment of the endoscope, whereas the \u201ccontrol corresponding to velocity\u201d mode is better suited to long-distance movement.",

Therefore, in recent years identifying and semantically labeling the environments based on onboard sensors has become an important competency for mobile robots. Supervised learning algorithms have been extensively used for this purpose with SVM-based solutions showing good generalization properties. The CRF-based approaches take the advantage of connectivity information of samples thereby provide a mechanism to capture complex dependencies. Blending the complementary strengths of Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Conditional Random Field (CRF), there have been algorithms to exploit the advantages of both to enhance the overall accuracy of place classification in indoor environments. However, experiments show that none of the above approaches deal well with diversified testing data. In this paper, we focus mainly on the generalization ability of the model and propose a semi-supervised learning strategy, which essentially improves the performance of the system. Experiments have been carried out on six real-world maps from different universities around the world and the results from rigorous testing demonstrate the feasibility of the approach.",

Our study comprises experiments with both a pneumatic parallel gripper and a suction cup. The baseline is a prioritized list of grasps that have been chosen manually by an experienced engineer. We discuss generally the probability space for success probability in bin picking and we provide suggestions for robust success probability estimates for difference sizes of experimental sets. By performing grasps equivalent to one or two days in production, we show that the success probabilities can be significantly improved by the proposed learning procedure.",

A reinforcement learning was then implemented to optimize the trajectories with respect to energy consumption, similarity to a human's natural motion and, physical limits. Energy cost was estimated by joint torque from a dynamic model, and validated against actual measured torque values using system identification (SID). With a motion capture system, human motions were collected for a given set of tasks, producing a representative \u201cnatural\u201d motion, another cost for optimization. Physical limits of each joint ensured spatial and temporal smoothness of generated trajectories. Finally, an experimental evaluation of the presented approach was demonstrated through simulation using MiniHubo model in OpenRAVE.",

        "abstract": "As robots are being integrated into our daily lives, it becomes necessary to provide guarantees of safe and provably correct operation. Such guarantees can be provided using automata theoretic task and mission planning where the requirements are expressed as temporal logic specifications. However, in real-life scenarios, it is to be expected that not all user task requirements can be realized by the robot. In such cases, the robot must provide feedback to the user on why it cannot accomplish a given task. Moreover, the robot should indicate what tasks it can accomplish which are as \u201cclose\u201d as possible to the initial user intent. Unfortunately, the latter problem, which is referred to as minimal specification revision problem, is NP complete. This paper presents an approximation algorithm that can compute good approximations to the minimal revision problem in polynomial time. The experimental study of the algorithm demonstrates that in most problem instances the heuristic algorithm actually returns the optimal solution. Finally, some cases where the algorithm does not return the optimal solution are presented.",

        "abstract": "Manipulators, which are mounted on robots that substitute man at dangerous places like indoors and outdoors disaster sites or mine fields, have been mainly controlled by joysticks. However, joysticks are difficult to manipulate and complex tasks become hard to be done by operators because of a limit and discordance of controlled degree of freedom. Therefore, a controller with high operability like the Master-Slave system is needed, nevertheless conventional controllers are not used in these situations because there is no controller which has compact structures and intuitively controls 3DOF position and 3DOF posture. In this research, we propose a remote controller \u201cArmrest Joystick\u201d of the Master-Slave system which has high portability and operability. The Armrest Joystick is attached to a foldable portable chair and can be carried easily. It consists of a 3DOF position controller with an armrest supporting the operator's arm during operations, a 3DOF posture controller and a gripper controller. Furthermore, it has motors for the force feedback on all axes for more intuitive operations. In this paper, we report the basic concept and design of the Armrest Joystick, and the experiments which verify operability and the validity of the force feedback.",

        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "Many robotics platforms are capable of ascending stairways, but all existing approaches for autonomous stair climbing use stairway detection as a trigger for immediate traversal. In the broader context of autonomous exploration, the ability to travel between floors of a building should be compatible with path planning, such that the robot can traverse a stairway at a time that is appropriate to its navigation goals. No system yet presented is capable of both localizing stairways on a map and estimating their properties, functions that in combination would enable stairways to be considered as traversable terrain in a path planning algorithm. We propose a method for modeling stairways as objects and localizing them on a map, such that they can be subsequently traversed if they are of dimensions that the robotic platform is capable of climbing. Our system consists of two parts: a computationally efficient detector that leverages geometric cues from depth imagery to detect sets of ascending stairs, and a stairway modeler that uses multiple detections to infer the location and parameters of a stairway that is discovered during exploration. This video demonstrates the performance of the system in a number of real-world situations, modeling and localizing a variety of stairway types in both indoor and outdoor environments.",

        "track": "main",
        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "Generation of grasps for automated object manipulation in cluttered scenarios presents major challenges for various modules of the pipeline such as 2D/3D visual processing, 3D modeling, grasp hypothesis generation, grasp planning and path planning. In this paper, we present a solution framework for solving a complex instance of the problem - represented by a heap of unknown and unstructured objects in a bounded environment - in our case, a box; with the goal being removing all objects in the box using an attention driven object modeling approach to cognitive grasp planning. The focus of the algorithm delves on Grasping by Components (GBC), with a prioritization scheme derived from scene based attention and attention driven segmentation. In order to overcome the traditional challenge of segmentation performing poorly in cluttered scenes, we employ a novel active segmentation approach suited to our scenario. While the attention module helps prioritize objects in the heap and salient regions, the GBC scheme segments out parts and generates grasp hypotheses for each part. GBC is a very important component of any scalable and holistic grasping system since it abstracts point cloud object data with parametric shapes and no apriori knowledge (such as 3D models) is required. Earlier work in 3D model building (such as CAD based, simple geometries, bounding boxes, Superquadrics etc.) have depended on precise shape and pose recognition as well as exhaustive training to learn or exhaustive searching in grasp space to generate good grasp hypotheses. These methods are not scalable for real-time scenarios, complex shapes and unknown environments - key challenges in robotic grasping. In order to alleviate this concern, we present a novel parametric algorithm to estimate grasp points and approach vectors from the 3D parametric shape model, along with innovative schemes to optimize the computation of the parametric models as well as to refine the generated grasp hypotheses based on t...

        "abstract": "This paper presents an augmented reality framework, implemented on the master console of a modified da Vinci\u00ae surgical robot, that enables the operator to design and implement assistive virtual fixtures during teleoperation. Our specific goal is to facilitate teleoperation with large time delays, such as the delay of several seconds that occurs with ground-based control of robotic systems in earth orbit. The virtual fixtures give immediate visual feedback and motion guidance to the operator, while the remote slave performs motions consistent with those constraints. This approach is suitable for tasks in unstructured environments, such as servicing of existing on-orbit spacecraft that were not designed for servicing. We conducted a pilot study by teleoperating a remote slave robot for a thermal barrier blanket cutting task using virtual fixtures with and without time delay. The results show that virtual fixtures reduce the time required to complete the task while also eliminating significant manipulation errors, such as tearing the blanket. The improvement in performance is especially dramatic when a simulated time delay (4 seconds) is introduced.",

In this paper, an automatic nanomanipulation system was proposed for single cell mechanical property characterization inside an environmental scanning electron microscopy (ESEM). A nanoneedle was fabricated from AFM (atomic force microscopy) cantilever by FIB (focused ion beam) etching technique. The nanoneedle was fixed to a nanorobotic manipulator, which has three degrees of freedom, i.e. X, Y and Z translation. Single yeast cell was put on an tungsten probe substrate inside ESEM. The position information of the nanoneedle and single cell were used as the feedback signals to control the movement of the nanorobotic manipulator. Finally, the stiffness of the single cell was measured using the nanoneedle driven by the automatic nanomanipulation system.",

While a single laser range finder (LRF) is sufficient for detecting and tracking persons on a mobile robot platform, a network of multiple LRF is required to observe persons in larger spaces. Calibrating multiple LRF into a global coordinate system is usually done by hand in a time consuming procedure. An automatic calibration mechanism for such a sensor network is introduced in this paper. Without the need of prior knowledge about the environment, this mechanism is able to obtain the positions and orientations of all LRF in a global coordinate system. By comparing person tracks, determined for each individual LRF unit and matching them, constrains between the LRF units can be calculated. We are able to estimate the poses of all LRF by resolving these constrains. We evaluate and compare our method to the current state of the art approach methodically and experimentally. Experiments show that our calibration approach outperforms this approach.",

We define a semantic map as an overhead, or bird's eye view of a region with associated semantic object labels, such as car, road and pavement. We formulate the problem using two conditional random fields. The first is used to model the semantic image segmentation of the street view imagery treating each image independently. The outputs of this stage are then aggregated over many images to form the input for our semantic map that is a second random field defined over a ground plane. Each image is related by a simple, yet effective, geometrical function that back projects a region from the street view image into the overhead ground plane map. We introduce, and make publicly available, a new dataset created from real world data. Our qualitative evaluation is performed on this data consisting of a 14.8 km track, and we also quantify our results on a representative subset.",

        "abstract": "In a soccer match, a cooperative behavior emerges from the combined execution of simple actions by players. A cooperative behavior can be planned if players are previously committed to its execution prior to its start or unplanned otherwise. The ability to reproduce some of these behaviors can be useful to help a team achieve better performances. This work presents an approach to identify and extract cooperative behaviors that start from set-pieces and lead to a goal while ball possession is kept. The representation of these behaviors is abstracted using a set-play definition language to promote their reusability. A set of game log files generated with the FC Portugal team and collected from the RoboCup 2010 2D simulated soccer competition were analyzed. The results achieved showed that 25% of the total goals scored originated from set-pieces which attests to the importance of performing this analysis. Several guidelines for the definition of future set-plays were also inferred. In the future, these behaviors shall be tested to infer which are capable of neutralizing an opponent's team strategy and maximize the creation of goal opportunities.",

        "abstract": "When soft robots act in new or unforeseen situations, uncertainty becomes a major challenge. Sensors might fail and the forward kinematics might become faulty if limbs are deformed. To meet this challenge, we propose a model that uses additional sensors in different modalities and provides a highly modular body model which can be easily adapted. Longterm sensor-blackout is covered by usage of multiple sensors in different modalities, while short term sensor-blackout is covered by the maintenance of state representations over time and the inclusion of a full forward and inverse model suitable for prediction and simulation. Even more, as the state is represented redundantly in multiple modalities, the system compares the estimates to detect changes in sensor noise or even sensor offsets and discards failing sensors. Finally, the highly modularized architecture of our representation simplifies the adaptation of the body model.",

Recently, sensor fusion systems such as combinations of cameras and laser sensors have become popular in the effort to ensure a general level of performance in this task. In this paper, we present a new homing method in a large-scale environment using a laser-camera fusion system. Instead of fusing data to form a single map builder, we adaptively select sensor data to handle environments which contain ambiguity. For autonomous homing, we propose a new mapping strategy for building a hybrid map and a return strategy for selecting the next target waypoints efficiently. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm enables the autonomous homing of a robot in a large-scale indoor environments in real time.",

        "abstract": "While humans can manipulate deformable objects smoothly and naturally, this is still a challenge for autonomous robots due to the complex object dynamics. The presence of rigid environment constraints and altering contact phases between the deformable object, the manipulator, and the environment makes this problem even more challenging. This paper presents a framework for deformable object manipulation that makes use of a single human demonstration of the task. The recorded trajectories are automatically segmented into a sequence of haptic control primitives involving contact with the rigid environment and vision-guided grasp primitives. The recorded motion/force trajectories serve as reference for a compliant control scheme in contact situations. In order to cope with positioning uncertainties a variable admittance control is proposed. The proposed approach is validated in an experimental mounting task for a deformable linear object with multiple re-grasping. The task is demonstrated with a multimodal teleoperation system and transfered to a robotic platform with a pair of seven degrees of freedom manipulators.",

        "abstract": "In the last years, several regression algorithms have been proposed to learn accurate mechanical models of robots. Comparisons are proposed at the conceptual level or through the use of recorded databases, but they deliver limited conclusions with respect to the real performance of these algorithms in their true context of use, i.e. online learning on the real robot interacting with its environment, within a feedback control loop. In this paper, we provide an empirical study of three state-of-the-art regression methods through online learning on the iCub robot holding a tool. We show that they can effectively learn a visuo-motor kinematic model for a simple visual servoing task in a very limited time (few minutes), without making any a priori hypothesis on the geometry of the robot and its tool. Furthermore, we can draw from the results some stronger conclusions about the comparison of the algorithms than previous studies based on databases.",

The goal is to provide a natural, concise grammar for specifying high-level tasks that require remembering past events, and to ensure that the required memory is correctly updated during controller execution. To this end, a structured English grammar for specifying high level behavior is provided that automatically performs memory operations, without requiring explicit definition from the specification designer. This grammar admits intuitive, unambiguous specifications for tasks that implicitly use memory for purposes including non-repeated goals, strictly ordered action sequences, etc. The proposed framework also guarantees the correctness of memory operations during continuous execution. The approach is implemented within the LTLMoP toolkit for reactive mission planning.",

The proposed approach encodes point information as a binary string providing a descriptor that is suitable for applications that demand speed performance and low memory consumption. Results of several experiments demonstrate that as far as precision and robustness are concerned, BRAND achieves improved results when compared to state of the art descriptors based on texture, geometry and combination of both information. We also demonstrate that our descriptor is robust and provides reliable results in a registration task even when a sparsely textured and poorly illuminated scene is used.",

        "abstract": "One of the concerns in vehicle steering controls regards how to manipulate a vehicle to follow a designated path accurately. Generally, this issue is usually solved by linear or nonlinear control techniques based exclusively on vehicle kinematics or on a solution that partially combines dynamics. In this paper, an integral robust multi-tiered model-based vehicle steering control strategy is proposed in order to consider both kinematics and dynamics simultaneously. In this strategy, the kinematic controller provides yaw rate commands to converge the vehicle to a designated path by tuning an embedded sliding surface based on vehicle capability. To minimize steady-state errors caused by path curvature discontinuity, integral control is also applied. A robust dynamic controller is designed to reject modeling errors and disturbances caused by side slip angle from robust observer estimations. Steering rate is implemented to consider steering actuator capabilities and to smooth steering commands. Simulations and experiments validate control performance with a full-size passenger vehicle.",

We chose microbes belonging to Corynebacterium group as samples. First, as preparing for using the microfluidic device, we experimentally deduced effective DEP frequency of 10 MHz, when live C. glutamicum was preferably driven to the areas with stronger electric fields. Second, we characterized the microfluidic device and found that the device could immobilize microbes into micro pores and evaluate the production capacity of a single bacrerium.

        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "The formation of categories, which constitutes the basis of developing concepts, requires multimodal information with a complex structure. We propose a model called the bag of multimodal hierarchical Dirichlet processes (BoMHDP), which enables robots to form a variety of multimodal categories. The BoMHDP model is a collection of a large number of MHDP models, each of which has a different set of weights for sensory information. The weights work to realize selective attention and enable the formation of various types of categories (e.g., object, haptic, and color). The BoMHDP model is an extension of the HDP, and categorization is unsupervised. However, categories that are not natural for humans are also formed. Therefore, only the significant categories are selected through interaction between the user and the robot. At the same time, words obtained during the interaction are connected to the categories. Finally, categories, which are represented by words, are selected. The BoMHDP model was implemented on a robot platform and a preliminary experiment was conducted to validate it. The results revealed that various categories can be formed with the BoMHDP model. We also analyzed the formed conceptual structure by using multidimensional scaling. The results indicate that the complex conceptual structure was represented reasonably well with the BoMHDP model.",

        "abstract": "Environmental Monitoring (EM) is typically performed using sensor networks that collect measurements in predefined static locations. The possibility of having one or more autonomous robots to perform this task increases versatility and reduces the number of necessary sensor nodes to cover the same area. However, several problems arise when making use of autonomous moving robots for EM. The main challenges are how to build an accurate spatial-temporal model while choosing locations for measuring the phenomenon. This paper addresses the problem by using Bayesian Optimisation for choosing sensing locations, and presents a new utility function that takes into account the distance travelled by a moving robot. The proposed methodology is tested in simulation and in a real environment. Compared to existing strategies, our approach exhibits slightly better accuracy in terms of RMSE error and considerably reduces the total distance travelled by the robot.",

        "abstract": "This paper presents a novel method for Bayesian bearing-only tracking. Unlike the classical approaches, which involve using Gaussian distribution, the tracking procedure is completely covered with the von Mises distribution, including state representation, transitional probability, and measurement model, since it captures and models well the peculiarities of directional data. The state is represented with a mixture of von Mises distributions, thus offering advantages of being able to model multimodal distributions, handle nonlinear state transition and measurement models, and to completely cover the whole state space, all with a modest number of parameters. The tracking procedure is solved by convolution with a von Mises distribution (prediction step) and multiplication with a mixture representing the measurement model (update step). Since in the update step the number of mixture components grows exponentially, a method is presented for component reduction of a von Mises mixture. Furthermore, a closed-form solution is derived for quadratic R\u00e9nyi entropy of the von Mises mixture. The algorithm is tested and compared to a particle filter representation in a speaker tracking scenario on a synthetic data set and real-world recordings. The results supported the proposed approach and showed similar performance to the particle filter.",

As these control laws can be designed to accomplish different tasks, the robot is able to use the presented framework to tune the parameters online to achieve desirable results. Moreover, we build on switch-time optimization techniques to allow the model predictive control framework to optimize over a series of given behaviors, allowing for an added level of adaptability.

        "abstract": "Assistive robots are increasingly being envisioned as an aid to the elderly and disabled. However controlling a robotic system with a potentially large amount of Degrees of Freedom (DOF) in a safe and reliable way is not an easy task, even without limitations in the mobility of the upper extremities. Shared control has been proposed as a way of aiding disabled users in controlling mobility aids such as assistive wheelchairs, by using the sensors of the robotic platform to predict the user's intent and assist in navigation. Assistive manipulators, that aim to perform physical Daily Life Activities (DLA), is a more complex problem however. This calls for good experimental practices to ensure repeatability, reproducibility, and steady progress. The work presented here attempts to model the complete system for assistive manipulators, and in the context of this model define metrics and good practices for benchmarking shared control for such robots. An adaptive shared control approach for limiting collisions during teleoperation is used as a case study. Improvements in performance are shown, quantified by the trade-off between mean time and number of collisions as well as the controllability from the user's perspective.",

This research investigates the feasibility and effectiveness of applying tau theory principles for guiding some crucial maneuvers of Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UAS) such as braking, automated aerial docking, automatic landing and moving target interception. The developed TauPilot includes a tau-Guidance system, a tau-Navigation system and a tau-Controller, resulting in 4D (time as the fourth dimension) GN&C system that has the capability to accurately fit maneuvers or actions into 4D slots using only a universal temporal variable tau. TauPilot has been integrated into two rotorcraft UAS and demonstrated in more than one thousand (about 1114) successful tau-controlled flights.",

This single arm model is then validated against live octopus data and expanded to an 8-arm system. Appropriate coordination algorithms of the eight arms result in crawling locomotion.

        "abstract": "Hovering flies are capable of achieving outstanding performances when hovering above flowers for several minutes. A new insect-based hovering control strategy is presented here for accurately stabilizing the position of a sighted twin-rotor equipped with a decoupled eye with a narrow field-of-view of only a few degrees. The main aim of this paper is to describe how accurately hovering flight above a target can be achieved by means of this fundamental bio-inspired mechanical decoupling system between the eye and the body. The simulated gaze control system implemented on-board the aerial robot has several advantages : - it enables the robot's gaze to be stabilized on the basis of three bio-inspired oculomotor reflexes (ORs) : a visual fixation reflex (VFR), a translational reflex and a rotational vestibulo-ocular reflex (tVOR and rVOR), - it makes the eye compensate quickly and accurately for any sudden, untoward disturbances caused by the vagaries of the supporting head or body, - it provides a reference visual signal to compensate for the rate gyro drift used to implement the VORs and to stabilize the hovering robot, - it greatly improves the stability of the robot's roll during voluntary lateral displacements with respect to the target. Close comparisons were made between two simulated robots with and without a decoupled eye, which were both subjected to strong lateral and roll disturbances. The simulations show that the robot with a decoupled eye can reject disturbances twice as fast as that with a fixed eye. This innovative bio-inspired hovering control method stabilizes the robot's attitude without any need for accelerometers, magnetometers or classical inertial measurement units.",

        "abstract": "In this paper, we investigate the feasibility of building a visual memory for robotics spatial cognition without saving visual information. The proposed approach captures some properties of primate brain and especially the view cells. Our bio-inspired visual memory for cognitive map building consists of two main parts. One part is visual information extraction and the other part is the visual memory building using the Fuzzy Art architecture. The results of the current study could contribute to the development of bio-inspired model for cognitive map building which enables the mobile robot to localize itself and build a cognitive representation of its environment simultaneously like primates and humans.",

        "abstract": "Insects, e.g. cockroaches and stick insects, have found fascinating solutions for the problem of locomotion, especially climbing over a large variety of obstacles. Research on behavioral neurobiology has identified key behavioral patterns of these animals (i.e., body flexion, center of mass elevation, and local leg reflexes) necessary for climbing. Inspired by this finding, we develop a neural control mechanism for hexapod robots which generates basic walking behavior and especially enables them to effectively perform reactive climbing behavior. The mechanism is composed of three main neural circuits: locomotion control, reactive backbone joint control, and local leg reflex control. It was developed and tested using a physical simulation environment, and was then successfully transferred to a physical six-legged walking machine, called AMOS II. Experimental results show that the controller allows the robot to overcome obstacles of various heights (e.g., \u223c 75% of its leg length, which are higher than those that other comparable legged robots have achieved so far). The generated climbing behavior is also comparable to the one observed in cockroaches.",

        "abstract": "A novel biped control is proposed. Since it doesn't require referential motion trajectories defined by time, it can achieve longitudinal walking which is flexible enough to follow an arbitrary referential velocity given at random timing and to cope with unexpected external forces. The controller is developed based on the dynamics morphing, which is a framework to enable seamless transitions between various motions by continuously morphing the dynamical structure of the feedback system. Thus, it is compatible with the standing, the stepping-out for emergency, and so forth. Three key techniques are (i) morphing from the standing stabilizer with a stable equilibrium point to the velocity-follower which lacks any equilibrium points, (ii) a foot control maneuver which is automatically activated together with the morphing into the velocity following control, and (iii) automatic update of the referential position of COM for safety when going back to the standing stabilization. Although it is based on the same principle with the simulated regulator proposed by the author, the proposed controller is advantageous to it as it doesn't require an additional automaton to update the referential position of COM. The idea was examined through interactive computer simulations.",

Data from human running experiments are processed, analyzed and split into the two domains: stance phase and flight phase. By examining this data, we present a set of outputs, i.e., functions of the kinematics, which appear to represent human running; moreover, we show that this output data can be described by the time-solution to a linear spring-mass-damper\u2014termed the canonical locomotion function. This observation motivates the construction of a human-inspired optimization that determines the parameters of the canonical locomotion function that provide the best fit of the human data while simultaneously enforcing partial hybrid zero dynamics, i.e., that the human outputs track the canonical locomotion functions even through impacts. The main result is a method for numerically solving this optimization problem that provably results in stable robotic running. Simulation results are presented that demonstrate the \u201chuman-like\u201d robotic running obtained through this procedure.",

In this paper, a multi-target visual tracking system that incorporates object detection with the Gaussian mixture PHD filter is developed. The main contribution of this paper is to propose a new birth intensity online estimation method that based on the entropy distribution and the coverage rate. First, the birth intensity is initialized by using the previously obtained targets' states and measurements. The measurements are obtained by object detection and classified into the birth measurements and the survival measurements. Then it is updated according to the currently obtained birth measurements. In the update stage, the instability of the entropy distribution is applied to remove components like noises within the birth intensity which are irrelevant with the currently obtained birth measurements. And the coverage rate between each birth intensity component and corresponding birth measurement is computed to further eliminate the noises. Finally, experiments are implemented to show the performance of the proposed visual tracking system, especially to show the good performance for tracking the newborn targets.",

Generating optimal grasps depends on the position of contact points as much as the configuration of the robot hand and it would hence be desirable to solve this in a single step. This paper takes advantage of new development in non-linear optimization and formulates the problem of grasp synthesis as a single constrained optimization problem, generating grasps that are at the same time feasible for the hand's kinematics and optimal according to a force related quality measure. The approach is validated on the 9 degrees of freedom hand of the iCub humanoid robot.",

        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "The control of tendon-driven and, in particular, of anthropomimetic robots using techniques from traditional robotics remains a very challenging task [1, 2]. Hence, we previously proposed to employ physics-based simulation engines to simulate the complex dynamics of this emerging class of robots [3] and to use the simulation model as an internal model for robot control [4]. This approach, however, relies on an accurate model to be successful. In this paper, we present the automated, steady-state pose calibration of a physics-based, anthropomimetic robot model using a (\u03bc, \u03bb)-Evolution Strategy. For the acquisition of the poses of the physical robot, a stereo-vision, infrared-marker based motion capture system with real-time capabilities was developed. The employed (\u03bc, \u03bb)-Evolution Strategy uses a Gaussian-based, non-isotropic, self-adapting mutation operator to explore the search space and reduce the simulation-reality gap. The obtained results are impressive, resulting in a reduction of joint angle errors in the range of one to two orders of magnitude and an absolute joint angle error of 0.5\u00b0\u20134.5\u00b0 per pose evaluated.",

        "abstract": "In this paper, we describe a system that enables a low-cost quadrocopter coupled with a ground-based laptop to navigate autonomously in previously unknown and GPS-denied environments. Our system consists of three components: a monocular SLAM system, an extended Kalman filter for data fusion and state estimation and a PID controller to generate steering commands. Next to a working system, the main contribution of this paper is a novel, closed-form solution to estimate the absolute scale of the generated visual map from inertial and altitude measurements. In an extensive set of experiments, we demonstrate that our system is able to navigate in previously unknown environments at absolute scale without requiring artificial markers or external sensors. Furthermore, we show (1) its robustness to temporary loss of visual tracking and significant delays in the communication process, (2) the elimination of odometry drift as a result of the visual SLAM system and (3) accurate, scale-aware pose estimation and navigation.",

        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "Many robotic systems combine cameras with Laser Rangefinders (LRF) for simultaneously achieving multi-purpose visual sensing and accurate depth recovery. Employing a single sensor modality for accomplishing both goals is an appealing proposition because it enables substantial savings in equipment, and tends to decrease the overall complexity of the system. This article explores the possibility of replacing LRF by passive stereo vision for reconstructing the scene along a 2D scan plane. We present a new stereo algorithm that is specifically tailored for the purpose. The algorithm recovers the depth along the scan plane using a symmetry-based matching cost (SymStereo), and refines the raw estimates by applying dynamic programming, followed by a Markov Random Field (MRF) that decides if the reconstructed contour is a line or not. We report for the first time comparative experiments between Stereo Rangefinding (SRF) and LRF. The results are encouraging by showing that SRF can be a plausible alternative to LRF in several application scenarios. Moreover, since SRF also enables independent depth estimates along multiple scan planes with arbitrary orientation, being the only constraint that the scan plane intersects the stereo baseline, it is an important benefit that can be decisive for many robotic applications.",

        "track": "main",
        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "Tendon-driven mechanisms are one of the most popular mechanisms for transmitting force and power from a distance. The energy efficiency of a tendon-driven system can be improved if it can maintain the actuation force while not moving, without mechanical work. This can be achieved by using a brake. A brake without an additional actuator is preferred for achieving compactness of the entire system. We present a novel passive brake mechanism - the capstan brake, which consists of a capstan, rollers, and one-way clutches. The friction between the capstan and tendon amplifies a small resisting force (originating from an inactivated motor) to gain enough brake force. Because no additional actuator is involved, no energy is consumed to generate the brake force. In addition, the one-way clutch enables the capstan to rotate in the winding direction. Therefore, the brake force is only exerted when needed, and the performance of the entire device does not decrease owing to the use of the capstan brake. The brake force of the system is limited to handling the safety issues. If the external load exceeds the maximum brake force, the brake becomes back-drivable again. The limit level can be controlled by changing the number of times the tendon is wound around the capstan. Another issue for a tendon-driven system is that the tendon escapes from a spooler when the tendon does not maintain proper tension. By implementing the rollers with the capstan brake, the tendon cannot escape from a spooler even though the tendon is not pulled by an external load in all actuating situations. The performance of the proposed brake mechanism was evaluated through several tests. The results showed that the capstan brake is suitable to be applied to the wearable robotic hand, which is one of the prospective applications of the brake. The force loss caused by the brake was negligible and the brake operated properly even though the tendon was not pulled by an external load in all actuating situations. Show More",

Second, to minimize the resistance caused by the tether, a tapered case for the storage is proposed, expected to mitigate the friction between the tether and the case and to prevent the twist on the tether. Third, the way of anchoring the end of the cast tube is proposed.

        "abstract": "Minimally invasive endovascular procedures including robotically assisted intervention require effective intraoperative guidance. This is mainly achieved through intraoperative imaging such as fluoroscopy. Concerns over excessive x-ray radiation and nephrotoxicity due to repeated injection of contrast agents have motivated the development of effective catheter navigation schemes based on limited imaging data. This paper presents a catheter navigation technique based on probabilistic fusion of in situ real-time electromagnetic tracking with physically-based simulation of the mechanical characteristics of the catheter. A catheter with multiple electromagnetic sensors placed along its length has been developed. The sensor data and the catheter insertion-length are used as the boundary condition for determining the shape and position of the catheter within the vasculature. A probabilistic framework based on a Kalman Filter is used to combine the information from the catheter motion algorithm and the electromagnetic tracking data. This provides continuous visualization of the catheter within the lumen without the need of continuous fluoroscopy and contrast injection. The proposed approach has been validated with detailed in vitro experiments demonstrating the potential clinical application of the technique.",

        "abstract": "In this paper, a method suitable for distinguishing between different materials occurring in natural scenes using a multi-spectral camera is devised. Such a capability is useful in autonomous robot applications to help negotiating the environment as well as, e.g. applications intended to create large scale inventories of assets in the proximity of roads. The utilised sensor records a seven band multi-spectral image, of which six bands are in the visible range and one in the NIR (near-infrared) range. Many materials appearing similar if viewed by a common RGB camera, will show discriminating properties if viewed by a camera capturing a greater number of separated wavelengths. The approach in this paper is to combine the discriminating strength of the multi-spectral signature in each pixel and the corresponding nature of the surrounding texture. Local features, considering seven bands in each pixel and texture features such as GLCM and Fourier spectrum features are exploited to make the system more robust to different lighting conditions. Then classifiers built using SVM and AdaBoost are evaluated with very promising results, an average classification accuracy of 91.9% and 89.1%, respectively for a ten class problem.",

        "abstract": "Modern robotic platforms, deployed for environmental monitoring and mapping, are able to rapidly accumulate large data sets. Whilst the data sets collected by these platforms are highly descriptive, they are often too large for human experts to analyse exhaustively. Although the large data sets could be analysed by humans in principle, the amount of labour and time required to process them is not cost effective. In this paper we focus on the classification task of learning the relationship between low resolution, remotely sensed data and categories derived from direct observations of the same phenomenon. To reduce the labour requirements of categorising the direct observations we forgo human supervision and rely on an unsupervised clustering model to segregate the observations into similar groups of data. Rather than using the discrete cluster labels to train a conventional classifier, we develop a new Gaussian process classifier capable of accepting probabilistic training targets. This allows the probabilistic information generated during clustering to be preserved during classification. We demonstrate the new model, in an environmental monitoring application, using data collected by an autonomous underwater vehicle.",

        "abstract": "Vertical climbing on a variety of flat surfaces with a single robot has been previously demonstrated using vacuum suction, electrostatic adhesion, and biologically inspired approaches, etc. These methods generally have a low attachment strength, and it is not clear whether they can provide satisfactory attachment on vertical terrains with richer 3D features. Recent development of a climbing technology based on hot melt adhesives (HMAs) has shown its advantage with a high attachment strength through thermal bonding and viability to any solid surfaces. However, its feasibility for vertical climbing has only been proven on flat surfaces and with external energy supplies. This paper provides quantitative measurements for vertical climbing performance on five types of surfaces and terrains with a self-contained robot exploiting HMAs. We show that robust vertical climbing on multiple terrains can be achieved with reliable high-strength attachment.",

Motivated by the success of manifold learning for visual recognition, we present a novel clustering-based discriminative locality alignment (CDLA) algorithm to discover the low-dimensional intrinsic submanifold from the embedding high-dimensional ambient space for improving the face gender recognition performance. In particular, CDLA exploits the global geometry through k-means clustering, extracts the discriminative information through margin maximization and explores the local geometry through intra cluster sample concentration. These three properties uniquely characterize CDLA for face gender recognition. The experimental results obtained from the FERET data sets suggest the superiority of the proposed method in terms of recognition speed and accuracy by comparing with several representative methods.",

        "abstract": "Controllers for articulated robots such as an arm or a humanoid commonly need to continuously calculate complex algebraic quantities, such as the joint space inertia matrix or Jacobians. An effective and fast implementation of the calculation of these quantities is crucial to achieve complex, yet robust controllers and thus enable sophisticated behaviors in robots. Although the nature of these algebraic quantities is very well known in robotics, they do not lend themselves easily to manual implementation, because of ambiguities and the complexity in their development and use. We propose an approach that addresses this issue by relying on automatic code generation, thus relieving the user from hand crafted development. Our approach also addresses efficiency and speed, in order to satisfy the strict requirements of real time robot controllers, yet it is easy to use. We show the effectiveness of our method by means of some preliminary comparisons.",

This video presents a cost-effective invisible sensitive skin that can cover a large area without utilizing a large number of sensors and it is built inside the robot arm. By using only 5 contactless capacitive sensors and specially designed antennas, collision avoidance of a 6-DOF industrial robot arm is attained.",

Current positions and velocities of surrounding robots are translated to an efficient geometric representation to determine safe motions. Each robot uses on-board localization and local communication to build the velocity obstacle representation of its surroundings. Our close and error-bounded convex approximation of the localization density distribution results in collision-free paths under uncertainty. While in many algorithms the robots are approximated by circumscribed radii, we use the convex hull to minimize the overestimation in the footprint. Results show that our approach allows for safe navigation even in densely packed environments.",

We map and localize in an unknown environment, where the access points' locations are unspecified and for which training data is a priori unavailable. Our approach is based on an heterogeneous method combining robots with different sensor payloads. The algorithmic design assumes the ability of producing a map in real-time from a sensor-full robot that can quickly be shared by sensor-deprived robot team members. More specifically, we cast WiFi localization as classification and regression problems that we subsequently solve using machine learning techniques. In order to produce a robust system, we take advantage of the spatial and temporal information inherent in robot motion by running Monte Carlo Localization on top of our regression algorithm, greatly improving its effectiveness. A significant amount of experiments are performed and presented to prove the accuracy, effectiveness, and practicality of the algorithm.",

The proposed method is hands-free as it uses a microphone array to acquire the sound. A particularity of the approach is the use of a laser range finder based human tracker system. The human tracker monitors the locations of people then local steered response power is used to detect the people speaking and localize precisely their mouths. Then an audio stream is created for each person and used to perform speaker identification. Experimental results show that the use of the human tracker has several benefits compared to an audio only approach.",

        "abstract": "Autonomous grasping of unknown objects by a robot is a highly challenging skill that is receiving increasing attention in the last years. This problem becomes still more challenging (and less explored) in underwater environments, with highly unstructured scenarios, limited availability of sensors and, in general, adverse conditions that affect in different degree the robot perception and control systems. This paper describes an approach for semi-autonomous grasping and recovery on underwater unknown objects from floating vehicles. A laser stripe emitter is attached to a robot forearm that performs a scan of a target of interest. This scan is captured by a camera that also estimates the motion of the floating vehicle while doing the scan. The scanned points are triangulated and transformed according to the motion estimation, thus recovering partial 3D structure of the scene with respect to a fixed frame. A user then indicates the part where to grab the object, and the final grasp is automatically planned on that area. The approach herein presented is tested and validated in water tank conditions.",

We provide communication via controlled placement of router vehicles that relay messages from any sensor to any other sensor in the system under the assumptions of 1) no cooperation from the sensors, and 2) only sensor-router or router-router communication over a maximum distance of R is reliable. We provide a formal framework and design provable exact and approximate (faster) algorithms for finding optimal router vehicle locations that are updated according to sensor movement. Using vehicle limitations, such as bounded control effort and maximum velocities of the sensors, our algorithm approximates areas that each router can reach while preserving connectivity and returns an expiration time window over which these positions are guaranteed to maintain communication of the entire system. The expiration time is compared against computation time required to update positions as a decision variable for choosing either the exact or approximate solution for maintaining connectivity with the sensors on-line.",

These techniques are categorized into five main groups: Sliding mode ESC, neural network ESC, approximation based ESC, perturbation based ESC and adaptive ESC. These groups are explained briefly by stressing their working principles and the effect of the parameters. Then, the techniques are compared with respect to their robustness to noise and system dynamics by simulations. In conclusion, we propose the usage of the approximation based methods when the noise level is negligible. When noise is present, the neural network based optimizers are a better choice thanks to their hysteresis functions. However, if the system has both high noise and dynamic effects, then the perturbation based method is preferable since large motions provide robustness to noise and smooth references generated by the algorithm are less likely to cause instability. An application example is also given on texture density maximization.",

Unfortunately, obtaining the required information with sufficient accuracy and precision can be difficult, motivating the search for alternative approaches. COBA is an online stiffness estimation algorithm based on force data only, that does not require position information. In this paper, we compare the results of position-based stiffness estimation algorithms with those obtained by COBA. Both simulation and experimental results were collected and analysed. We find that, by not requiring position data, COBA avoids some problems that can negatively affect the performance of position-based algorithms. This demonstrates the usefulness of force-based stiffness estimation techniques for adaptive force control techniques.",

The gait exploits the compliance difference between the two sides of the tripods, to generate clockwise or counter clockwise rotation by controlling the acceleration of the robot. The direction of turning depends on the configuration of the legs -tripod left of right- and the direction of the acceleration. Alternating acceleration in successive steps allows for continuous rotation in the desired direction. An analysis of the locomotion is presented as a function of the mechanical properties of the robot and the contact with the surface. A numerical simulation was performed for various conditions of locomotion. The results of the simulation and analysis were compared and found to be in excellent match.",

        "abstract": "In this paper, we introduce a further optimization of morphology of compliant joint based on FEM analysis for a compliant-parallel mechanism with a wide working area and a high accuracy. Compliant-parallel mechanism is the mechanism that all joints are composed by compliant joints in a parallel structure. In the integration of compliant and parallel mechanism, the motion of compliant joints can be guided by mechanical constraints from the parallel structure; thus the mechanism can be precisely driven. However, since compliant joints generally have a limited working area due to limitation in their structural deformation, the working area is commonly limited in micrometer-scale. Designing the compliant joints within a wide range of working area presents us a new challenge: the joints should be elastic for the desired direction, but also rigid for non-desired direction to be deformed. From these requirements, the morphology of the compliant joint was optimized by FEM analysis, and newly serially layered-flat spring compliant joint was developed. The developed compliant joint was implemented on a parallel mechanism as a high precision micro-assembly system for optical components. The prototype enabled 50\u00d750\u00d75 mm of working area within 0.71 mm of repeatable accuracy. From these results, the effectiveness of the morphological optimization for compliant joint was shown.",

        "abstract": "This paper illustrates the fabrication and characterization of a footpad based on an original principle of volumetric displacement sensing. It is intended for use in detecting ground contact forces in a running quadrupedal robot. The footpad is manufactured as a monolithic, composite structure composed of multi-graded polymers which are reinforced by glass fiber to increase durability and traction. The volumetric displacement sensing principle utilizes a hyperelastic gel-like pad with embedded magnets that are tracked with Hall-effect sensors. Normal and shear forces can be detected as contact with the ground which causes the gel-like pad to deform into rigid wells. This is all done without the need to expose the sensor. A one-time training process using an artificial neural network was used to relate the normal and shear forces with the volumetric displacement sensor output. The sensor was shown to predict normal forces in the Z-axis up to 80N with a root mean squared error of 6.04% as well as the onset of shear in the X and Y-axis. This demonstrates a proof-of-concept for a more robust footpad sensor suitable for use in all outdoor conditions.",

We focus our study on capillaries that have opened fenestrations when the integrity of the endothelial barrier is perturbed by tumors. We identified three different categories of governing parameters: geometrical (radius and length of nanocapsules); biophysical (ligand-to-receptor surface density ratio; non-specific interaction parameter) and biological (ligandreceptor binding affinity). It was demonstrated from MD simulations that the optimized size was for CNTs with dimensions greater than for 20 to 200 nm. Finally, the simulation results show that the superparamagnetic nanorobotic capsules were able to cross the endothelial barrier by using magnetic forces compatible with medical constraints.",

Furthermore, achieving the smooth and natural movements of humans has become a hot topic in robotics, especially when robots are supposed to work in close proximity to humans. The anthropomimetic principle aims at mimicking not only the outside but also the inner mechanisms of the human body in humanoid robots. However, for this class of robots there exist as yet no scalable controllers that might make it possible to control a full body, or even several joints. A very similar problem is ongoing research in biomechanics which is the computation of muscle excitation patterns for coordinated movements. For this purpose, biomechanicists have developed computed muscle control which has proven a very scalable technique. In this paper, we demonstrate the adaptation of computed muscle control for a tendon-driven robot, comparing different methods for obtaining the muscle kinematics, as well as different low-level controllers. Results are shown for the implementation on a distributed control architecture and a single revolute elbow joint.",

In this study, we propose an integrated system which has ability to track multiple people at the same time, to recognize their facial expressions, and to identify social atmosphere. Consequently, robots can easily recognize facial expression, emotion variations of different people, and can respond properly. In our facial expression recognition scheme, we fuse Feature Vectors based Approach (FVA) and Differential-Active Appearance Model Features based Approach (DAFA) to obtain not only apposite positions of feature points, but also more information about texture and appearance. With the obtained useful information, FVA can classify the emotions according to comparison with the distances and ratios of feature points, and DAFA can distinguish emotions from classical machine learning on a low dimensional manifold space. Furthermore, emotion recognition of multiple people at the same time is extended. Based on the proposed algorithm, multiple person emotion analysis and social atmosphere identification can be achieved, which makes the relationship between people and robots much closer. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed algorithms can recognize facial expressions accurately and robustly. The ambient atmosphere identification system is implemented with a young Einstein robot head in our laboratory.",

The stability of the method is shown with numeric simulations. We evaluate how well this model describes the BHA by using real-world position measurements as quantitative ground truth and find a good match between model and real BHA, with only 1% relative error.

        "abstract": "The combination of task and motion planning presents us with a new problem that we call geometric backtracking. This problem arises from the fact that a single symbolic state or action may be geometrically instantiated in infinitely many ways. When a symbolic action cannot be geometrically validated, we may need to backtrack in the space of geometric configurations, which greatly increases the complexity of the whole planning process. In this paper, we address this problem using intervals to represent geometric configurations, and constraint propagation techniques to shrink these intervals according to the geometric constraints of the problem. After propagation, either (i) the intervals are shrunk, thus reducing the search space in which geometric backtracking may occur, or (ii) the constraints are inconsistent, indicating the non-feasibility of the sequence of actions without further effort. We illustrate our approach on scenarios in which a two-arm robot manipulates a set of objects, and report experiments that show how the search space is reduced.",

The dynamic is a characteristic of category hierarchies which can facilitate an important cognitive ability, the discovering of novel categories. We develop a constrained hierarchical latent Dirichlet allocation to build accurate category hierarchies. We employ object attributes as features to describe objects, which can transfer knowledge across categories and can efficiently describe novel categories. By combining them in the novel framework, novel visual object categories can be efficiently discovered and described. Extensive experiments based on PASCAL VOC 2008 and the LabelMe image database show the satisfactory performance of the proposed framework.",

Three-dimensional (3D) information obtained with a sensor is important for a robot that grasps an object. Sensors attached to robots for measurement are often hindered by occlusion by the hand immediately before an object is grasped. The constructed sensor is compact enough to be attached to a robot's hand, and occlusion can thus be avoided Compactness of the sensor is achieved by using a small CMOS camera and a laser projector and setting the baseline length between them as short as possible. The short baseline length also enables measurement in a short distance. Some experiments verify that the constructed sensor obtains accurate 3D information of objects in a short distance.",

        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "Typical deflection sensors like strain gauges or devices based on optical fibers require physical contact with the deflected substrate during the measurement process. Such contact, however, impacts on the softness of the substrate and may falsify the measurements. In order to overcome this drawback, a novel method of contactless deflection sensing was proposed in a recent work. It was verified that the deflection angle between two planes can be extracted using only a photosensor and a light source bearing a bell-shape angular emission profile. Yet, the range of operation was limited to concave shapes. In this paper, we introduce an alternative configuration of this light-based deflection sensing method to extend its functionality to convex surfaces. Here, a spheroidal mirror bearing a customized profile is introduced above the light source. This mirror redirects part of the emitted light towards the photosensor occluded by the bending surface during convex deflections.We make use of a ray tracing simulation method to design the mirror profiles, which are accurately reproduced in the manufactured prototypes by tuning the fabrication variables of the manufacturing process. Using a shape-sensing prototype, it is verified that the use of the mirror extends the range of detectable deflections by 55\u00b0 to convex bendings, yielding a deviation of only 8.3% from simulated results. Our deflection sensing solution is a promising method to be used as a shape sensor in numerous applications, such as soft robotics platforms or prosthetic devices.",

        "abstract": "This paper introduces a context-aware assisted active robotic walker for Parkinson's disease (PD) patients. Most of PD patients suffer from not only loss of balance but also abnormal gaits. These symptoms tend to make PD patients fall down more easily and result in low quality of life. We use Hidden Markov Model (HMM) to analyze the gait of PD patients, and then use our walker to help patients adjust their gait to become normal while applying auditory cues when abnormal gaits are recognized. To prevent user from leaning forward before falling down, the walker locks the motors when sudden forward pushing by the user is detected. Moreover, the walker can record the statics of gait from the user, making the therapists monitor the rehabilitation process relatively easier. Finally, the road conditions in front of the walker will be automatically analyzed, making user able to adjust his/her walking pace dynamically. To our best knowledge, the hereby proposed active robotic walker should be the first system which can provide walking aid to PD patients. In our experiments, the feasibility and performance of this system are evaluated by PD patients at two actual senior care units.",

For home energy saving based on context-awareness, human activity is critical information since knowing what activities are undertaken is important for judging if energy consumed by appliances is well spent by users. Such contextual information is an important clue for providing an energy saving service. However, most of the prior works on home energy saving often ignore those appliances which are operating indirectly or implicitly related to the context. These factors may compromise the practicality and acceptability of most of the currently available energy saving systems, thus failing to meet real user needs. Therefore, we propose utilizing an Energy-Prone Context to model a context and its associated energy consumption. In addition, we also propose a systematic method to determine energy-saving services based on the Energy-Prone Contexts. Our experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.",

        "abstract": "Various advanced driver assistance systems (ADASs) have recently been developed, such as Adaptive Cruise Control and Precrash Safety System. However, most ADASs can operate in only some driving situations because of the difficulty of recognizing contextual information. For closer cooperation between a driver and vehicle, the vehicle should recognize a wider range of situations, similar to that recognized by the driver, and assist the driver with appropriate timing. In this paper, we assumed a double articulation structure in driving behavior data and segmented driving behavior into meaningful chunks for driving scene recognition in a similar manner to natural language processing (NLP). A double articulation analyzer translated the driving behavior into meaningless manemes, which are the smallest units of the driving behavior just like phonemes in NLP, and from them it constructed navemes, which are meaningful chunks of driving behavior just like morphemes. As a result of this two-phase analysis, we found that driving chunks equivalent to language words were closer to the complicated or contextual driving scene segmentation produced by human recognition.",

Initially, we make use of a pattern generator to synthesize dynamically-consistent running trajectories in which the rotational inertia and the associated angular momentum term are characterized. As for the controller, ground reaction force constraints are imposed to the system indirectly. For this purpose, joint torque values that are corresponding to horizontal and vertical force errors are computed. Subsequently, they are inserted to an admittance filter block to obtain the associated joint displacements. These joint displacements are then fed-back to local servo controllers to implement indirect force feedback control in an actively compliant manner. Additionally, friction compensation and foot orientation controller blocks are added to enhance the system performance. In order to validate the method, running experiments are conducted on the actual one-legged robot. As the result, we satisfactorily obtained continuous, dynamically equilibrated and repetitive running cycles.",

        "abstract": "This paper presents tracking algorithms of a mobile robot that tracks a human in front. The mobile robot, which is a differential-driven wheel type, is equipped with a laser range finder to perform human tracking in front. Initially, we recommend the torso part for the robust tracking of the human body in outdoor environment by a laser range finder. To track a human in front, we define a virtual target determined by the velocity of the target human. For a more efficient movement of the mobile robot, a desired heading direction of the robot considering motion vectors of the robot and the human is proposed.",

        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "We present a new machine learning algorithm for learning optimal feedback control policies to guide a robot to a goal in the presence of obstacles. Our method works by first reducing the problem of obstacle avoidance to a continuous state, action, and time control problem, and then uses efficient collocation methods to solve for an optimal feedback control policy. This formulation of the obstacle avoidance problem improves over standard approaches, such as potential field methods, by being resistant to local minima, allowing for moving obstacles, handling stochastic systems, and computing feedback control strategies that take into account the robot's (possibly non-linear) dynamics. In addition to contributing a new method for obstacle avoidance, our work contributes to the state-of-the-art in collocation methods for non-linear stochastic optimal control problems in two important ways: (1) we show that taking into account local gradient and second-order derivative information of the optimal value function at the collocation points allows us to exploit knowledge of the derivative information about the system dynamics, and (2) we show that computational savings can be achieved by directly fitting the gradient of the optimal value function rather than the optimal value function itself. We validate our approach on three problems: non-convex obstacle avoidance of a point-mass robot, obstacle avoidance for a 2 degree of freedom robotic manipulator, and optimal control of a non-linear dynamical system.",

Various control approaches have been proposed in the literature but few of them have been experimentally validated. In this paper, we point out the problem of navigation controllability of magnetic microrobots in high viscous fluids and under pulsatile flow for endovascular applications. We consider the experimental navigation along a desired trajectory, in a simplified millimeter-sized arterial bifurcation, operating in fluids at the low-Reynolds-number regime where viscous drag significantly dominates over inertia. Different viscosity environments are tested under a systolic pulsatile flow compatible with heart beating. The control performances in terms tracking, robustness and stability are then experimentally demonstrated.",

Each pneumatic actuator has four on/off valves, thus sixteen possible combinations (\u201coperating modes\u201d) for the valves exist but only seven of them are both functional and unique. While previous works have focused on three-mode sliding-based position control of one pneumatic actuator, this paper develops seven-mode sliding-based bilateral control of a teleoperation system comprising a pair of pneumatic actuators. The proposed bilateral sliding control scheme is experimentally validated on a pair of actuators arranged in a force-position teleoperation architecture. The results demonstrate that leveraging the additional modes of operation leads to more efficient and smooth control of the system.",

However, at the scale of several micrometers, adhesion phenomenon highly perturbs the micro-objects release and the positioning. This phenomenon is directly linked to both the object and the gripper surface mechanical and chemical properties. The control of the adhesion properties requires multidisciplinary approaches including roughness control, mechanical properties control and chemical surface functionalisation.

        "abstract": "This paper investigates the role of precise estimation of contact points in force control. This analysis is motivated by scenarios in which robots make contacts, either voluntarily or accidentally, with different parts of their body. Control paradigms that are usually implemented in robots with no tactile system, make the hypothesis that contacts occur at the end-effectors only. In this paper we try to investigate what happens when this assumption is not verified. First we consider a simple feedforward force control law, and then we extend it by introducing a proportional feedback term. For both controllers we find the error in the resulting contact force, that is induced by a hypothetic error in the estimation of the contact point. We show that, depending on the geometry of the contact, incorrect estimation of contact points can induce undesired joint accelerations. We validate the presented analysis with tests on a simulated robot arm. Moreover we consider a complex real world scenario, where most of the assumptions that we make in our analytical derivation do not hold. Through tests on the iCub humanoid robot we see how errors in contact localization affect the performance of a parallel force/position controller. In order to estimate contact points and contact forces on the forearm of the iCub we do not use any model of the environment, but we exploit its 6-axis force/torque sensor and its sensorized skin.",

        "abstract": "Instability and poor performance are two wellknown problems encountered in bilateral teleoperation over a communication channel with variable time delays, where force feedback from the slave side is provided to the master side. When unknown disturbances or external forces act on the master and/or the slave manipulators, the teleoperation system will be even more prone to stability and performance degradation. By adopting a Lyapunov approach, we present a novel nonlinear disturbance observer based control scheme for teleoperation systems that are subject to variable time delays and disturbances. Lumping the effects of dynamic uncertainties, unknown forces/torques exerted by the human operator and the remote environment, and external disturbances into a single disturbance term enables us to use a disturbance observer and suppress these disturbances in order to alleviate their adverse effects on the teleoperation system stability and performance. The proposed disturbance observer based control laws guarantee asymptotic disturbance tracking, asymptotic position tracking, and stability of teleoperation system in both constrained and free motions. Experimental results are presented to verify the effectiveness of the proposed approach.",

Apart from time delay, the nonlinear non-minimum phase deflection of flexible-link slave manipulators creates extra challenges for control of telerobotic systems. These challenges have forced most of the prior research to use basic simplifications. In this paper, we try to remove most of the simplifications using a more realistic model for slave deflections. The degrading effects of flexibility on stability and performance of conventional telerobotics architectures are analyzed. Then, the standard Extended Lawrence Four-Channel (ELFC) control architecture is modified to obtain the stability condition and to enhance performance. Finally, the input-to-output stability (IOS) Small-Gain Theorem is used to generalize the stability criteria for varying delay and to remove the restrictive assumption of deflection-linearity. The proposed architecture consists of a local Partial Feedback Linearization scheme embedded into a modified ELFC architecture.

        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "In this paper, two control strategies to move a planar robot arm with a non-invasive spontaneous brain-machine interface (BMI) have been compared. The BMI is based on the correlation of EEG maps and allows differentiating between two mental tasks related to motor imagery. Using the BMI, the user is able to control 2D movements of the robot arm in order to reach several goals. The first control strategy is based on a hierarchical control and the second one uses a directional control of the movement. The robot arm used is the PuParm, a force-controlled planar robot designed and developed by the nBio research group at the Miguel Hern\u00e1ndez University of Elche (Spain). Three goals have been placed on the experimental setup. After performing the tests, time taken to reach the goals and errors have been presented and compared, showing the advantages and disadvantages of each strategy. The evidence from this study suggests that the control of a planar robot is possible with both strategies. The hierarchical control is slower but more reliable, while the directional control is much faster and more relaxing for the user, but less precise. These findings indicate that future assistive applications like grasping daily objects in a realistic environment could be performed with this system.",

        "abstract": "A class of path following and formation controllers are implemented on marine robots performing autonomous surveys in regions polluted by crude oil during the Deepwater Horizon oil spill. The controllers enable the robots to follow lines and curves, and maintain formation collectively while measuring reminiscent crude oil along their paths. The controllers are mathematically sound with proven convergence and robustness. However, their performance in the surveying missions is affected by natural disturbances caused by wind and water currents, and constraints such as sensor inaccuracy, localization errors, and network delays. This paper evaluates the performance of our controllers based on data collected during a survey performed at Grand Isle, Louisiana. These results will provide guidance for mission designs and inspire the future developments of our marine robots used to perform autonomous environmental surveys.",

        "abstract": "This paper presents a new control approach to achieve robust hopping with upright trunk in the sagittal plane. It relies on an innovative concept for trunk stabilization, called Virtual Pendulum concept, recently proposed, based on experimental finding in animal locomotion. With this concept, the trunk is stabilized by redirecting the ground reaction force to a virtual support point, named Virtual Pivot Point (VPP). This concept is combined with a new leg adjustment scheme to induce stable hopping when an extended trunk is added to SLIP model. The stability is investigated by Poincar\u00e9 map analysis. With fixed VPP position, stability, disturbance rejection and moderate robustness are achieved, but with low convergence speed. To improve the performances and attain higher robustness, event based control of VPP position is introduced, using feedback of the system state at apex. Dead beat control and Discrete LQR are alternatively considered to adjust the feedback gains. In both cases, considerable enhancements with respect to stability, convergence speed and robustness against perturbations are achieved.",

This tethered miniature robot (80g), which is autonomous in terms of its computational power requirements, is equipped with a 13.5-g quasi-panoramic visual system consisting of 4 individual visual motion sensors responding to the optic flow generated by photographs of natural scenes, thanks to the bio-inspired \u201ctime of travel\u201d scheme. Based on recent findings on insects' sensing abilities and control strategies, the BeeRotor robot was designed to use optic flow to perform complex tasks such as ground and ceiling following while also automatically driving its forward speed on the basis of the ventral or dorsal optic flow. In addition, the BeeRotor robot can perform tricky manoeuvers such as automatic ceiling docking by simply regulating its dorsal or ventral optic flow in high-roofed tunnel depicting natural scenes. Although it was built as a proof of concept, the BeeRotor robot is one step further towards achieving a fully-autonomous micro-helicopter which is capable of navigating mainly on the basis of the optic flow.",

The proposed method gives a simple and accurate calibration mean using a small 3D reference object. Extrinsic and intrinsic parameters are recovered simultaneously by capturing the object placed arbitrarily in different locations in the capture volume. The proposed method first solves the problem linearly with factorizing projection matrices into the camera and the object pose parameters. Due to the multi-view constraints imposed on the factorization, the consistency of rigid transformations among cameras and objects can be acquired. These consistent estimation results can be further refined by a non-linear optimization process. The proposed algorithm is evaluated via simulated and real experiments to verify that it is more efficient than previous methods.",

We focus on the visual recognition of hand gestures, but the solutions that we provide have general applicability and address a number of challenges common to many distributed sensing and classification problems. In our approach, robots acquire and process hand images from multiple points of view, most of which do not allow for a satisfactory classification. Each robot is equipped with a statistical classifier, which is used to generate an opinion for the sensed gesture. Using a low-bandwidth wireless channel, the robots locally exchange their opinions. They also exploit mobility to adapt their positions to maximize the mutual information collectively gathered by the swarm. A distributed consensus protocol is implemented, to allow to rapidly settle on a decision once enough evidence is available. The system is implemented and demonstrated on real robots. In addition, extensive quantitative results of emulation experiments, based on a real image dataset, are reported. We consider different scenarios and study the scalability and the robustness of the swarm performance for distributed recognition.",

We formulate a novel Model Predictive Control (MPC) based concept for formation driving in a leader-follower constellation into a required target region. The formation to target region problem in 3D is solved using the MPC methodology for both: i) the trajectory planning and control of a virtual leader, and ii) the control and stabilization of followers - UAVs and UGVs. The core of the method lies in a novel avoidance function based on a model of the formation respecting requirements of the direct visibility between the team members in environment with obstacles, which is crucial for the hawk-eye localization.",

The robot should have toughness and high mobility in a location of stairs and obstacles. In this study, we propose a brand new type of mobile base named \u201ccrank-wheel\u201d suitable for such use. Crank-wheel consists of wheels and connecting coupler link named crank-leg. Crank-wheel makes simple and smooth wheeled motion on flat ground and automatically transforms to the walking motion on rugged terrain as the crank-legs starts to contact the surface of the rugged terrain and acts as legs. This mechanism features its simple, easiness to maintain water and dust proof structure, and limited danger of biting rubbles in the driving mechanism just as the case of tracked vehicles. Effectiveness of the Crank-wheel is confirmed by several driving experiments on debris, sand and bog.",

In this work we show for the first time how probabilistic costmaps can be learned in a self-supervised manner by a robot navigating in an outdoor environment. Traversability estimates garnered from onboard sensing are used in conjunction with colour information from a-priori available overhead imagery to extrapolate the traversability of locations previously traversed by the robot to a much larger area. Gaussian processes are used to predict the traversability at unknown locations in the 2D map, and a number of techniques to deal with heteroscedastic noise and varying confidence in the training data are evaluated. A prior technique to exploit the probabilistic nature of the map in a probabilistic heuristic for A* search demonstrates that planning over these maps can also be done efficiently.",

        "abstract": "Existing approaches to visual Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) typically utilize points as visual feature primitives to represent landmarks in the environment. Since these techniques mostly use image points from a standard feature point detector, they do not explicitly map objects or regions of interest. Our work is motivated by the need for different SLAM techniques in path and riverine settings, where feature points can be scarce or may not adequately represent the environment. Accordingly, the proposed approach uses cubic B\u00e9zier curves as stereo vision primitives and offers a novel SLAM formulation to update the curve parameters and vehicle pose. This method eliminates the need for point-based stereo matching, with an optimization procedure to directly extract the curve information in the world frame from noisy edge measurements. Further, the proposed algorithm enables navigation with fewer feature states than most point-based techniques, and is able to produce a map which only provides detail in key areas. Results in simulation and with vision data validate that the proposed method can be effective in estimating the 6DOF pose of the stereo camera, and can produce structured, uncluttered maps.",

We propose a method for generating directions that maximizes the probability of a human arriving at the correct destination, taking into account a model of their ability to follow topological, metrical, and landmark-based directions. We discuss optimization techniques for employing these models and present a method, DART, for extracting model-improved sets of directions in a tractable amount of time. DART employs particle simulation techniques to maximize the probability that the modeled wayfinder will successfully reach their destination. Our synthetic evaluation shows that DART produces improvements in arrival rates over existing methods and illustrates how DART's directions reflect properties of the wayfinder model.",

If the size of the wheel is fixed, the robot can only pass through a hole bigger than the wheel size. Furthermore, the robot cannot climb stairs much higher than the wheel size. Therefore, for a wheeled robot that has fixed dimensions, it is hard to improve the mobility depending on unexpected situations such as passing through a hole smaller than the original robot size and climbing stairs much higher than the original wheel size. To deal with the scale problem, we propose a deformable wheeled robot that can change the shape of the wheel depending on the obstacles. It improves the mobility the wheeled robot. In order to make the simple and robust robot, we employ smart structures and actuators such as composite flexure linkages, deformable polymers and shape memory alloy actuators. The robot shows three kinds of motion with combination of the motor and the SMA coil actuator. The motor is used for driving the wheel and the SMA coil actuators deform the wheel to produce a caterpillar-like motion. Using both actuators, the legged wheel motion can be produced. The light weight and the multimodal locomotion of the robot enhance the mobility for the search and rescue robot application.",

        "abstract": "Accurate recovery of the 3D structure of a deforming surgical environment during minimally invasive surgery is important for intra-operative guidance. One key component of reliable reconstruction is accurate camera pose estimation, which is challenging for monocular cameras due to the paucity of reliable salient features, coupled with narrow baseline during surgical navigation. With recent advances in miniaturized MEMS sensors, the combination of inertial and vision sensing can provide increased robustness for camera pose estimation particularly for scenes involving tissue deformation. The aim of this work is to propose a robust framework for intra-operative free-form deformation recovery based on structure-from-motion. A novel adaptive Unscented Kalman Filter (UKF) parameterization scheme is proposed to fuse vision information with data from an Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU). The method is built on a compact scene representation scheme suitable for both surgical episode identification and instrument-tissue motion modelling. Detailed validation with both synthetic and phantom data is performed and results derived justify the potential clinical value of the technique.",

        "abstract": "The body representation in the human mind is dynamic, and illusions or traumatic events can modify it to include additional limbs. This remarkable adaptability of the central nervous system to different body configurations opens new possibilities in the field of human augmentation. In order to fully exploit this potential, we developed a new type of wearable co-robot that can perform tasks in close coordination with the human user. The system, named Supernumerary Robotic Limbs (SRL), consists of two additional robotic arms worn through a backpack-like harness. The SRL can assist the user by holding objects, lifting weights and streamlining the execution of a task. If the SRL perform movements closely coordinated with the user and exhibit human-like dynamics, they might be incorporated into the body representation and perceived as parts of the user's body. As a result, the human would be able to extend the range of available skills and manipulation possibilities, performing tasks more effectively and with less effort. This paper presents a communication, estimation and control method for the SRL, aimed to perform tasks in tight coordination with the wearer. The SRL observes the user motion, and actively assists the human by employing a coordinated control algorithm. In particular, skills involving the direct cooperation of two human workers are transferred to the SRL and a single user. Demonstration data of the two humans - a leader and an assistant - are analyzed and a state estimation algorithm is extracted from them. This can be used to control the SRL accordingly with the used end effectors. A causal relationship relating the assistant's motion to the leader's motion is identified based on System Identification methods. This approach is applied to a drilling operation performed by two workers. An effective coordination skill is identified and transferred to the SRL, to make them act like the human follower.",

        "abstract": "Disparity computation in occluded or texture-less regions is considered to be a fundamental issue in dense stereo matching, but there is another practical issue that must be resolved before it can be used effectively in various robotics applications. This issue is the problem of intensity difference between corresponding pixels of an image pair. To tackle such problems, we present a dependable stereo matching algorithm using two-layer recurrent process and chaining search. Two-layer process integrates pixel and region-levels information through recurrent interaction. To estimate the precise disparities in occluded regions, reliable disparities in non-occluded region are propagated to occluded regions by the proposed chaining search. To test our algorithm, it was compared with two outstanding algorithms in Middlebury benchmark using Gaussian noisy images. The results validated the effectiveness of our approach.",

The mammals' excellent performance, especially the cheetah, provides us much inspiration on control, mechanical design and etc. In this paper, a model of the cheetah robot is developed for researching the locomotory behaviors of fast running. Under the biological knowledge on neural mechanism, a new bio-inspired control method was proposed via controlling the muscles flexion and extension movements. Then, a bio-musculoskeletal hindlimb prototype was designed in this paper. The muscle-like actuator and the cheetah-like structure combining the bio-control approach provide more natural fashion for the new robot. Finally, the simulation of the bounding gait establishes good biological properties, cheetah-like leg's trajectory. Experiment with the real hindlimb prototype validates the design and the development of the structure and the controller. In the near future, a final prototype will be manufactured with onboard power and air source.",

The basic structure of 2-DOF decoupled kinematic actuator module has two motion units. Since one motion unit can be moved in only one direction, various applications are available and it can solve the parasitic motion fundamentally. The two motion units also have fine motion and coarse motion respectively. Besides it can be variously modified based on how the actuators are connected. Then the hardware of 2-DOF decoupled kinematic actuator module is implemented with one actuator and two additional locking devices.

Once the device is inserted to the desired surgical site, it can be reconfigured by lifting an articulated section, and protruding two tendon driven flexible arms. Each of the arms holds an interchangeable surgical instrument. The articulated section features a 2 Degrees-of-Freedom (DoF) universal joint followed by a single DoF yaw joint. It incorporates an on-board camera and LED light source at the distal end, leaving a \u00d83mm channel for an additional instrument. The main shaft of the robot is largely hollow, leaving ample space for the insertion of two tendon driven flexible arms integrated with surgical instruments. The ex-vivo and in-vivo experiments demonstrate the potential clinical value of the device for performing surgical tasks through single incision or natural orifice transluminal procedures.",

        "abstract": "Simultaneously considering the physical interaction between the user and the robot within safety and performance constraints in rehabilitation and human walking situations, this paper proposes a new backdrivable torsion spring actuator (BTSA) with hybrid control that switches between direct electromyography (EMG) biofeedback control and zero impedance control, to provide a novel rehabilitation training and walking assistance mechanism for humans. The proposed backdrivable 1-DOF serial elastic actuator is designed to achieve intrinsic safety, compliance properties, and control performance. The proposed mechanical system can provide desirable backdrivable property and softer stiffness than that of traditional robots. In additional, the proposed hybrid control not only considers the assistive function, when human assistance is required, but also the compliance property, when assistance is not needed. Compared to state-of-the-art assistive methods, the BTSA with the proposed hybrid control system is unique in that it can simultaneously achieve assistance control through EMG biofeedback and compliance control through zero impedance control. A simple human-robot interaction model is built to investigate performance and explain the whole control concept. Further, a knee exoskeleton is built and three kinds of controls are used on a human subject to demonstrate the difference between them. Both simulation and experimental results show that the proposed BTSA mechanism with hybrid control offers the desired properties.",

The layer jamming mechanism is composed of multiple layers of thin Mylar film, and makes use of amplified friction between the films by applying vacuum pressure. In contrast to other tunable stiffness technology, such as particle jamming or field-activated materials (MR or ER fluids), layer jamming occupies a small volume and thus can be applied to small, light weight manipulators. The snake-like manipulator presented here is composed only of Mylar film and wires, and has highly flexible and under-actuated properties without application of a vacuum; however, it becomes highly stiff when a vacuum is applied. In this paper the characteristics of layer jamming are explored: its stiffness and breaking strength are obtained both theoretically and experimentally, and a prototype manipulator is developed and experimentally characterized.",

        "abstract": "Robotic manipulators for minimally invasive surgeries have traditionally been rigid, with a steerable end effector. While the rigidity of manipulators improve precision and controllability, it limits reachability and dexterity in constrained environments. Soft manipulators with controllable stiffness on the other hand, can be deployed in single port or natural orifice surgical applications to reach a wide range of areas inside the body, while being able to passively adapt to uncertain external forces, adapt the stiffness distribution to suit the kinematic and dynamic requirements of the task, and provide flexibility for configuration control. Here, we present the design of a snake-like laboratory made soft robot manipulator of 20 mm in average diameter, which can actuate, soften, or stiffen joints independently along the length of the manipulator by combining granular jamming with McKibben actuators. It presents a comprehensive study on the relative contributions of the granule size, material type, and membrane coupling on the range, profile, and variability of stiffness.",

More specifically we show that operator awareness should be implemented as an integrated part of the safety level to maintain safety during surgery.",

        "abstract": "Complex controlled motions, soft human interaction, and minimal moving mass all drive the need for soft robots using fluid filled fiber reinforced elastomer enclosures (FREEs). While a narrow class of FREEs known as McKibben's actuators have been extensively studied, there is a wide unexplored class with complex sets of motion patterns. Combining these actuators in parallel can yield versatile motion patterns resulting in a large overall workspace. Mobility of individual actuators is enforced by inextensibility of fibers and incompressibility of fluids, which in turn drives the net attainable motions. In this paper, we map the mobility of individual FREE actuators to all possible resultant motions that a combination of three sets of actuators arranged in a triangular configuration would undergo. This understanding has resulted in a preliminary design tool that determines individual FREE topologies for a required set of motion patterns. Five case studies that result from this methodology are prototyped and tested for comparison of the predicted and obtained motion directions.",

These enable a systematic analysis of the design space and characteristic curves as well as to derive guidelines for the design of improved prototypes. The derived models are applied to investigate the effects of the active and passive, mono- and biarticular structures on different performance criteria of 1D hopping motions by means of a detailed multi-body system dynamics simulation.",

        "abstract": "Early intervention in mental disorders can dramatically increase an individual's quality of life. Additionally, when symptoms of mental illness appear in childhood or adolescence, they represent the later stages of a process that began years earlier. One goal of psychiatric research is to identify risk-markers: genetic, neural, behavioral and/or social deviations that indicate elevated risk of a particular mental disorder. Ideally, screening of risk-markers should occur in a community setting, and not a clinical setting which may be time-consuming and resource-intensive. Given this situation, a system for automatically detecting risk-markers in children would be highly valuable. In this paper, we describe such a system that has been installed at the Shirley G. Moore Lab School, a research pre-school at the University of Minnesota. This system consists of multiple RGB+D sensors and is able to detect children and adults in the classroom, tracking them as they move around the room. We use the tracking results to extract high-level information about the behavior and social interaction of children, that can then be used to screen for early signs of mental disorders.",

        "abstract": "This paper proposes a linear power assist unit to be simply designed by using an add-on end-effector and gives a controller design for the unit explicitly taking into consideration mechanical impedances of both a human operator and environment. The proposed end-effector transmits assisting force to the environment via a pair of assisting springs, and the displacement of the assisting springs is controlled to generate a desirable power assisting according to the force applied by the operator. In the proposed system, the assist gain, i.e., the ratio of the sum of the human-applied force and the assisting force to the human-applied force, can be online changed so as to easily adjust a stress loading, and it could be helpful in rehabilitations to tune the load depending on the degree of recovery. A prototype of the proposed power assist unit has been developed and was evaluated from viewpoints of both the time and frequency domains. Experimental results showed that the prototype has robustly worked well against perturbations of the environment, keeping the power assist control bandwidth about 1 to 3 Hz, and the validity of the variable assist gain control has also confirmed.",

Most robot hands have small size simultaneously many joints as compared with robot manipulators. Components of actuator, gear, and sensors used for building robots are not small and are expensive, and those make it difficult to build a small sized robot hand. Differently from conventional development of robot hands, KITECH hand adopts a RC servo module that is cheap, easily obtainable, and easy to handle. The RC servo module that have been already used for several small sized humanoid can be new solution of building small sized robot hand with many joints. The feasibility of KITECH hand in object manipulation is shown through various experimental results. It is verified that the modified RC servo module is one of effective solutions in the development of a robot hand.",

        "abstract": "This paper describes the development of an endoscopic robot attached to a large intestine endoscope. Colorectal cancer can be cured completely if they are discovered and treated early with a large intestine endoscope. Conventional endoscope can screen and heal inside of the intestine. But, operation of the endoscope is hard for doctors; the training is needed many times. In addition, even if experienced doctors, it occasionally spends one hour for this operation. In this study, in order to solve these problems, we propose the endoscopic robot using peristaltic crawling with bellows-type artificial rubber muscle. This robot can move forward automatically and pulling up the slack. In addition, because of bellows-type artificial rubber muscle, this robot can also pass bent pipes like splenic flexure. Unlike another endoscopic robot, our robot can be attached the endoscope. Thus we can use various function of the conventional endoscope. In this paper, in order to pass splenic flexure, we describe that we fabricated bellows-type artificial muscle. Next, we experimentally confirmed that the robot can pull up the sigmoid colon of the large intestine of dead swine that is arranged in the human body. In addition, in a large intestine model, we reach a endoscope to the cecum with the robot.",

The relative localization method proposed in this paper has the ability to localize a dynamic agent with respect to only one leader ground robot in a GPS denied environment. The sensor solution proposed in the study employs a combination of an acoustic sensor and an infra-red(IR) based vision sensor for relative range and bearing estimations respectively. An extended Kalman filter performs the sensor fusion using a four degree of freedom kinematic model. Numerical simulations validate the sensor fusion scheme for both ground and aerial robotic relative localization. An experimental test-bed of the system with the hardware implementation of the sensors were developed. For comparison purposes the self localization modules of the robots are further integrated into the experimental setup. Realtime experiments were performed where 5\u201310 cm mean accuracy of pose estimation was achieved in multiple experiments.",

Although most commercial surface EMG amplifier systems provide high performance in acquiring electric bio-signals, they are not convenient for myoelectric control applications because they usually use wet-type electrodes that should be attached to the skin individually and there are also some limitations to possible modifications. In this study, we propose and develop a surface EMG interface that employs dry-type electrodes, a single supplied circuit for reduced weight, two voltage followers to improve input impedance, and a modified driven-right-leg circuit using a virtual ground circuit. By adapting a wearable band-type interface. The EMG electrodes can be reused while offering high performance corresponding to that of commercial products. The developed surface EMG system was successfully applied to decode human motion intentions of eight different configurations and a rest condition by using a fast training algorithms in a non-targeted manner.",

        "abstract": "Neurologic examination takes an important role in diagnosis of the nerve system diseases. Neurologic medical staffs, especially the novices, need to be trained on this skill. There are many methodologies which can help to accumulate experiences, such as watching video, reading books, making use of the simulated patient (SP), and so on. However, the best way is to practice on the real patient. All the above methods have their own drawbacks such as lack of active interactions, limitation of multi-symptoms' reproducing, etc. To improve the training effectiveness, an arm robot is proposed in this paper for neurologic examination training as one part of the whole body patient robot named Waseda Kyotokagaku Patient (WKP). In this robot, various symptoms of the elbow force, biceps tendon reflex, involuntary action, and so on, are simulated and shown to the trainee. Finally, a set of experiments was carried out to verify our proposed mechanism and control system. Three neurologists with over 30 years' experience were invited to show their opinions on the reproductions of patients' symptoms, and to discuss the results. The effectiveness of this system was confirmed. The experimental results lead to the consideration that the approach is worth following in further research.",

        "abstract": "Pipe failures resulting from corrosion or other forms of deterioration are a common occurrence. To combat this problem, in-pipe inspections are required Fiberscopes are currently used as industrial endoscopes to inspect pipes for defects. However, because of friction, fiberscopes cannot be inserted into pipes that are more than 15 m long or have complex shapes such as elbows. Therefore, in-pipe inspection robots need to be self-propelling. In this study, we developed two robots that mimic the peristaltic crawling motion of earthworms as a locomotion mechanism. These robots consist of several units. Each unit has an artificial muscle that is driven by pneumatics. Each of the robots has an internal space to hold inspection apparatus. We conducted several experiments with a robot inside a 25A acrylic pipe (diameter: 27 mm). These experiments were conducted to examine the relationship between the locomotion speed and motion patterns. The robot was able to pass through the elbows that were positioned in both horizontal and vertical planes. In addition, we developed a smaller robot for a 15A pipe (diameter: 16 mm) to examine the relationship between the locomotion speed and motion patterns. Our findings exhibited good performance by the robots.",

Facial expressions of our old robotic head have low facial expression recognition rate and in order to improve it we asked amateur cartoonists to create computer graphics (CG) images. To realize such expressions found in the CGs, the new head was provided with 24-DoFs and facial color. We designed compact mechanisms that fit into the head, which dimensions are based on average adult Japanese female size. We conducted a survey with pictures and videos to evaluate the expression ability. Results showed that facial expression recognition rates for the 6 basic emotions are increased compared to the old KOBIAN's head.",

        "abstract": "A practical robot for search and rescue operation is demanded. We believe that one of the most promising robot is a snake-like robot with a slim and active trunk. This paper proposes a new multi-wheeled snake-like robot with active elastic trunk. We choose active wheels for the propulsive device due to mechanical robustness and simplicity, and increase locomotion capability by serially arranging many active wheels along to the trunk. We also propose a new mechanism for the trunk which satisfies both active bending motion and passive compliance. The active elastic trunk consists of deformable elastic segments made of sponge and rigid (or semi-rigid) segments, where active wheel is attached, stacked in layers. The active bending motion is generated by pulling the cables passing through the trunk from the head to tail. We develop three prototypes named \u201cSouryu-VII\u201d, \u201cSouryu-VIII\u201d and \u201cSouryu-IX\u201d. The mechanical design and features for each prototypes are explained and their performances are evaluated through the experiments with various measures.",

In this study, the power assist wear for lower limb is developed. The developed wear is like trousers. A human can be assisted by just wearing trousers on which the pneumatic soft actuators are put. The pneumatic soft actuator has a high power weight ratio, and has a light weight. These features contribute to realize the simple structure which is like clothes.

        "abstract": "This paper describes a novel human-sized robot hand that has the ability to adjust its joint stiffness and sense external forces. This robot hand consists of four fingers, each with three joints. To downsize the finger modules, the DIP and PIP joints are coupled with a linkage mechanism and actuated by a single motor. In addition, for the MP joint, two kinds of silicone rubber cushion, SRCtrans and SRCstiff , are inserted between the motor and the output link. The elasticity of the SRCtrans provides softness to the joint. On the other hand, the SRCstiff compresses the SRCtrans by its expansion and as a result controls the stiffness of the joint. Furthermore, the MP joint can estimate the direction and magnitude of the forces exerted from multiple directions by measuring the pressure inside the SRCtrans. In this paper, we present the detailed mechanism of the robot fingers and examine their basic performance for an adjustable range of joint stiffness, controllability, output, and sensing of external forces. We then demonstrate the effectiveness of this hand for human-care by applying it to a human massage.",

This lower-limb robot is designed as an experimental system for studying biped locomotion based on force and torque controlled joints. The robot has 13 actuated DOF and torque sensors are integrated at all the joints except the waist joint. We designed a new tendon type joint modules as a pitch joint drive module, which is highly back-drivable and elastic. We also built a decentralized control system using the small controller boards named Smart Driver.

With respect to position-based approaches, our method does not require the estimation of the 3D pose (direct), nor the extraction and matching of 3D features (dense) and only requires dense depth maps provided by 3D sensors. Our approach has been validated in servoing experiments using the depth information from a low cost RGB-D sensor. Positioning tasks are properly achieved despite the noisy measurements, even when partial occlusions or scene modifications occur.",

In this paper we propose a risk-sensitive optimal feedback controller for physical assistance that autonomously adapts the robot's behavior even during unknown situations. Using a probabilistic model to represent the cooperative task execution behavior and modeling the human as a source of process noise in the system, the proposed assistive controller proactively contributes to the task anticipating the human motion. Estimating online the current level of disagreement and prediction uncertainty, the assistive controller consequently calculates the optimal task contribution providing higher adaptability. A psychological evaluation compares different assistive control strategies in a virtual scenario using a two-Degree-of-Freedom haptic experimental setup. Results show that considering the current level of disagreement enhances the performance of the controller in terms of helpfulness and human effort minimization.",

In the paper a generalized scheme of urban obstacle negotiation process using the Finite State Machine model was presented. In each state the robot performs the movement or gathers the data from sensors. The transitions are made according to events which are external signals depending on the particular set of robot variables. The obtained automaton is generic with respect to the type of the obstacle. The same automaton describes negotiation of curbs, platforms and stairs (in ascent and descent phase). In this article at first the extended automaton is presented. Then the reduced form of the Finite State Machine is described. Next the experiments on simulator and on the real robot are demonstrated. The experimental set-up consists of a robot and an environment with a curb and stairs. The robot was able to negotiate these obstacles using the same automaton.",

        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "We consider the problem of distributed partitioning of an environment by a set of robots so that each robot performs its operations in the region within the corresponding cell. Voronoi partitioning is one of the most attractive techniques that has been used to solve this problem. It has been used in several distributed multi-robotic system and sensor network applications, such as sensor coverage, search and rescue, and coverage path planning. For a truly distributed implementation of such problems, each robot should be able to compute the corresponding Voronoi cell in a distributed manner. Further, in a practical application, the robots' sensors may have limited range, thus each robot may operate within a portion of its Voronoi cell constrained by the sensor range. We describe a distributed algorithm for computation of this range constrained Voronoi cell where each robot independently constructs chords corresponding to other robots that are within a distance of twice its sensor circle radius. A robot then uses a simple and fast technique to remove inessential chords to calculate the vertices of its Voronoi cell. We prove completeness and correctness of the proposed algorithm, and also provide the upper and lower bounds on the computational complexity of our algorithm. The theoretical results are validated with the help of experiments to show that for different values of sensor ranges, our proposed algorithm incurs a time complexity that is significantly lower than that of the existing full Voronoi partition computation algorithm. The maximum number of steps required by our algorithm is also shown to be within a constant times the lower bound given by the number of neighbors of each node.",

In the case where all sensors are centrally measurable, a linear-optimal estimate is obtained. This method is used as a way for estimating altitude and attitude of the Distributed Flight Array, a modular multi-propeller flying vehicle where each module in the array obtains its own distance measurement and coordinates with its immediate neighbour(s) actions for flight. To account for communication bandwidth constraints, a scalable, distributed scheme is presented where each module shares local information. In the limit of sharing information, each module asymptotically computes the linear-optimal altitude and attitude estimate.",

        "abstract": "We consider a flotilla composed of N autonomous mobile agents. Each agent ignores its absolute position but collects noisy measurements of the relative position of other agents. It has a convex utility function which depends on its control variables and on some global variables, typically, the average motion of all agents during a unit of time. The utility function of an agent is unknown by other agents. The aim is to determine the control variables which minimize the sum of all utility functions. The minimization is subject to constraints: speed limitations, collision avoidance and maintenance of the flock. We provide sufficient convex and separable conditions which guarantee that constraints are satisfied. These conditions allow to search for a minimizer of the aggregate utility function in a distributed fashion. The proposed algorithm simultaneously involves a gradient descent locally performed by the agents and a random gossip step which allows to find an agreement on the global motion strategy. In the case when there is a large number of transmissions during each unit of time, the algorithm is proved to converge almost surely to the desired minimizer, under mild conditions on the gossip protocol. When transmissions become less frequent, the minimization problem is no longer likely to be solved exactly. However, we propose an adaptive algorithm capable of tracking the minimizer. Its behavior is characterized through detailed simulations.",

Starting from the work of Bullo et al. [8] who formalized the problem of cooperative sensor coverage as a multicenter optimization problem, we show that also this problem can be formulated and solved using related concepts. However, we evidence that the resulting function to be optimized loses some desirable properties and requires a more sophisticated controller. After having identified the peculiar aspects of this new function to be optimized and having studied its critical points, we provide a controller and show that it will drive the system to a stable local optimizer. The control strategy is distributed in the sense of Voronoi, and it implements a distributed version of the gradient projection method known in the optimization literature. Numerical simulations illustrate how the controller works, and we conclude sketching some theoretical properties.",

        "abstract": "In this paper the subtasks of lifting, pushing, and pulling of an Inverted PENdulum Type Assistant Robot (IPENTAR) are described. These three motions comprise the initial work for the larger task of transporting of a load. During execution of these tasks, the forces that are applied on the robot are seen as disturbances and cause errors in the system. If these errors are not compensated the system may become unable to perform the task. One way of compensating for these errors is to implement an observer that can estimate the applied disturbance and then use the estimated value as feedback. Most observers rely heavily on the system model parameters which can have inaccuracies or are difficult to obtain. And so an observer that requires little system information known as the Extended State Observer is applied to the system. Disturbance tests and the control for the pushing, pulling, and lifting are discussed and results are presented.",

        "abstract": "Drivers of vehicles with one or several passive trailers, like truck-and-trailer or articulated luggage carriers, have difficulties in backward maneuvers due to jackknife and lack of visibility. Advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS) can be helpful to improve both safety and driver comfort in these complex operations. In this paper, we propose an ADAS that adopts our curvature limitation method for backward multi-trailer vehicles, where the last trailer is considered a virtual tractor and steering limits are established to avoid jackknife and inter-unit collisions. In the proposed solution, when the driver puts the vehicle in reverse, the steering wheel and pedals can be used as if the vehicle was driven from the back of the last trailer with visual feedback from a camera. This system can be implemented in drive-by-wire vehicles, where the steering-wheel feedback force can be customized for the curvature limitation of a given combination of one or several trailers. The system has been tested to tele-operate a mobile robot with two off-axle trailers.",

        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "In this paper, an ATV (All-Terrain Vehicle) rollover prevention system is proposed. Dynamic instability evaluation is based on the on-line estimation and prediction of the Lateral Load Transfer (LLT) from a vehicle model based on two 2D representations. As off-road vehicles are considered, grip conditions have a large influence. They are here estimated relying on observation theory. Nevertheless, two main behaviours (over/under-steering) may be encountered pending on grip and vehicle configuration. Since only a low cost perception system can be considered in ATV applications, these two opposite dynamics cannot be explicitly discriminated. As a result, two observers are designed, according to the vehicle behaviour, to estimate on-line the terrain properties (grip conditions, global sideslip angle and bank angle) and a \u201csupervisor\u201d selects on-line the right observer. Next, a predictive control algorithm, based on the extrapolation of rider's action and the selected estimated dynamical state, allows the rollover risk to be anticipated, enabling to warn the pilot and to consider the implementation of active actions. Simulations and full-scale experimentations are presented to discuss the efficiency of the proposed solution.",

A gecko-inspired adhesive is mounted with an elastomer tendon and polymer loop to a remote-center-of-motion ankle that allows rapid engagement with the surface and minimizes peeling moments on the adhesive. The maximum velocity possible while climbing decreases as the incline gets closer to vertical, with the robot able to achieve speeds of 10 cm second\u22121 at a 70-degree incline. A model is implemented to describe the effect of incline angle on climbing speed and, together with high-speed video evidence, reveals that climbing velocity is limited by robot dynamics and adhesive properties and not by power.",

We developed a new conceptual Narrow Tilting Vehicle (NTV) that has one front wheel and two rear wheels. The proposed NTV is very narrow and all three wheels can tilt to improve the stability during turning. We also derive a new switching dynamical model of the NTV. This model considers several states including normal running, temporary running with one rear wheel not on the ground and totally falling down. Based on this model, a simulation platform is established, which is useful to test different control methods and to investigate dangerous driving situations in case hurt drivers in real experiments. The effectiveness of proposed dynamical model is verified through comparison study of simulations and corresponding experiments.",

        "abstract": "This paper proposes the analysis of two strategies for motion imitation of articulated systems with balance constraint. The two systems have different dynamic characteristics and their respective motions are restricted to the sagittal plane. The first strategy is based on nonlinear time scaling of joint trajectories ensuring that the balance of the imitating system is maintained through the motion. With this approach, the imitating system tracks the input reference trajectory without modifying the task to be accomplished by compromising on acceleration of the motion to ensure the condition for the balance is satisfied. As a consequence of reducing acceleration, there exists a delay between the reference system and the imitating system. However, we have ascertained that the joint angles are accelerated for the delay created to catch up with the reference motion. In contrary, the second strategy modifies directly the joint angle trajectories to ensure balance. This approach is the traditional approach in motion imitation used in human to humanoid motion transposition. We have formulated both strategies as an optimization problem in order to obtain feasible joint trajectories for the imitator. This work is a preliminary study for the imitation of a human being by a humanoid robot.",

A rapid path planner based on RRT (Rapidly-exploring random trees) algorithm is applied to find a collision-free path for automatic cell transportation. The optical tweezers are employed to trap and move the cell along the generated path toward a pre-specified goal position. Extending our early reported work on static path planning, a new dynamic path planner that considers the environmental change due to the Brownian movement of the cells is developed. This dynamic path planner can successfully enable the trapped cell to avoid collisions with other cells during transportation in a dynamic environment. Experiments on transporting yeast cells are performed to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.",

        "abstract": "Maintaining a map of an environment that changes over time is a critical challenge in the development of persistently autonomous mobile robots. Many previous approaches to mapping assume a static world. In this work we incorporate the time dimension into the mapping process to enable a robot to maintain an accurate map while operating in dynamical environments. This paper presents Dynamic Pose Graph SLAM (DPG-SLAM), an algorithm designed to enable a robot to remain localized in an environment that changes substantially over time. Using incremental smoothing and mapping (iSAM) as the underlying SLAM state estimation engine, the Dynamic Pose Graph evolves over time as the robot explores new places and revisits previously mapped areas. The approach has been implemented for planar indoor environments, using laser scan matching to derive constraints for SLAM state estimation. Laser scans for the same portion of the environment at different times are compared to perform change detection; when sufficient change has occurred in a location, the dynamic pose graph is edited to remove old poses and scans that no longer match the current state of the world. Experimental results are shown for two real-world dynamic indoor laser data sets, demonstrating the ability to maintain an up-to-date map despite long-term environmental changes.",

        "abstract": "Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (AUVs) are used for an ever increasing range of applications due to the maturing of the technology. Due to the absence of the GPS signal underwater, the correct estimation of its position is a challenge for submerged vehicles. One promising strategy to mitigate this problem is to use a group of AUVs where one or more assume the role of a beacon vehicle which has a very accurate position estimate due to an expensive navigation suite or frequent surfacings. These beacon vehicles broadcast their position and the remaining survey vehicles can use this position information and intra-vehicle ranges to update their position estimate. The effectiveness of this approach strongly depends on the geometry between the beacon vehicles and the survey vehicles. The trajectories of the beacon vehicles should thus be planned with the goal to minimize the position uncertainty of the survey vehicles. We propose a distributed algorithm which dynamically computes the locally optimal position for a beacon vehicle using only information obtained from broadcast communication of the survey vehicles. It does not need prior information about the survey vehicles' trajectory and can be used for any group size of beacon and survey vehicles.",

Our method generates and evaluates a set of qualitatively distinct hypotheses of the local environment and refines the parameters within each hypothesis quantitatively. Our method is a continual, incremental process that transforms current environmental-structure hypotheses into children hypotheses describing the same environment in more detail. Since our method only relies on simple geometric and probabilistic inferences, our method runs in real-time, and it avoids the need of extensive prior training and the Manhattan-world assumption, which makes it practical and efficient for a navigating robot. Experimental results on a collection of indoor videos suggests that our method is capable of modeling various structures of indoor environments.",

While multiple robots can achieve the exploration task more quickly, this benefit comes with the cost of added complexity. Probabilistic occupancy grid maps from multiple agents must be merged in real-time without any prior knowledge of their relative transformation. In addition, the probabilistic information of the maps must be accounted for and fused accordingly. In this paper, a probabilistic version of the Generalized Voronoi Diagram (GVD), called the PGVD, is used to determine the relative transformation between maps and fuse them. The new method is effective for finding relative transformations quickly and reliably. In addition, the novel approach accounts for all map uncertainties in the fusion process.",

        "abstract": "This paper presents a reaching motion planning and execution framework tailored for exploration missions by human-operated humanoid robots in hazardous environments such as nuclear plants. This framework offers low-level but practical autonomy that allows the robot to plan and execute simple tasks, such as reaching a target object, within a reasonable amount of time. The human operator benefits from the efficiency of the framework to maneuver the robot without waiting for the planning results for minutes. The efficiency improvement is achieved in the following two phases. In the first phase, a reaching motion is planned quickly through approximation of mass distribution and kinematic structure to apply analytical solutions of inverse kinematics. Supposing that the robot is working in environments not completely known, the proposed planner can use measured voxel maps. In the second phase, the planned path is executed while compensating the approximation error in real time without violating other constraints. We confirm through simulations that a reaching motion for the HRP-2 humanoid with 30 DOFs in a constrained environment with pipes is planned in around one second. The simulation results also validate the efficiency of execution with real-time error compensation.",

        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "Coverage path planning is the problem of moving an effector (e.g. a robot, a sensor) over all points in a given region. In marine robotics, a number of applications require to cover a region on the seafloor while navigating above it at a constant depth. This is the case of Autonomous Surface Vehicles, that always navigate at the water surface level, but also of several Autonomous Underwater Vehicle tasks as well. Most existing coverage algorithms sweep the free space in the target region using lawnmower-like back-and-forth motions, and the inter-lap spacing between these back-and-forth laps is determined by the robot's sensor coverage range. However, while covering the seafloor surface by navigating above it at a constant depth, the sensor's field of view varies depending on the seafloor height. Therefore, to ensure full coverage one would need to use the inter-lap spacing determined by the shallowest point on the target surface, resulting in undesired coverage overlapping among the back-and-forth laps. In this work, we propose a novel method to generate a coverage path that completely covers a surface of interest on the seafloor by navigating in a constant-depth plane above it. The proposed method uses environment information to minimize the coverage overlapping by segmenting the target surface in regions of similar depth features and addressing them as individual coverage path planning problems. A cell decomposition coverage method is applied to each region. The surface gradient is used to determine the best sweep orientation in each cell, and the inter-lap spacing in the lawnmower-like paths used to cover each cell is maximized on a lap-by-lap basis, hence obtaining a shorter, more efficient coverage path. The proposal is validated in simulation experiments conducted with a real-world bathymetric dataset that show a significant increase on path efficiency in comparison with a standard boustrophedon coverage path.",

        "track": "main",
        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "For robots to operate in human environments, they are required to react safely to unexpected changes in the work area. However, existing manipulation task planning methods take more than several seconds or minutes to update their solutions when environmental changes are recognized. Furthermore, the computation time exponentially increases in case of highly complex structures such as humanoid robots. Therefore, we propose a reactive system for high d.o.f. robots to perform interactive manipulation tasks under real-time conditions. The paper describes the implementation of the Elastic Strip Framework, a plan modification approach to update initial motion plans. To improve its real-time performance and reliability, the previous geometric approximation is replaced by an implicit method that constructs an elastic tunnel for collision checking. Additionally, in order to maintain a robust system even in exceptional situations, such as undetected obstacles, the force transformer module executes compliant motions, and the current elastic strip adapts the path tracking motion by monitoring tracking errors of the actual motion. The proposed system is applied to a Honda humanoid robot. Real-time performance is successfully demonstrated in real-world experiments.",

The mathematical model of its mechanics is formulated by Euler-Lagrange equations, for which the addition of friction forces is straightforward. Dynamics of the hydraulic system is modeled upon first principle laws, which concern flow through orifices and fluid compressibility. These models lead to a set of equations with various unknown parameters, which are related to the inertias, masses, location of center of masses, friction forces, and valve coefficients. The numerical values of these parameters are estimated by the use of least-square methods, which is made feasible by transforming the models into linear representations. The results of simulation tests show a significant correspondence between measured and estimated variables, validating our modeling and identification approach.",

For both of the prototypes, high-power electrostatic film motors are installed. The slider of the electrostatic motor works as a crawling belt as well as an electrode for electroadhesion. The first prototype that has a rigid mechanical structure is light in weight (49 g) and thin in thickness (14 mm). It can climb on a vertical aluminum board with a speed up to 104 mm/s and horizontally pull a payload of about 3.2 N. The other prototype is equipped with a flexible mechanical structure that consists of a series of passive joints. By smoothly transitioning from a horizontal floor up to a slope, the robot demonstrated its capability to comply with complicated surfaces.",

        "abstract": "We describe a method of embedding imperceptible codes, that are for structured light sensing (SLS), into regular display in video projection. To resolve the conflict between imperceptibility of the embedded codes and feasibility and robustness of SLS code retrieval, we introduce antinoise schemes to the coding and decoding stages simultaneously. On one hand, specially designed primitive shapes and large Hamming distance are employed in the spatial SLS coding to enhance the error-tolerance capability. On the other hand, pre-trained primitive shape detectors are applied to detect and identify the embedded codes in the decoding stage - a task difficult to achieve by segmentation that is adopted in classical structured light methods, when weakly embedded information is inevitably interfered by noise. Extensive experiments show that the proposed method is effective and accurate in code retrieval, even with the prerequisite of incurring minimum disturbance to arbitrary video projection. Some potential applications to a robotic system are also demonstrated.",

This study presents an initial application of Bayesian perception on an iCub fingertip sensor mounted on a dedicated positioning robot. We systematically probed the test system with five cylindrical stimuli offset by a range of positions relative to the fingertip. Testing the real-time speed and accuracy of shape and position discrimination, we achieved sub-millimeter accuracy with just a few taps. This result is apparently the first explicit demonstration of perceptual hyperacuity in robot touch, in that object positions are perceived more accurately than the taxel spacing. We also found substantial performance gains when the fingertip can reposition itself to avoid poor perceptual locations, which indicates that improved robot perception could mimic active perception in animals.",

        "abstract": "The biological hypothesis of spinal engine states that locomotion is mainly achieved by the spine, while the legs may serve as assistance. Inspired by this hypothesis, a compliant, multiple degree-of-freedom, biologically-inspired spine has been embedded into a quadruped robot, named Kitty, which has no actuation on the legs. In this paper, we demonstrate how versatile behaviors (bounding, trotting, and turning) can be generated exclusively by the spine's movements through dynamical interaction between the controller, the body, and the environment, known as embodiment. Moreover, we introduce information theoretic approach to quantitatively study the spine internal dynamics and its effect on the bounding gait based on three spinal morphologies. These three morphologies differ in the position of virtual spinal joint where the spine is easier to get bent. The experimental results reveal that locomotion can be enhanced by using the spine featuring a rear virtual spinal joint, which offers more freedom for the rear legs to move forward. In addition, the information theoretic analysis shows that, according to the morphological differences of the spine, the information structure changes. The relationship between the observed behavior of the robot and the corresponding information structure is discussed in detail.",

On the other hand, human can produce a stepping motion not only depend on the legs, but also the rotation of the Center of Mass, arm-swing, the motion of the torso and so on. In this paper, a three dimensional quasi-passive dynamic walking provoked by rocking motion in lateral plane has been investigated. The behavioral analyses with the robot experiments show that this robot can walk on a flat ground and a gait speed is related to the period of lateral rocking.",

        "abstract": "This paper presents a novel approach to emptying a basket filled with a pile of objects. Form, size, position, orientation and constellation of the objects are unknown. Additional challenges are to localize the basket and treat it as an obstacle, and to cope with incomplete point cloud data. There are three key contributions. First, we introduce Height Accumulated Features (HAF) which provide an efficient way of calculating grasp related feature values. The second contribution is an extensible machine learning system for binary classification of grasp hypotheses based on raw point cloud data. Finally, a practical heuristic for selection of the most robust grasp hypothesis is introduced. We evaluate our system in experiments where a robot was required to autonomously empty a basket with unknown objects on a pile. Despite the challenging scenarios, our system succeeded each time.",

        "abstract": "Recent attempts at designing untethered devices for locomotion inside compliant biological vessels, highlighted the requirements for energy efficiency for prolonged duration inside living bodies. Quite a number of studies considered the design and construction of crawling robots but very few focused on the interaction between the robots and the flexible environment. In previous studies, we derived the efficiency, defined as the actual advance divided by the optimal advance, of worm locomotion. In this paper, we analyze the force, minimum energy and power requirements for worm locomotion over flexible surfaces. More importantly, we determine the optimum conditions of locomotion as a function of the number of cells, friction coefficients, stroke length, energy recovery factor, and tangential compliance. Optimality is defined with respect to energy and power requirements. The analytical results are obtained by integrating the force over the actuator motion and alternatively by summing up the overall energy losses due to friction and elastic losses with the surface and the efficient work performed by the robot. The theoretical predictions are compared to numerical simulations modeling worm robots crawling over flexible surfaces and are found in perfect match.",

        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "The adaptation of robots to changing tasks has been explored in modular self-reconfigurable robot research, where the robot structure is altered by adapting the connectivity of its constituent modules. As these modules are generally complex and large, an upper bound is imposed on the resolution of the built structures. Inspired by growth of plants or animals, robotic body extension (RBE) based on hot melt adhesives allows a robot to additively fabricate and assemble tools, and integrate them into its own body. This enables the robot to achieve tasks which it could not achieve otherwise. The RBE tools are constructed from hot melt adhesives and therefore generally small and only passive. In this paper, we seek to show physical extension of a robotic system in the order of magnitude of the robot, with actuation of integrated body parts, while maintaining the ability of RBE to construct parts with high resolution. Therefore, we present an enhancement of RBE based on hot melt adhesives with modular units, combining the flexibility of RBE with the advantages of simple modular units. We explain the concept of this new approach and demonstrate with two simple unit types, one fully passive and the other containing a single motor, how the physical range of a robot arm can be extended and additional actuation can be added to the robot body.",

The labrum is a central needle which sucks blood; two maxillae are left/right needles aside the labrum, respectively. They cooperatively move, i.e., one maxilla goes forward, labrum goes forward, another maxilla goes forward, successively. We noticed that the maxilla has a jagged harpoon-like shape on its tip area, which has an anchoring effect. We proposed the easy insertion mechanism as follows: the equivalent stiffness, which is the ratio of the resistance force relative to the moving distance, is considered. The total stiffness in pushing out the central needle can be made smaller than zero due to the anchoring effect of the side needles. We named it as \u201cnegative stiffness mechanism.\u201d Equivalent stiffness during pulling/pushing a fabricated needle was experimentally estimated, which indicated the validity of proposed mechanism.",

The device, which consists of an ultrasound probe mounted to a backlash-free ball screw actuator and driven by a compact servo motor, maintains a prescribed contact force between the ultrasound probe and patient's body. A control system which combines both a position and a force controller enables ergonomic operation by keeping the actuator centered within its range of motion and permits the repeated making and breaking of probe-patient contact. By controlling ultrasound probe contact force and consequently the amount of tissue deformation, the system enhances the repeatability, usability, and diagnostic capabilities of ultrasound imaging.",

        "abstract": "In this paper, we present a monocular, texture-based method for person detection and upper-body orientation classification. We build on a commonly used approach for person recognition that uses a Support Vector Machine (SVM) on Histograms of Oriented Gradients (HOG) [1] but replace the SVM by a decision tree with SVMs as binary decision makers. Thereby, in addition to the pure detection of persons, the distinction of eight upper-body orientation classes is enabled. The detection of humans and the estimation of their upper-body orientation from larger distances is essential for socially acceptable navigation of mobile robots. It permits to estimate the human's notice of the robot or even the human's interest in an interaction. Thus, it is the basis for the decision whether to approach or to avoid a human. By using an SVM decision tree for upper-body orientation estimation in discrete steps of 45\u00b0, we were able to classify about 64% of the test samples with an absolute error of less than 22.5\u00b0. This performance is much better than the results we obtained with comparable methods. Furthermore, our approach proved to be faster than the other state-of-the-art methods. This is of high relevance for implementation on mobile robots with limited computational resources.",

This paper aims at applying the statically equivalent serial chain (SESC) method to obtain CoM position using widely available and portable hardware; a Microsoft's Kinect and a Nintendo's Wii balance board. During identification, CoM is approximated by CoP measurements and the virtual chain is created for able-bodied subjects. The result demostrates that the SESC method can be applied outside the laboratory environment using a Kinect. Cross-validation of the identified model was performed to evaluate the accuracy of the method. Results obtained of five subjects are shown and discussed.",

        "abstract": "This paper focuses on motion estimation using inertial measurements and observations of naturally occurring point features. To date, this task has primarily been addressed using filtering methods, which track the system state starting from known initial conditions. However, when no prior knowledge of the initial system state is available, (e.g., at the onset of the system's operation), the existing approaches are not applicable. To address this problem, in this work we present algorithms for computing the system's observable quantities (platform attitude and velocity, feature positions, and IMU-camera calibration) directly from the sensor measurements, without any prior knowledge. A key contribution of this work is a convex-optimization based algorithm for computing the rotation matrix between the camera and IMU. We show that once this rotation matrix has been computed, all remaining quantities can be determined by solving a quadratically constrained least-squares problem. To increase their accuracy, the initial estimates are refined by an iterative maximum-likelihood estimator.",

        "abstract": "This paper proposes a novel approach to risk assessment at road intersections. Unlike most approaches in the literature, it does not rely on trajectory prediction. Instead, dangerous situations are identified by comparing what drivers intend to do with what they are expected to do. Driver intentions and expectations are estimated from the joint motion of the vehicles, taking into account the layout of the intersection and the traffic rules at the intersection. The proposed approach was evaluated in simulation with two vehicles involved in typical collision scenarios. An analysis of the collision prediction horizon allows to characterize the efficiency of the approach in different situations, as well as the potential of different strategies to avoid an accident after a dangerous situation is detected.",

Furthermore these descriptor-classifier combinations have to hold an in-depth evaluation to show their discriminative power and robustness in real world scenarios. Our analysis incorporates detailed accuracy measurements on sparse and noisy point clouds representing typical indoor setups for mobile robot tasks and considers the resource consumption to assure real-time processing.",

We succeeded in controlling movement of surface swarming by ratchet shape micro channel and then driving the micro gear in the closed micro channel. As a next step, to transmit power of rotational movement, we fabricated the open micro channel and micro object (floating pillar, micro gear etc.) and succeeded in driving the object in the open micro channel. In addition, we revealed that rotational power of floating pillar by deformation of nano probe. Finally, we assembled the micro gear with shaft like crank. Therefore, it became possible transmitting the power from rotational movement to outside. Thus, we achieved to construct base of bio-motor.",

We developed a tele-operation system where the lip motion of a remote humanoid robot is automatically controlled from the operator's voice. In the present work, we introduce an improved version of our proposed speech-driven lip motion generation method, where lip height and width degrees are estimated based on vowel formant information. The method requires the calibration of only one parameter for speaker normalization. Lip height control is evaluated in two types of humanoid robots (Telenoid-R2 and Geminoid-F). Subjective evaluation indicated that the proposed audio-based method can generate lip motion with naturalness superior to vision-based and motion capture-based approaches. Partial lip width control was shown to improve lip motion naturalness in Geminoid-F, which also has an actuator for stretching the lip corners. Issues regarding online real-time processing are also discussed.",

        "abstract": "Autonomous intersection management (AIM) is a new intersection control protocol that exploits the capabilities of autonomous vehicles to control traffic at intersections in a way better than traffic signals and stop signs. A key assumption of this protocol is that vehicles can always follow their trajectories. But mechanical failures can occur in real life, causing vehicles to deviate from their trajectories. A previous approach for handling mechanical failure was to prevent vehicles from entering the intersection after the failure. However, this approach cannot prevent collisions among vehicles already in the intersection or too close to stop because (1) the lack of coordination among vehicles can cause collisions during the execution of evasive actions; and (2) the intersection may not have enough room for evasive actions. In this paper, we propose a preemptive approach that pre-computes evasion plans for several common types of mechanical failures before vehicles enter an intersection. This preemptive approach is necessary because there are situations in which vehicles cannot evade without pre-allocation of space for evasion. We present a modified AIM protocol and demonstrate the effectiveness of evasion plan execution on a miniature autonomous intersection testbed.",

Classically, the control of biped robots has been separated into walking pattern generation and stabilizing control. While this is an effective strategy in well-known environments, walking in rough, unmodelled terrain can easily destabilize the system. Findings from neurobiology suggest that gait generation in animals and humans is strongly linked to sensory signals indicating certain events in the gait cycle. We therefore propose an event-based controller that triggers phase transitions based on the sensed walking state instead of only relying on time-based reference trajectories. We have implemented the proposed approach on our humanoid robot Lola. We present simulations and experimental results demonstrating the effectiveness of the approach when walking over unknown obstacles.",

We report on a thorough analysis of the household domain, which has been performed on a large corpus of natural-language instructions from the Web and underlines the supreme need of action-specific knowledge for robots acting in those environments. We introduce the concept of Probabilistic Robot Action Cores (PRAC) that are well-suited for encoding such knowledge in a probabilistic first-order knowledge base. We additionally show how such a knowledge base can be acquired by natural language and we address the problems of incompleteness, underspecification and ambiguity of naturalistic action specifications and point out how PRAC models can tackle those.",

        "abstract": "Several methods have been investigated and realized for operation of exoskeleton robots for assistance of human gait. These systems perform motion intention estimation using the bioelectrical signals of muscle activation, body gestures and kinesiological information, or a mixed combination in a hybrid system. For motion intention estimation of the lower limb(s), information of the lower limbs is usually utilized. However, human gait is not only the function of the lower limbs, but also coordination between upper and lower limbs, adding to balance and cognitive functions as well. In this study, we investigate on how to utilize the synergies of upper and lower limbs of human walking in exoskeleton robot control by using the cane (walking aid). We analyse the synergies of human gait with cane in healthy subjects by means of Principal Component Analysis (PCA) in order to investigate the usability of cane for robot-assisted motor rehabilitation. We also implement a semi autonomous control for an exoskeleton robot, single leg version of HAL (Hybrid Assistive Limb) suit, based on the cane and body joint synergies.",

        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "Much attention has been paid to passive dynamic walking as an approach to investigate the walking of human beings and animals. As for quadrupedal passive dynamic walking, it is confirmed that walking resembles that of animals, and that the gait of the robot changes depending on the structure of robot or the environment. Based on these facts, it is conceivable that quadrupedal passive dynamic walking is related to walking of animals, and the walking principle is inherent in passive dynamic walking. In this research, we approach the walking principle through realization of a walking on the level ground by rational-energy input and investigation how gait changes depending on the input. In this paper, a quadrupedal quasi-passive dynamic walking robot named Duke has been developed by applying passive dynamic walking. This robot has only two rolling actuators, which simply provide with rocking motion and not drive the knee or hip joint directly. We conduct walking experiments by Duke with various inputs, and observe its gaits. As a result of walking experiments, it was verified that walking speed was related to the frequency and the phase difference of rocking motion. In addition, through analysis of a shape of soles, we revealed Duke has a nonholonomic constraint that is comparable to that of \u201ctwo-wheeled robot\u201d on its sole. As a result of analyses based on the nonlinear control theory, we conclude that the sole shape contributes to the transition of walking speed accompanying with change of a phase difference.",

        "abstract": "Humans usually distinguish objects by sliding their fingertips on the surface to feel the texture via mechanoreceptor underneath the skin. We have developed a human-imitated system for robotic fingertip to sense object's texture via sliding action. Design of the sensory skin was inspired by the localized displacement phenomenon of a sliding soft fingertip ([1]) to capture stick-slip events on the contact surface that mainly represent texture characteristics. The soft skin is knitted by electro-conductive tension-sensitive yarns, then covered over a hemispherical fingertip. The pile-shaped surface of the fabric sensor enhances tangential traction detection ability of the sensor, even though the normal load is also sensible. Our aim is to exploit this sensor in applications regarding relative sliding between the touched object and the surface of the sensor, such as slip detection ([2]), and surface identification in this paper. In surface encoding, we have experimentally investigated ability of the fabric sensor in recognition touched objects via multiple machine learning algorithms, such as naive Bayes, Multi-Layer Artificial Neural Network (ANN) with input extracted from autoregressive models, and ANN with input extracted from Discrete Wavelet Transformation (DWT), have been trained to distinguish three typical textures. As a result, we have found that the last method outperforms the remains with an average successful rate of 90%.",

Our approach assumes unknown and uncooperative target objects (spacecraft, space debris) and a camera only vision system. The target's 3D structure is reconstructed from a sparse point cloud extracted from a rendezvous-SLAM algorithm and processed by a RANSAC algorithm.

Then, this paper presents a method to detect which kind of robot assistance is needed, thanks to the decoding of haptic cues conveyed by the operator. An experimental study on thirty subjects moving a long object together with a robot that is providing an assistance is introduced. A statistical analysis highlights the relationships between haptic measures and intentions of motion. This analysis shows that wrench measurements constitute an incomplete information to detect the operator's intention of motion.",

Our algorithm is an immediate consequence of deriving a global coordinate chart of finite dimension that suffices to describe all possible configurations of the rod that can be placed in static equilibrium by fixing the position and orientation of each end. Hardware experiments confirm this derivation in the case where the \u201crod\u201d is a thin, flexible strip of metal that has a fixed base and that is held at the other end by an industrial robot. We show an example in which a path of the robot that was planned by our algorithm causes the metal strip to move between given start and goal configurations while remaining in quasi-static equilibrium.",

In previous work, this is typically hand-coded and limited to flat horizontal surfaces. In contrast, we propose to use a more general model for 3D context and learn the relationship between 3D context and different object classes. This way, we can capture more complex 3D contexts without implementing specialized routines. We present extensive experiments with both qualitative and quantitative evaluations of our method for different object classes. We show that our method can be used in conjunction with an object detection algorithm to reduce the rate of false positives. Our results support that the 3D structure surrounding objects in everyday scenes is a strong indicator of their placement and that it can give significant improvements in the performance of, for example, an object detection system. For evaluation, we have collected a large dataset of Microsoft Kinect frames from five different locations, which we also make publicly available.",

        "abstract": "Throwing is a complex and highly dynamic task. Humans usually exploit passive dynamics of their limbs to optimize their movement and muscle activation. In order to approach human throwing, we developed a double pendulum robotic platform. To introduce passivity into the actuated joints, clutches were included in the drive train. In this paper, we demonstrate the advantage of exploiting passive dynamics in reducing the mechanical work. However, engaging and disengaging the clutches are done in discrete fashions. Therefore, we propose an optimization approach which can deal with such discontinuities. It is shown that properly engaging/disengaging the clutches can reduce the mechanical work of a throwing task. The result is compared to the solution of fully actuated double pendulum, both in simulation and experiment.",

A dynamic relationship between generalized external forces acting on the structure and the system motion, which is specified in terms of Cartesian space coordinates, is provided. Through a suitable choice of such variables and with respect to a given task, thanks to the added degrees of freedom given by the robot arm attached to the UAV, it is possible to exploit the redundancy of the system so as to perform some useful subtasks. The hovering control of a quadrotor, equipped with a 3-DOF robotic arm and subject to contact forces and external disturbances acting on some points of the whole structure, is tested in a simulated case study.",

Common experience with dynamic robotic simulations suggests that the numerical robustness of the LCP solver often determines simulation usability: if the solver fails to find a solution or finds a solution with significant residual error, interpenetration can result, the simulation can gain energy, or both. This paper undertakes the first comprehensive evaluation of LCP solvers across the space of multi-rigid body contact problems. We evaluate the performance of these solvers along the dimensions of solubility, solution quality, and running time.",

        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "Modern robotics systems rely on distributed event-based frameworks to facilitate the assembly of software out of collections of reusable components. These frameworks express component dependencies in data that encode event publish-subscribe relations. This loosely coupled architecture makes it difficult for developers to understand the dependencies and to predict the impacts of a change to a component as the components grow in number and complexity. Moreover, this encoding of dependencies renders traditional techniques for analyzing component dependencies inapplicable, because the dependencies are bound by communication channels rather than data. In this work, we present a program analysis technique that automatically extracts a model of component dependencies from distributed system source code. This model identifies not only the temporal dependencies among components, but also the conditions under which those dependencies are realized. We have implemented the analysis and applied it to systems developed in ROS. The resulting models are succinct and precise, which suggests that programmers will find them comprehensible, and they can be used to document important global dependencies in a system, to compare different versions to identify the impacts of component changes, and to help locate errors.",

        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "Functional electrical stimulation (FES) is able to restore motor function of spinal cord injured (SCI) patients. To make adaptive FES control taking into account the actual muscle state with muscular feedback information, torque estimation and prediction are important to be provided beforehand. Evoked EMG (eEMG) has been found to be highly correlated with FES-induced torque under various muscle conditions, indicating that it can be an useful tool for torque/force prediction. To better construct the relationship between eEMG and stimulated muscular torque, nonlinear-arx-type (NARX-type) model is preferred. This paper presents and exploits a NARX-type recurrent neural network (NARX-RNN) model for identification and prediction of FES-induced muscular dynamics with eEMG. Such NARX-RNN model is with a novel architecture for prediction, with robust prediction performance. To make fast convergence for identification of such NARX-RNN, directly-learning pattern is exploited during the learning phase. Due to difficulty of choosing a proper forgetting factor of Kalman filter for predicting time-variant torque with eEMG, such NARX-RNN may be considered to be a better alternative as torque predictor. Data gathered from two SCI patients is used to evaluate the proposed NARX-RNN model. The NARX-RNN model shows promising estimation and prediction performance only based on eEMG.",

        "abstract": "Building robots capable of long term autonomy has been a long standing goal of robotics research. Such systems must be capable of performing certain tasks with a high degree of robustness and repeatability. In the context of personal robotics, these tasks could range anywhere from retrieving items from a refrigerator, loading a dishwasher, to setting up a dinner table. Given the complexity of tasks there are a multitude of failure scenarios that the robot can encounter, irrespective of whether the environment is static or dynamic. For a robot to be successful in such situations, it would need to know how to recover from failures or when to ask a human for help. This paper, presents a novel shared autonomy behavioral executive to addresses these issues. We demonstrate how this executive combines generalized logic based recovery and human intervention to achieve continuous failure free operation. We tested the systems over 250 trials of two different use case experiments. Our current algorithm drastically reduced human intervention from 26% to 4% on the first experiment and 46% to 9% on the second experiment. This system provides a new dimension to robot autonomy, where robots can exhibit long term failure free operation with minimal human supervision. We also discuss how the system can be generalized.",

        "abstract": "We introduce a fast Nearest Neighbor Search (NNS) algorithm using an Approximate Cached k-d tree (ACk-d tree) structure for low dimensional data sets. The search process of the standard k-d tree starts from the root node and employs a tentative back-tracking search. In contrast, the proposed method begins to search at the appropriate leaf node (cached node) and applies a depth-first nontentative search. This method improves searching speed, with tradeoff of the searching accuracy. To get a proper starting node, the proposed method is based on two properties: i) The ith query point is likely to be close to the (i-1)th query point, ii) The ith query point is likely to be close to the ith model point. These properties are rather right, in case of practical 3D point sets which are consecutively acquired from 3D point sensors (e.g. a stereo camera, the Kinect sensor, and LIDAR). Results show that the search time of the proposed method is superior to other variants of k-d tree for practical point data sets.",

        "abstract": "This paper presents a real-time contour tracking and object segmentation algorithm for 3D range images. The algorithm is used to control a novel micro-mirror based imaging laser scanner, which provides a dynamic trade-off between resolution and frame rate. The micro-mirrors are controllable, enabling us to speed up acquisition significantly by only sampling on the object that is tracked and of interest. As the hardware is under development, we benchmark our algorithms on data from a SICK LMS100-10000 laser scanner mounted on a tilting platform. We find that objects are tracked and segmented well on pixel-level; that frame rate/resolution can be increased 3-4 times through our approach compared to scanners having static scan trajectories, and that the algorithm runs in 30 ms/image on a Intel Core i7 CPU using a single core.",

        "abstract": "Three-dimensional (3D) data processing has recently acquired greater importance in solving complex tasks such as object recognition, environment modeling, and robotic mapping and localization. Since using raw 3D data without preprocessing is very time-consuming, extraction of geometric features that describe the environment concisely is essential. A plane is a suitable geometric feature due to its richness and simplicity of extraction. This paper presents an online incremental plane extraction method using line segments. Since our system is based on a nodding laser scanner, we exploit the incremental nature of data acquisition in which physical rotation and algorithm implementation are conducted in parallel. In contrast to other plane extraction methods, line segments defined by two end points become supporting elements that comprise a plane, so we need not handle all the scan points once the line segments are extracted from each scan slice. This reduces the algorithms complexity and the computation time. Experimental validation and comparison with state of the art method were conducted using tens of complete scan data sets acquired from a typical indoor environment.",

The algorithm works in real-time on unknown and noisy data, without any initial assumption. An iterative cluster growing technique is proposed in order to correctly classify a flow of 3D points and to merge close regions. The computational efficiency of the approach is achieved by using an Incremental Principal Component Analysis (IPCA) technique, and with the adoption of a compact geometrical representation based on the concave-hull computation of each cluster. This solution adds a more realistic representation of the observed environment and reduces the number of points needed to identify the cluster shape. The effectiveness of the proposed algorithm has been validated with both synthetic and real data sets.",

However, the computational complexity of IK is too high to be implemented in large DOF systems. IK of multi-body system is often formulated as nonlinear optimization to minimize the residuals from the references. It usually requires the computation of the gradient vector of the evaluation function. In the method, the computation of the gradient is decomposed into two parts. First, the residuals are considered as external forces and are distributed to each link. Then, the gradient can be computed from static equilibrium by the recursive Newton-Euler algorithm. In addition with the efficient direction search algorithms of nonlinear programing, the computation complexity of IK can be dramatically reduced. The results of numerical evaluation using a large-DOF manipulator and a human musculoskeletal model are shown.",

        "abstract": "In order to achieve good and timely volumetric mapping for mobile robots, we improve the speed and accuracy of multi-resolution voxel map building from 3D data. Mobile robot capabilities, such as SLAM and path planning, often involve algorithms that query a map many times and this lookup is often the bottleneck limiting the execution speed. As such, fast spatial proximity queries has been the topic of much active research. Various data structures have been researched including octrees, k-d trees, approximate nearest neighbours and even dense 3D arrays. We tackle this problem by extending previous work that stores the map as a hash table containing occupied voxels at multiple resolutions. We apply Bloom filters to the problem of spatial querying and voxel maps for the example application of SLAM. Their efficacy is demonstrated building 3D maps with both simulated and real 3D point cloud data. Looking up whether a voxel is occupied is three times faster than the hash table and within 10% of the speed of querying a dense 3D array, potentially the upper limit to query speed. Map generation was done with scan to map alignment on simulated depth images, for which the true pose is available. The calculated poses exhibited sub-voxel error of 0.02m and 0.3 degrees for a typical indoor scene with a map resolution of 0.04m.",

We present an approach that works with a single, compact camera and maintains high classification rates that are robust to changes in illumination. Terrain is classified using a bag of visual words (BOVW) created from speeded up robust features (SURF) with a support vector machine (SVM) classifier. We present several novel techniques to augment this approach. A gradient descent inspired algorithm is used to adjust the SURF Hessian threshold to reach a nominal feature density. A sliding window technique is also used to classify mixed terrain images with high resolution. We demonstrate that our approach is suitable for small legged robots by performing real-time terrain classification on LittleDog. The classifier is used to select between predetermined gaits to traverse terrain of varying difficulty. Results indicate that real-time classification in-the-loop is faster than using a single all-terrain gait.",

        "abstract": "In this paper, we derive a globally asymptotically stabilizing feedback control policy for a collection of differential-drive robots under the constraint that every robot receives exactly the same control inputs. We begin by assuming that each robot has a slightly different wheel size, which scales its forward speed and turning rate by a constant that can be found by offline or online calibration. The resulting feedback policy is easy to implement, is robust to standard models of noise, and scales to an arbitrary number (even a continuous ensemble) of robots. We validate this policy with hardware experiments, which additionally reveal that our feedback policy still works when the wheel sizes are unknown and even when the wheel sizes are all approximately identical. These results have possible future application to control of micro- and nano-scale robotic systems, which are often subject to similar constraints.",

        "abstract": "Goal-directed physical assistance to the human is one of the most challenging problems in the area of human-robot interaction. Planning and learning from demonstration represent two conceptually different approaches to achieve goal-directed behavior. Here we examine the properties of a planning-based and a learning-based approach in the context of physical robotic assistance for the prototypical task of cooperative object maneuvering. In order to exploit the complementary strengths of planning and learning-based approaches we derive three novel synergy strategies. The algorithms are experimentally evaluated in a human user study in a planar virtual-reality scenario and in a proof-of-concept study with a human-sized mobile robot with two 7DoF arms. The results show that combinations of planning and learning algorithms are superior over the individual approaches.",

In surgical robotics it would be useful to not only touch, but also be able to maintain a distance from a certain organ. The latter can be done using non-contact sensors such as cameras. The novelty in this paper is the idea of combining forbidden-region virtual fixtures with haptic rendering from streaming point clouds. This is then used to protect as well as remotely touch a beating heart without any a priori knowledge of the heart geometry (such as from CT/MR scans).",

By assuming a simplified imaging model, we propose to address the registrations between images using Fourier-based methods which, unlike feature-based methods, prove well suited to handle the characteristics of forward-looking sonar images, such as low resolution, noise, occlusions and moving shadows. The registration between spatially and temporally distant images resulting from loop-closing situations or registrations in featureless areas are feasible, overcoming the main difficulties of feature-based methods. The problem is cast as a pose-based graph optimization, taking into account the uncertainties of the pairwise registrations and being able to incorporate navigation information. After the optimization, a consistent mosaic from different tracklines is generated with increased resolution and higher signal-to-noise ratio than the original images, while the vehicle motion in x,y and heading is also estimated.",

        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "In the last years monocular SLAM has been widely used to obtain highly accurate maps and trajectory estimations of a moving camera. However, one of the issues of this approach is that, due to the impossibility of the depth being measured in a single image, global scale is not observable and scene and camera motion can only be recovered up to scale. This problem gets aggravated as we deal with larger scenes since it is more likely that scale drift arises between different map portions and their corresponding motion estimates. To compute the absolute scale we need to know some kind of dimension of the scene (e.g., actual size of an element of the scene, velocity of the camera or baseline between two frames) and somehow integrate it in the SLAM estimation. In this paper, we present a method to recover the scale of the scene using an omnidirectional camera mounted on a helmet. The high precision of visual SLAM allows the head vertical oscillation during walking to be perceived in the trajectory estimation. By performing a spectral analysis on the camera vertical displacement, we can measure the step frequency. We relate the step frequency to the speed of the camera by an empirical formula based on biomedical experiments on human walking. This speed measurement is integrated in a particle filter to estimate the current scale factor and the 3D motion estimation with its true scale. We evaluated our approach using image sequences acquired while a person walks. Our experiments show that the proposed approach is able to cope with scale drift.",

        "abstract": "We propose an adaptive walking assistance strategy to control an exoskeleton robot. In our proposed framework, we explicitly consider the following: 1) the diversity of user motions (style) and 2) the interactions among a user, a robot, and an environment. To spatially coordinate a wide variety of user motions and robot behaviors, we estimated style parameters from observed user movements. To temporally coordinate the interactions among the user, the robot, and the environment, we synchronized the phases of these three systems with a coupled oscillator model. The estimated style parameters and the phase of the user motion can be used to predict future user movements. We investigated how movement prediction and phase synchronization can be beneficial to control an exoskeleton robot. To evaluate our adaptive walking assistance strategy, we developed simulated user and exoskeleton models. The physical interactions among the user, the exoskeleton, and the ground models are introduced in the simulated system. We show that the necessary torque for the user walking movement was reduced around 40% by using our proposed method to control the exoskeleton model.",

        "abstract": "Symbolic grounding is a bridge between high-level planning and actual robot sensing, and actuation. Uncertainties raised by the unstructured environment make a bottleneck for integrating traditional artificial intelligence with service robotics. This paper presents a fuzzy logic based approach to formalise the grounding problems into a fuzzy optimization problem, which is robust to uncertainties. Novel techniques are applied to establish the objective function, to model fuzzy constraints and to perform fuzzy optimisation. The outcome is tested with a service robot fetch and carry task, where the fuzzy optimisation approach helps the robot to determine the most comfortable position (location and orientation) for grasping objects. Experimental results show that the proposed approach improves the robustness of the task implementation in unstructured environments.",

        "abstract": "It was clarified that speeding-up of passive dynamic walking (PDW) of a combined rimless wheel (CRW) can be achieved by adjustment of the phase difference between the fore and rear legs. We discussed the mechanism from the viewpoint of overcoming potential barrier, and showed that the trajectory of the whole center of mass (CoM) is significantly flattened by choosing the phase difference. This paper investigates the potentiality of speeding-up the CRW without having the phase difference but by using a passive wobbling mass that vibrates up and down in the body in expectation of flattening the whole CoM trajectory. We show that the walking speed is increased by the effect of the wobbling mass and that a transition from anti-phase to in-phase oscillation arises with the increase of the elasticity. We also show nonlinear characteristics such a high sensitivity to initial conditions and hysteresis phenomenon. Furthermore, the validity of the simulation results is verified using an experimental CRW machine.",

        "abstract": "When calibrating a camera, the radial component of lens distortion is the dominant source of image distortion. To model this lens distortion, camera models incorporate a radial distortion model that conforms to a certain parametric form. In practice however, multiple parametric forms can be used to model distortion for a given lens. Ideally, one would choose the best suited parametric form using a model selection procedure. In this work, we propose the use of Gaussian Process regression to model lens distortion. With the use of a squared exponential covariance function, a Gaussian Process (GP) can describe the space of smooth distortion functions; kernel hyperparameter selection in this space then analogous to performing explicit model selection between possible parametric models. Our evaluation shows that this Gaussian Process formulation of lens distortion performs on par with parametric distortion models.",

In this paper we present an imitation learning approach for learning and generalizing grasping skills based on human demonstrations. To this end, we split the task of synthesizing a grasping motion into three parts: (1) learning efficient grasp representations from human demonstrations, (2) warping contact points onto new objects, and (3) optimizing and executing the reach-and-grasp movements. We learn low-dimensional latent grasp spaces for different grasp types, which form the basis for a novel extension to dynamic motor primitives. These latent-space dynamic motor primitives are used to synthesize entire reach-and-grasp movements. We evaluated our method on a real humanoid robot. The results of the experiment demonstrate the robustness and versatility of our approach.",

As the robot travels along its path, it identifies both where the environment is changing, and how fast it is changing. The algorithm then morphs the robot's path online to concentrate on the dynamic areas in the environment in proportion to their rate of change. A Lyapunov-like stability proof is used to show that, under our proposed path shaping algorithm, the path converges to a locally optimal configuration according to a Voronoi-based coverage criterion. The path shaping algorithm is then combined with a previously introduced speed controller to produce guaranteed persistent monitoring trajectories for a robot in an unknown dynamic environment. Simulation and experimental results with a quadrotor robot support the proposed approach.",

A general internal model (GIM) is adopted as a universal central pattern generator (CPG). Based on the universal function approximation ability and the temporal/spatial scalabilities of GIM, biomimetic learning is performed such that the robotic fish is able to learn to generate the same or similar fish swimming motion patterns.

The presented work is focused on the underlying optimal assignment problem of the multi-robot task allocation that is addressed by three state-of-the art approaches. In addition, we propose a novel exploration strategy considering allocation of all current goals (not only immediate goal) for each robot, which leads to the multiple traveling salesman problem formulation. Although the problem is strongly NP-hard, we show its approximate solution is computationally feasible and its overall requirements are competitive to the previous approaches. The proposed approach and three well-known approaches are compared in series of problems considering various numbers of robots and sensor ranges.

Programming by demonstration offers an expressive means for teaching while being accessible to domain experts who may be novices in robotics. This work investigates a programming by demon- stration approach to learning motion trajectories for robotic manipulator tasks. Using a graph constructed to determine correspondences between multiple imperfect demonstrations, the robot learner plans novel trajectories that safely and smoothly generalize the teacher's behavior, while attenuating those imperfections. The learner also actively detects instances of diverging strategy between examples, requesting advice for resolving these ambiguities. We demonstrate our approach in example domains with a 7 degree-of-freedom manipulator.",

        "abstract": "In this paper, a method for determining ground plane features in a sequence of images captured by a mobile camera is presented. The hardware of the mobile system consists of a monocular camera that is mounted on an inertial measurement unit (IMU). An image processing procedure is proposed, first to extract image features and match them across consecutive image frames, and second to detect the ground plane features using a two-step algorithm. In the first step, the planar homography of the ground plane is constructed using an IMU-camera motion estimation approach. The obtained homography constraints are used to detect the most likely ground features in the sequence of images. To reject the remaining outliers, as the second step, a new plane normal vector computation approach is proposed. To obtain the normal vector of the ground plane, only three pairs of corresponding features are used for a general camera transformation. The normal-based computation approach generalizes the existing methods that are developed for specific camera transformations. Experimental results on real data validate the reliability of the proposed method.",

In this paper we introduce an internal body model for the control of a hexapod walker. The internal model deals with a highly complex robotic structure of 22 degrees of freedom and coordinates the single joint movements to achieve an overall stable and adaptive walking behavior. It is implemented as a hierarchical recurrent neural network consisting of different levels of abstraction which are tightly intertwined. We demonstrate the feasibility of the concept by applying the model to a simulated robot and show how the different levels of the body model interact and how this allows to scale the model even further. While the internal model is used in this context explicitly for motor control, it is also a predictive model and can be applied for sensor fusion. We discuss how in this way such an internal model offers the flexibility to be utilized in motor control and to be used for planning ahead by a cognitive expansion of the movement controller.",

        "abstract": "We propose a novel method for a robot to separate and segment objects in a cluttered tabletop environment. The method leverages the fact that external object boundaries produce visible edges within an object cluster. We achieve this singulation of objects by using the robot arm to perform pushing actions specifically selected to test whether particular visible edges correspond to object boundaries. We verify the separation of objects after a push by examining the clusters formed by geometric segmentation of regions residing on the table surface. To avoid explicitly representing and tracking edges across push behaviors we aggregate over all edges in a given orientation by representing the push-history as an orientation histogram. By tracking the history of directions pushed for each object cluster we can build evidence that a cluster cannot be further separated. We present quantitative and qualitative experimental results performed in a real home environment by a mobile manipulator using input from an RGB-D camera mounted on the robot's head. We show that our pushing strategy can more reliably obtain singulation in fewer pushes than an approach, that does not explicitly reason about boundary information.",

        "abstract": "In this paper, we demonstrate data-driven inference of mechanical properties of objects using a tactile sensor array (skin) covering a robot's forearm. We focus on the mobility (sliding vs. fixed), compliance (soft vs. hard), and identity of objects in the environment, as this information could be useful for efficient manipulation and search. By using the large surface area of the forearm, a robot could potentially search and map a cluttered volume more efficiently, and be informed by incidental contact during other manipulation tasks. Our approach tracks a contact region on the forearm over time in order to generate time series of select features, such as the maximum force, contact area, and contact motion. We then process and reduce the dimensionality of these time series to generate a feature vector to characterize the contact. Finally, we use the k-nearest neighbor algorithm (k-NN) to classify a new feature vector based on a set of previously collected feature vectors. Our results show a high cross-validation accuracy in both classification of mechanical properties and object recognition. In addition, we analyze the effect of taxel resolution, duration of observation, feature selection, and feature scaling on the classification accuracy.",

        "abstract": "Manipulations of submicron objects on a surface with a scanning force probe required a precise localization and shape recognition in order to perform controlled displacements and/or actions on them. As these submicron objects are closed to the optical detection limit of classical optical microscopy, we propose to combine an AFM tip mounted on a quartz tuning fork resonator and a high performance haptic system. The whole system acts as a nano-finger/tool. In this paper two main configurations of the haptic coupling have been tested: (1) a full manual control configuration where the operator pilots manually the AFM probe displacements in (X,Y,Z) directions and then feels and adjusts the tip-surface interaction, (2) a collaborative human-robot configuration where the operator pilots only (X,Y) directions while the standard feedback loop of the AFM probe controls the tip-sample interaction to keep it constant. In both cases, the experimentalist successes in a localization task while in the recognition task the assisted configuration (2) only provides reliable and reproducible results without tip damage. A critical analysis of the results and the haptic recognition process is reported in the last section to discuss about the haptic representation based only on the vertical direction while the common and classical representation is based on the normal direction of the sample surface. Finally a third configuration to pass from localization and recognition mode to nano-manipulation mode is proposed.",

Eventually, this device will be a tool to study string instruments in playing conditions. We use a classical robot with two degrees of freedom enhanced with silicone fingertips. The validation method requires a comparison with real harpist performance. A specific experimental setup using a high-speed camera combined with an accelerometer was carried out. It provides finger and string trajectories during the whole plucking action and the soundboard vibrations during the string oscillations. A set of vibrational features are then extracted from these signals to compare robotic finger to harpist plucking actions. These descriptors have been analyzed on six fingertips of various shapes and hardnesses. Results allow to select the optimal shape and hardness among the silicone fingertips according to vibrational features.",

We are here interested in the robotic-assisted minimally-invasive surgical scenario, for which feature matching can be used to recover tracked features after prolonged occlusions, strong illumination changes, image clutter, or fast camera motion. In this paper we introduce the Hierarchical Multi-Affine (HMA) feature-matching algorithm, which improves over the existing methods by recovering a larger number of image correspondences, at an increased speed and with a higher accuracy and robustness. Extensive experimental results are presented that compare HMA against existing methods, over a large surgical-image dataset and over several types of detected features.",

        "abstract": "Humanoid robots have abilities of stepping over or onto obstacles, which is different from wheeled robots. However it may be difficult to apply the ordinary motion planning methods such as Rapidly-exploring Random Trees (RRT) to humanoid robots directly. Because these kinds of methods only consider to circumvent obstacles and ignore the constraint of balance. Aiming at dealing with these problems in one frame, a novel approach based on hierarchical RRT is used to plan the footstep for humanoid robots. It is designed according to three basic constraints: a transition model based gait generator, an inverted pendulum based balance controller and a collision detection based path planner. First, a set of layered transition model is utilized to revise the footstep according to the terrain condition, which is able to take full use of the motion ability as well as improve the efficiency. Then, a hierarchical strategy is exploited to select the feasible foot location to be added in the random tree based on the results of collision checking and balance control. Finally, a dynamic RRT method is introduced in our work to revise paths in changing environments. Different experiments are given to verify the feasibility and performance of the proposed approach in complicated environments with both dynamic and static obstacles.",

Most of the prior works primarily focus on recognizing individual activity, thus requiring high cost to track people and performs not well when there are multiple users, which is common in a real home environment. Therefore, we propose hierarchical generalized context inference to infer multi-user contexts. By treating a multi-user context as a generalized context caused by an aggregated entity, our approach generalizes these multi-user contexts with different information granularity, and then dynamically infers and aggregates these generalized contexts. Based on the inference results of generalized contexts, a context-aware smart home can provide appropriate services as much as possible. Our experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.",

The total coverage of the domain is proven, and the good performance of the approach is supported with simulations.",

High speed cell manipulation, including patterning and concentration control by DEP is demonstrated. Movable microstructure embedding cells is on-chip fabricated. Several microelectrodes are fabricated by Indium Tin Oxides (ITO) and Cr/Au. The two kinds of DEP responses of yeast cell (W303) and other particles are experimentally confirmed. Based on negative DEP phenomenon, line and circle patterns of cells and microbeads are high speed performed. Cell manipulation for patterning is completed within 1 second. The on-chip fabrication of movable microstructures embedding cells based on Poly Ethylene Glycol Diacrylate (PEG-DA) is reported. The microfluidic chip with separated patterning and fabrication areas is fabricated. With the cell concentration control by DEP and on-chip fabrication method, movable microstructures embedding microbeads of which the concentration is controllable are fabricated in the microfluidic channel, inside PEG-DA and NaCl solution.",

The robot trajectory (path and speed) is generated on-line by avoiding obstacles optimally one at a time. This reduces the original problem from one with m obstacles to m simpler problems with one obstacle each, thus resulting in a planner that is linear, instead of exponential, in the number of obstacles. While this approach is quite general and applicable to any cost function and to any robot dynamics, it is treated here for minimum time motions, a point mass robot, and planar circular obstacles.",

In this study the sunfish was selected as a biological model from which to understand pectoral fin motions and forces during hover. The kinematic patterns of the biological fin were identified and implemented on a biorobotic model of the fin. The effects of fin patterns and mechanical properties on force were evaluated. Pressure was measured at multiple points on the fin's surface and assessed for use in the closed loop control of fin force. The study revealed that a wide range of motions are used during hover, and that forces are significantly different from those found previously for steady swimming. However as fin speeds increase, the fin's dynamic motions, and the magnitude and direction of the forces become more similar to those of steady swimming. Collective measures of pressure over the fin's surface exhibited trends that correlated well with fin forces in relative magnitudes and directions. Results strongly suggest that distributed measures of pressure are useful for force prediction and control.",

We present it in the case of a linear impedance controller but it can be generalized to more complex impedances. Desired trajectories are decomposed into sequences of elementary motion primitives.

        "abstract": "This work presents human-inspired control strategies required for achieving three motion primitives in walking\u2014flat-ground, uneven terrain and up-slope\u2014in an underactuated physical bipedal robot: AMBER. Formal models and controllers which provably guarantee the stability of walking are developed and verified in the simulation. Computationally tractable conditions are given that allow for the experimental implementation of these formal methods through the closed form approximation of constraints that restrict maximum torque, maximum velocity and ensure proper foot clearance. Considering the special property of the motors used in the robot, i.e., low leakage inductance and high angular speed, we approximate the motor model and translate the formal controllers satisfying these constraints into an efficient voltage-based controller that can be directly implemented on AMBER. The end result is robotic walking on AMBER for the three motion primitives that shows good agreement with the formal results from which it was derived.",

        "abstract": "We address the problem of robot participation as a team member in group activities. In this human-robot interactive setting, the goal is to enable a robot to detect objects around it using on-board video cameras, and determine which activity they are performing. It then determines how it should move to participate in the activity based on its intended role, derived from domain knowledge, and human instruction. A human controller can initialize, correct and refine the robot's behavior and recognition of surrounding activities. A probabilistic framework is used for joint estimation of the robot's desired motion and the activity surrounding it while incorporating human instruction. Group activities consisting of multiple people moving about the robot with a common goal are used to demonstrate the proposed approach. We focus on activities with geometric structures (line, wedge, echelon, etc.) with an arbitrary number of participants, and handle the noisy observations from video detection and tracking. Results using both simulated and real video data are used to demonstrate activity recognition and incorporating human instruction.",

In these robots, it is very important to assure engineering, biomechanical, and anatomical plausibility at the same time. However, these requirements are often in contradiction. Especially, in the human's shoulder complex, mimicking the glenohumeral joint and the scapulothoracic joint has been difficult because of the need to assure a wide range of movement and the joint's stability at the same time. In this paper, we propose mechanical structures to realize the functions of the glenohumeral joints and scapulothoracic joint. These structures were used to develop a musculoskeletal robot arm driven by pneumatic artificial muscles. In addition, in order to verify the feasibility of the robot arm, we present a dynamic motion in which the robot arm throws a ball by a simple control strategy.",

        "abstract": "Manipulation of structured objects connected to the environment by a kinematics chain involves two problems: (a) The objects have movable directions and unmovable directions. An undesired reaction force in the unmovable directions prevents a robot from successful manipulation; (b) The reaction forces from the objects could fluctuate during manipulation. Related works have enabled robots to manipulate objects by integrating position control in movable directions and force control in unmovable directions at the hands. However, in the case of a humanoid robot, too large undesired reaction forces in movable directions cause the robot's falling down and slipping. In this paper, we propose a controller system controlling reaction forces at the hands and successively updating reference forces based on reaction forces. For problem (a), we apply force control both to the movable and unmovable directions in order to satisfy both maintaining full-body balance and achieving manipulation. For problem (b), the update of the reference forces enables the humanoid robot to adapt to fluctuation of the reaction forces. We show experimental results on the cmanipulating four doors and a drawer.",

By formulating the simultaneous search for a controller and the associated domain of attraction as a single problem, we provide a unified framework in which full-body push recovery controllers can be designed and their performance analyzed. The resulting controller explicitly models external disturbances in the system dynamics and guarantees stabilization under bounded disturbances as well as physical constraints on the robot. Through numerical simulations, we demonstrate full-body push recovery for a planar, three-link, bipedal humanoid in the sagittal plane.",

The focus of this work is throwing an object. It is shown that the full reachable area of the end-effector does not need to be known to achieve the desired velocity when a good collision model of the robot is available. The end-effector velocity (magnitude and direction) is specified as well as a duration of this velocity. A sparse map of reachable end-effector positions in free space and the corresponding poses in joint space is created using random sampling in joint space and forward kinematics. The desired trajectory in free space is placed within the sparse map with the first point of the trajectory being a known pose from the original sparse map. The Jacobian Transpose Controller method of inverse kinematics is then used to find the subsequent points in the trajectory. Each pose in the trajectory is checked against the collision model to guarantee no self-collisions. This method was tested on the 130 cm tall full size humanoid Jaemi Hubo and its virtual representation.",

This new algorithm is compared to a variation of Natural Admittance Control to show the need for the merger of two known algorithms.

These measurements correspond to the angles of pairs of landmarks located on each robot, extracted from camera images. Thus, the only exteroceptive measurements used are the camera images taken by each robot, under the condition that both cameras are mutually visible. An analytical solution is derived, together with an analysis of uncertainty as a function to the relative pose of the robots. A theoretical comparison with a standard stereo camera pose reconstruction is also provided. Finally, the feasibility and performance of the proposed method were validated, through simulations and experiments with a mobile robot setup.",

Such a position has to fulfill different criteria: first, to guarantee the observability of the person with the robots on-board sensors and second, the robot should be able to observe the person when the person changes its position at its resting place. In this paper, a new approach is presented how to find a position, providing all these aspects, by solving an optimization problem using a particle swarm optimizer. We also present first results for that problem in the 2D and 3D case.",

The RoboCup@Work scenarios target difficult, mostly unsolved problems in robotics, artificial intelligence, and advanced computer science, in particular in perception, path planning and motion planning, mobile manipulation, planning and scheduling, learning and adaptivity, and probabilistic modeling, to name just a few. Furthermore, RoboCup@Work scenarios may also address problems for which solutions require the use and integration of semantic web technology, RFID technology, or advanced computational geometry. Examples for the work-related scenarios targeted by RoboCup@Work include: loading and/or unloading of containers with/of objects with the same or different size; pickup or delivery of parts from/to structured storages and/or unstructured heaps; operation of machines, including pressing buttons, opening/closing doors and drawers, and similar operations with underspecified or unknown kinematics; and cooperative assembly and transportation of non-trivial objects, with other robots and/or humans.",

        "abstract": "One of the fundamental challenges in robotics is data-association: determining which sensor observations correspond to the same physical object. A common approach is to consider groups of observations simultaneously: a constellation of observations can be significantly less ambiguous than the observations considered individually. The Joint Compatibility Branch and Bound (JCBB) test is the gold standard method for these data association problems. But its computational complexity and its sensitivity to non-linearities limit its practical usefulness. We propose the Incremental Posterior Joint Compatibility (IPJC) test. While equivalent to JCBB on linear problems, it is significantly more accurate on non-linear problems. When used for feature-cloud matching (an important special case), IPJC is also dramatically faster than JCBB. We demonstrate the advantages of IPJC over JCBB and other commonly-used methods on both synthetic and real-world datasets.",

The obtained model involves if-then formulation and nonlinearities such as flow dynamics and friction because it is derived from mechanical and hydrodynamic equations and is developed with empirical modifications. Via analysis of the hybrid nonlinear system, we can clarify several dominant parameters characterizing the PAM dynamics in terms of steady-state and transient characteristics respectively. Based on the analysis result, then, a reasonable identification procedure can be composed. Furthermore, with a practical testbed system of the PAM system, we validate the proposed procedure producing the hybrid model under several load conditions.",

This problem arises in camera networks when angles between nearby points can be measured but depth measurements are not readily available. We provide contributions for two different variations on this problem. First, when each node is aware of a global coordinate frame, we present a novel method for identifying the components of the problem that are rigidly constrained. Second, in the more difficult case where only relative angles are known, we propose a novel spectral solution that achieves a globally-optimal embedding under transitively-triangular constraints, which we show encompass a wide range of real-world conditions. We demonstrate the utility of our algorithm on both synthetic data and data from quadrotor robot formations.",

To cope with the problem, in this paper, variable impedance control algorithm changing leg impedance parameters according to the change of finite trot states is proposed. The state of quadruped trot is divided into five phases and the impedance parameters are changed to generate adequate response to the contact force in each locomotion phase. Simulation of trotting on irregular terrain with half-ellipsoidal trajectory has been performed with the control groups. The simulation has verified that the proposed control method shows outstanding performance and better stability for trotting on the highly irregular terrain.",

An open loop impedance control law based on contact dynamics model is introduced to realize a desired coefficient of restitution defined between a manipulator hand of a space robot and a contact point on a free-flying target. The coefficient of restitution and the damping ratio are expressed as a function of contact and impedance parameters; and hence, the impedance parameters are tuned by setting a desired coefficient of restitution and a desired damping ratio. The collision experiment using twodimensional microgravity emulator, called air-floating test bed, verifies that the proposed open loop control law is capable of realizing a desired coefficient of restitution with fairly small errors.",

        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "This paper describes the implementation of a haptic system for simulating the force-feedback of a centuries-old musical instrument, the carillon. A carillonneur's performance depends on a developing familiarity with force-feedback associated with a particular instrument. Force-feedback may vary not only across the range of the instrument but from one instrument to another. However, carillonneurs have restricted access to their instrument for rehearsal, unlike musicians who specialise in other instruments. At best, rehearsal times on the actual instrument are shared with other carillonneurs; at worst, a carilloneur rehearses mainly on a practice instrument that does not prepare them for the force-feedback and sonic characteristics of the actual instrument. A haptic device that simulates the force-feedback of a carillon must meet exacting requirements associated with musical performance and musical skill acquisition. Our haptic device uses a voice-coil linear actuator in a position-control loop where the force applied by a carillonneur is measured by analysing the noisy current produced from an analog servo controller reacting to position error. A parametised model of the servo is determined using system identification methods and forms the basis of a Kalman filter for the servo current signal, closing an admittance display loop around carillonneur-applied forces and the mechanical action of the instrument simulated in a virtual environment. This generalised method is particularly applicable to scenarios common in creative applications where hardware is `handed-down' from other projects.",

        "abstract": "This paper investigates the possibility of increasing the robustness of underactuated grasping through the use of variable transmission ratios. We propose a 4-step procedure to investigate and improve the robustness of an underactuated finger on a fixed object. This procedure maximizes the robustness against random force disturbances to the maximum obtainable value under given circumstances. A simulation study is presented that analyzes the disturbance robustness, followed by an experimental study to confirm the effect. The variable transmission ratio is a promising means to increase grasp robustness and has great application potential.",

        "abstract": "In order to successfully climb challenging stair-cases that consist of many steps and contain difficult parts, humanoid robots need to accurately determine their pose. In this paper, we present an approach that fuses the robot's observations from a 2D laser scanner, a monocular camera, an inertial measurement unit, and joint encoders in order to localize the robot within a given 3D model of the environment. We develop an extension to standard Monte Carlo localization (MCL) that draws particles from an improved proposal distribution to obtain highly accurate pose estimates. Furthermore, we introduce a new observation model based on chamfer matching between edges in camera images and the environment model. We thoroughly evaluate our localization approach and compare it to previous techniques in real-world experiments with a Nao humanoid. The results show that our approach significantly improves the localization accuracy and leads to a considerably more robust robot behavior. Our improved proposal in combination with chamfer matching can be generally applied to improve a range-based pose estimate by a consistent matching of lines obtained from vision.",

        "abstract": "The shortcomings of inertial sensor-based localization for mobile robots are discussed and a method to improve the performance of localization is introduced. Because dead reckoning using wheel speed sensors is insufficient for accurate motion estimation in uneven and slippery environments, many studies have used inertial sensors in order to improve the performance of localization. However, inertial sensor-based localization also has inherent problems caused by an accumulation of sensor errors. To improve the performance of inertial sensor-based localization for mobile robots, a method is suggested that involves the reduction of unexpected noise of inertial sensor using a Multiple Estimation Windows (MEW) filter. The main concept of the MEW filter is to estimate the long-term signal of interest using a single long-term moving window and multiple short-term moving windows. The proposed denoising method can reduce the noise of all frequencies without the loss of information from the signal of interest. The performance improvement of the mobile robot's localization using the MEW filter is confirmed experimentally.",

Encoding the structural characteristics of an object allows us to retain low local variations while keeping the benefit of global representativeness. In an extensive experimental evaluation, we applied the framework to category-based object classification in realistic scenarios. We show results obtained by combining the GSH with several different local shape representations, and we demonstrate significant improvements to other state-of-the-art global descriptors.",

We use an inverse depth parametrisation and learn the mapping from image pixel coordinates to the inverse depth of the corresponding scene point given an estimate of the relative camera motion. We show that information about the geometry of the measurements can be integrated into Gaussian Process (GP) models and learnt jointly with the measurements. We provide a novel formulation of the inverse depth and its derivatives and learn their joint distribution. Experimental results are presented using synthesised examples and real monocular images captured from an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV). Results show improvement in depth estimation over standard Gaussian Process Regression (GPR). This improvement is presented by a reduction in the GP depth prediction errors and the predictive variance. Finally, we show mathematically that this improvement is due to the augmented derivative covariance terms and the correlations between the inverse depth and the derivatives.",

In this paper, we present a new integrated approach to identifying and recognizing actions in human movement sequences and their reproduction in unknown situations. We propose a set of task-space features to construct probabilistic models of action classes. Based on this representation, we suggest a combined segmentation and classification algorithm which processes data non-greedily using an incremental lookahead to reliably locate transitions between actions. In a programming by demonstration scenario, our action models afford the generalization and reproduction of learned movements to previously unseen situations. To evaluate the performance of our approach, we consider typical manipulation tasks in a table top setting. In a sequence of human demonstrations, our approach successfully extracts and recognizes actions from different classes and subsequently generalizes them to unknown situations.",

However, there exist many invisible social rules or social protocols in human society. For example, people usually stand in a line to access certain services. It seems that there is a social force or a \u201cspatial effect\u201d which forces people to perform the behavior of standing in a line. Unfortunately, these spatial effects are usually invisible and immeasurable. It makes social behavior understanding to be a difficult problem. The robot that does not comprehend these spatial effects might harm people or itself. Previous methods of behavior understanding mainly only targeted certain scenarios or environments. This paper follows the framework of SBCM (Spatial Behavior Cognition Model)[3] and extends to feature-based spatial effects. By utilizing feature to represent the spatial effect, it is easier to apply known spatial effects to different environments. This paper also demonstrates that the robot is able to learn and execute some common social behaviors under the proposed method. Several simulations and experiments are conducted to verify the proposed idea in this paper.",

        "abstract": "We consider the synthesis of control policies from temporal logic specifications for robots that interact with multiple dynamic environment agents. Each environment agent is modeled by a Markov chain whereas the robot is modeled by a finite transition system (in the deterministic case) or Markov decision process (in the stochastic case). Existing results in probabilistic verification are adapted to solve the synthesis problem. To partially address the state explosion issue, we propose an incremental approach where only a small subset of environment agents is incorporated in the synthesis procedure initially and more agents are successively added until we hit the constraints on computational resources. Our algorithm runs in an anytime fashion where the probability that the robot satisfies its specification increases as the algorithm progresses.",

The state transition parameters are learned online and modeled as two Poisson processes. As a result, our representation not only encodes the expected occupancy of the cell, but also models the expected dynamics within the cell. The paper also presents a strategy based on recency weighting to learn the model parameters from observations that is able to deal with non-stationary cell dynamics. Moreover, an interpretation of the model parameters with discussion about the convergence rates of the cells is presented. The proposed model is experimentally validated using offline data recorded with a Laser Guided Vehicle (LGV) system running in production use.",

We propose three algorithm components required to utilize the plane features in an online Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) problem: fast plane extraction, frame-to-frame constraint estimation, and plane merging. For the fast plane extraction, we estimate local surface normals and curvatures by a simple spherical model and then segment points using a modified flood fill algorithm. In plane parameter estimation, we suggest a new uncertainty estimation method which is robust against the measurement bias, and also introduce a fast boundary modeling method. We associate the plane features based on both the parameters and the spatial coverage, and estimate the stable constraints by the cost function with a regulation term. Also, our plane merging technique provides a way of generating local maps that are useful for estimating loop closure constraints. We have performed real-world experiments at our lab environment. The results demonstrate the efficiency and robustness of the proposed algorithm.",

However, initially deploying autonomously a wireless sensor robot network in a real environment has not taken the proper attention. This paper presents an autonomous and realistic initial deployment strategy, based on a hierarchical approach, in which exploring agents, denoted as scouts, are autonomously deployed through explicit cooperation with supporting agents, denoted as rangers. To evaluate the initial deployment strategy proposed, experimental results with a team of heterogeneous robots are conducted using modified low-cost platforms previously developed by the authors. Preliminary results show the effectiveness of the method and pave the way for a whole series of possible new approaches.",

This process is reversible and can be strategically used to build fluidic components for innovative soft robots capable of soft locomotion. In this work, we show the potential applications of ER fluids to build valves that simplify design of fluidic based soft robots. We propose the design and development of a composite ER valve, aimed at controlling the flexibility of soft robots bodies by controlling the ER fluid flow. We present how an ad hoc number of such soft components can be embodied in a simple crawling soft robot (Wormbot); in a locomotion mechanism capable of forward motion through rotation; and, in a tendon driven continuum arm. All these embodiments show how simplification of the hydraulic circuits relies on the simple structure of ER valves. Finally, we address preliminary experiments to characterize the behavior of Wormbot in terms of actuation forces.",

One of the reasons is that current tactile displays do not satisfy the stringent performance and design requirements for integration in master haptic devices. This paper presents the integration of a compact, high performance tactile display in a teleoperation setup. In this scenario the tactile display provides tactile feedback while remote objects are being contacted through a soft robotic finger. The display is mounted on a force feedback master device, which controls a manipulator equipped with a force sensor and a soft finger. Force feedback and tactile feedback are combined in a hybrid approach. Force feedback on the master reflects the measured remote interaction forces while tactile feedback is model based. This hybrid feedback method can provide force and tactile information in cases of highly structured teleoperation scenes where tactile sensing is absent or rudimentary while accurate environment models exist. An experiment is presented where users teleoperated the robot finger in a 3D contour following task with and without tactile feedback. Subjects' performances indicate an improvement in teleoperation when both tactile and force feedback are present.",

In addition, as existing solutions to toggle the sensors were found to be insufficient, the development of a hardware module, especially designed for quick toggling and synchronization with the depth stream, is also discussed. The algorithm then is evaluated within the scope of a multi-Kinect object tracking scenario and compared to other scheduling strategies.",

The proposed force estimation approach allows for using microparticles in sensing the interaction forces at hard-to-reach regions to avoid the mechanical and electronic complexities associated with physical force sensors. Based on the velocity of the microparticle and the applied currents at each of the electromagnets of the magnetic system, an interaction force observer is designed to estimate the contact forces between the microparticle and a soft-tissue simulant with different elasticities. Experimentally, a magnetic system is utilized to steer a microparticle towards a soft-tissue simulant to carry out force sensing. The experimental results show that forces in the range of nano-Newton can be estimated without nano-force sensors. The estimated interaction forces due to this contact can be used either in sensing and diagnosis applications, or in the realization of a force control system.",

The map can be used to estimate the reachability of a fixated object and to plan preparatory movements (e.g. bending or rotating the waist) that improve the effectiveness of the subsequent reaching action. Three main concepts make our solution innovative with respect to previous works: the use of a gaze-centered motor representation to describe the robot workspace, the primary role of action in building and representing knowledge (i.e. interactive learning), the realization of autonomous online learning. We evaluate our strategy by learning the workspace of a simulated humanoid robot and we show how this knowledge can be exploited to plan and execute complex actions, like whole-body bimanual reaching.",

We consider persistent autonomous behaviors where a cyclic motion must be executed by the robot. The human operator is in charge of modifying online some geometric properties of the desired path. This is then autonomously processed by the robot in order to produce an actual path guaranteeing: i) tracking feasibility, ii) collision avoidance with obstacles, iii) closeness to the desired path set by the human operator, and iv) proximity to some points of interest. A force feedback is implemented to inform the human operator of the global deformation of the path rather than using the classical mismatch between desired and executed motion commands. Physically-based simulations, with human/hardware-in-the-loop and a quadrotor UAV as robotic platform, demonstrate the feasibility of the method.",

Focused assessment with sonography for trauma (FAST) is important for patients who are sent into shock by internal bleeding. However, the FAST has a low sensitivity, approximately 42.7%, and delays of lifesaving treatment due to internal bleeding being missed have become a serious problem in emergency medical care. This study aims, therefore, to construct an automatic internal bleeding detection robotic system on the basis of ultrasound (US) image processing to improve the sensitivity. Internal bleeding has two key features: it is extracted from low-brightness areas in US images and accumulates between organs. We developed method for extracting low-brightness areas and determining algorithms of organ boundaries by low-brightness set analysis, and we detect internal bleeding by combining these two methods. Experimental results based on clinical US images of internal bleeding between Liver and Kidney showed that proposed algorithms had a sensitivity of 77.8% and specificity of 95.7%.",

To achieve adequate gait tracking performance in a compliant robot is not trivial and cannot be addressed with the traditional control approaches used for stiff robots. To permit the development of effective gait generators which take into account the additional dynamic effects due to intrinsic compliance, an appropriate model which can predict the robot motion dynamics is required. In this work, we propose a model which combines the inverted pendulum model approach with a compliant model (Cartesian) at the level of the COM. Based on this model which permits to predict the motion of the centre of mass (COM) of the compliant robot an Internal Model Control strategy is adopted to improve the gait tracking performance. The derivation of the model is introduced followed by experimental validation which demonstrates the tracking performance achieved by the proposed reduced model. The Internal Model Control is subsequently discussed and validated on the COmpliant huMANoid COMAN using a series of ZMP based walking gaits.",

        "abstract": "Intrinsically elastic robots, which technically implement some key characteristics of the human muskoskeletal system, have become a major research topic in nowadays robotics. These novel devices open up entirely new control approaches. They base on temporary storage of potential energy and its timed transformation into kinetic energy. In legged locomotion, such considerations have been a common tool for unveiling the respective fundamental physical processes. However, in arm control, elasticities were typically considered parasitic. In this video we outline our efforts in exploiting the inherent capabilities of intrinsically elastic robots in order to bring them closer to human performance. Instead of applying purely kinematic learing-by-demonstration approaches, which are certainly suboptimal, we argue for using model based techniques in order to optimally exploit the system dynamics such that highly dynamic motion and manipulation capabilities can be achieved. In particular, the explicit use of elasticities as temporary energy tanks can be fully exploited, if they are modeled adequately as an integral part of the mechanism. We also believe that such approaches can substantially contribute to the understanding of human motion biomechanics.",

        "abstract": "This paper presents the design of the lightweight BioRob manipulator with spring-loaded tendon-driven actuation developed for safe physical human-robot interaction. The safety of the manipulator is analyzed by an analytical worst-case estimation of impact and clamping forces in the absence of collision detection. As intrinsic joint compliance can pose a threat by storing energy, a safety evaluation method is proposed taking the potential energy stored in the elastic actuation into account. The evaluation shows that the robot arm design constrains the worst case clamping forces to only 25 N, while being able to handle loads up to 2 kg, and inherits extremely low impact properties, such as an effective mass of less than 0.4 kg in non near-singular configurations, enabling safe operation even in case of high velocities. The results are validated in simulation and experiments.",

        "abstract": "In this paper, a new iterative learning control method which uses multiple space variables for a musculoskeletal-like arm system is proposed to improve the robustness against noises being included in sensory information. In our previous works, the iterative learning control method for the redundant musculoskeletal arm to acquire a desired endpoint trajectory simultaneous with an adequate internal force was proposed. The controller was designed using only muscle space variables, such as a muscle length and contractile velocity. It is known that the movement of the musculoskeletal system can be expressed in a hierarchical three-layered space which is composed of the muscle space, the joint space and the task space. Thus, the new iterative learning control input is composed of multiple space variables to improve its performance and robustness. Numerical simulations are conducted and their result is evaluated from the viewpoint of the robustness to noises of sensory information. An experiment is performed using a prototype of musculoskeletal-like manipulator, and the practical usefulness of the proposed method is demonstrated through the result.",

        "abstract": "We revisit a recently developed iterative learning algorithm that enables systems to learn from a repeated operation with the goal of achieving high tracking performance of a given trajectory. The learning scheme is based on a coarse dynamics model of the system and uses past measurements to iteratively adapt the feed-forward input signal to the system. The novelty of this work is an identification routine that uses a numerical simulation of the system dynamics to extract the required model information. This allows the learning algorithm to be applied to any dynamic system for which a dynamics simulation is available (including systems with underlying feedback loops). The proposed learning algorithm is applied to a quadrocopter system that is guided by a trajectory-following controller. With the identification routine, we are able to extend our previous learning results to three-dimensional quadrocopter motions and achieve significantly higher tracking accuracy due to the underlying feedback control, which accounts for non-repetitive noise.",

Gaussian mixture models naturally capture nonlinear and non-Gaussian systems, while smoothing algorithms provide ability to update using measurements obtained in the past.

Two methods, Children Collapsing and Parent Splitting, are developed to utilize sigma-points smoother for Gaussian mixture model. An indoor localization problem is used to explore and validate the approach. Performance of these new methods is compared to a baseline sigma-points smoother, in both simulation and experiment, and shows much improvement in overall error compared to the truth.",

The laser pointer beams to the surface, and the camera observes the projected laser spot. The position of the laser spot is computed according to the geometrical relationships of line-plane intersection. The laser spot position is sensitive to slight difference of the end-effector pose due to the extensibility of laser beam. Inaccurate kinematic parameters cause inaccurate calculation of the end-effector pose, and then the laser spot position by the forward estimation is deviated from the one by camera observation. For calibrating the robot kinematics, the optimal solution of kinematic parameters is obtained by minimizing the laser spot position difference between the forward estimation and camera measurement via the nonlinear optimization method. The proposed kinematic calibration system is cost-efficient and flexible for any manipulator. The proposed method is validated by simulation and experiment.",

The optimized design allows to conveniently redistribute mechanical power through different actuators, i.e. peak torque and velocity requirements for each actuator can be modulated, thus promoting a lighter design. A detailed analysis of the resulting mechanism workspace is carried out, including the evaluation of kinematic singularities, in order to verify the adequateness of the design in real-world scenarios. The developed model and optimization results are validated through a numerical analysis and experiments in a mock-up system.",

The method proposed ensures that the path planning is always a globally asymptotically stable system at the target point, considering the motion as a nonlinear autonomous dynamical system. The few parameters the algorithm has can be tuned to get different behaviours of the learning system.

We utilize a dual-LIDAR system - one oriented horizontally, in order to infer vehicle linear and rotational velocity, and one declined to capture a dense view of the surrounds - that allows us to estimate both velocity and position within a prior map. We show how probabilistically modelling the noisy local velocity estimates from the horizontal laser feed, fusing these estimates with data from the declined LIDAR to form a dense 3D swathe and matching this swathe statistically within a map will allow for robust, long-term position estimation. We accommodate estimation errors induced by passing vehicles, pedestrians, ground-strike etc., by learning a positional-dependent sensor model - that is, a sensor-model that varies spatially - and show that learning such a model for LIDAR data allows us to deal gracefully with the complexities of realworld data. We validate the concept over more than 9 kilometres of driven distance in and around the town of Woodstock, Oxfordshire.",

        "abstract": "Supposing a space mission of setting monitoring devices at suitable positions on the moon, we discuss how to apply a casting manipulation to the mission. This paper addresses a mechanism of a casting manipulator system and control method to launch a penetrator to the desired position. First, we discuss launching methods, and focus on a method by using rotation of a boom. We then propose the mechanism that keeps a posture of the penetrator equipped at the tip of the boom constant for the absolute coordinate system during its rotation. This mechanism prevents the wire which connects the penetrator and the robot's base from winding the boom. Analyzing a position error of landing point caused by delay of releasing the penetrator, we propose the motion control of the boom to reduce the error. Finally, we develop the system and verify the effectiveness of the proposed method through experiment.",

        "abstract": "We present a method to locate animals in video based on their reported positions using noisy and biased measurements from a radio frequency identification (RFID) system. The system uses a kernel regression method to learn a mapping from reported X, Y, Z locations in the environment to X, Y pixel locations in video with minimal calibration and training data. Our goal is for this system to facilitate animal behavior research by enabling automatic identification of interactions between animals and then providing the location of the animals in video so that the details of each interaction can be examined more closely by either humans or machines. The primary contribution of this work is achieving efficient and reliable 3D to 2D projective mapping in a non-parametric way while also overcoming challenges that would otherwise affect accuracy. Our system successfully addresses issues regarding noisy positional data, position bias, occlusion of RFID tags, and wide angle lens distortion. We validate the system experimentally indoors as well as in the field and compare the accuracy of our system with the standard camera projection model-based procedure.",

        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "Humans exhibit exceptional skills in using tools and manipulating objects of their environment by skillfully controlling exerted force and arm impedance. One of the basic components of this mechanism is the generation of internal models which associate kinematic variables with applied force. On the other hand, making robots capable of skillfully using tools and adapting their motor behavior to new environmental conditions is rather complex. In the present paper, we investigate learning of force control policies for robotic sculpting given multiple task demonstrations. These policies express the relationship between constrained motions and exerted force and are learned in Cartesian space where the coupling of dynamics between different directions of motion is also taken into account. In addition, a novel algorithm is proposed to generalize these policies to new motion tasks, executed in a sufficiently homogeneous environment, same with that in demonstrations, but in presence of new motion-dependent external forces. To this aim, a differential calculus approach is proposed where not only the mapping from motion to force but also from difference in motion to difference in force is learned to generalize the policies to new contexts. This is achieved by learning apart from a set of policy parameters, some newly introduced quantities, so called weight differentials, which express the rate of change of the policy parameters. The proposed approach is validated in simple real-world sculpting experiments by using a two degrees-of-freedom haptic device.",

Taking inspiration from how young infants learn objects, we establish four principles for object learning. First, early object detection is based on an attention mechanism detecting salient parts in the scene. Second, motion of the object allows more accurate object localization. Next, acquiring multiple observations of the object through manipulation allows a more robust representation of the object. And last, object recognition benefits from a multi-modal representation. Using these principles, we developed a unifying method including visual attention, smooth pursuit of the object, and a multi-view and multi-modal object representation. Our results indicate the effectiveness of this approach and the improvement of the system when multiple observations are acquired from active object manipulation.",

Conventional handcrafted methods were complicated to implement reaching skill. Thus, this paper proposes a method using primitives acquired from human demonstrations to learn collision-free reaching skill. End-effector and joint trajectories of primitives are encoded by Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM). The way to avoid an obstacle for a primitive uses reinforcement learning to adjust the part of its end-effector trajectory near the obstacle by adapting the associative Gaussian parameters. By doing this, the movement pattern of robot reaching is goal-directed, collision-free, and similar to human-like reaching. In this paper, we validated the proposed method on an Staibli TX-40 industrial robot. The results showed that the TX-40 robot was able to perform human-like skillful reaching for an object placed in an untrained location of a table.",

        "abstract": "Future robots need to autonomously acquire motor skills in order to reduce their reliance on human programming. Many motor skill learning methods concentrate on learning a single solution for a given task. However, discarding information about additional solutions during learning unnecessarily limits autonomy. Such favoring of single solutions often requires re-learning of motor skills when the task, the environment or the robot's body changes in a way that renders the learned solution infeasible. Future robots need to be able to adapt to such changes and, ideally, have a large repertoire of movements to cope with such problems. In contrast to current methods, our approach simultaneously learns multiple distinct solutions for the same task, such that a partial degeneration of this solution space does not prevent the successful completion of the task. In this paper, we present a complete framework that is capable of learning different solution strategies for a real robot Tetherball task.",

This paper proposes and validates Iterative Learning Control (ILC) with a PD-type learning function for this class of disturbance as a predictive controller for autonomous excavation. However, parameters of the PD learning function may require different tunings for different excavation conditions, and convergence can be slow when compared to changes in excavation dynamics. In order to improve convergence, a plant inversion learning function is reinterpreted as a disturbance observer in the iteration domain, effectively rendering a disturbance learning controller (DLC). A hydraulic mini-excavator was used to evaluate experimentally the performance of the conventional ILC and the DLC against a robust controller. ILC achieved a desired cut profile with non-monotonic transients and DLC converged faster by learning disturbances directly from command discrepancies.",

        "track": "main",
        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "RGB-D sensor has gained its popularity in the study of object recognition for its low cost as well as its capability to provide synchronized RGB and depth images. Thus, researchers have proposed new methods to extract features from RGB-D data. On the other hand, learning-based feature representation is a promising approach for 2D image classification. By exploiting sparsity in 2D image signals, we can learn image representation instead of using hand-crafted local descriptors like SIFT or HoG. This framework inspired us to learn features from RGB-D data. Our work focuses on two goals. First, we propose a novel Hierarchical Sparse Shape Descriptor (HSSD) to form learning-based representation for 3D shapes. To achieve this, we analyze several 3D feature extraction techniques and propose a unified view of them. Then, we learn hierarchical shape representation with sparse coding, max pooling and local grouping. Second, we investigate whether RGB and depth information should be fused at lower level or higher level. Experimental results show that, first, our HSSD algorithm can learn shape dictionary and provide shape cues in addition to the 2D cues. Using the proposed HSSD algorithm achieves 84% accuracy on a household RGB-D object dataset and outperforms a widely used VFH shape feature by 13%. Second, fusing RGB-D information at lower level does not improve recognition performance.",

        "abstract": "We describe a method for learning planning operators for manipulation tasks from hand-written programs to provide a high-level command interface to a robot manipulator that allows tasks to be specified simply as goals. This is made challenging by the fact that a manipulator is a hybrid system\u2014any model of it consists of discrete variables such as \u201cholding cup\u201d and continuous variables such as the poses of objects and position of the robot. The approach relies on three novel techniques: the action learning from annotated code uses simulation to find PDDL action models corresponding to code fragments. To provide the geometric information needed we use supervised learning to produce a mapping from geometric to symbolic state. The mapping can also be used in reverse to produce a geometric state that makes a set of predicates true, thus allowing desired object positions to be generated during planning. Finally, during execution of the plan we use a partially observable Markov decision problem-based planner to repair the initial plan when unforeseen geometric constraints prevent actions from being executed.",

This algorithm relies upon a representation based on projective geometry that uses a special set of polynomial functions borrowed from the field of Computer Aided Geometric Design (CAGD). So far, it has only been possible to learn a model of the forward kinematics function. In this paper, we show how the KBM algorithm can be modified to learn the robot's equation of motion and, hence, its inverse dynamic model. Results from experiments with a simulated serial robot manipulator are presented that clearly show the advantages of our approach compared to general function approximation methods.",

        "abstract": "We present an approach, based on non-negative matrix factorization, for learning to recognize parallel combinations of initially unknown human motion primitives, associated with ambiguous sets of linguistic labels during training. In the training phase, the learner observes a human producing complex motions which are parallel combinations of initially unknown motion primitives. Each time the human shows a complex motion, he also provides high-level linguistic descriptions, consisting of a set of labels giving the name of the primitives inside the complex motion. From the observation of multimodal combinations of high-level labels with high-dimensional continuous unsegmented values representing complex motions, the learner must later on be able to recognize, through the production of the adequate set of labels, which are the motion primitives in a novel complex motion produced by a human, even if those combinations were never observed during training. We explain how this problem, as well as natural extensions, can be addressed using non-negative matrix factorization. Then, we show in an experiment in which a learner has to recognize the primitive motions of complex human dance choreographies, that this technique allows the system to infer with good performance the combinatorial structure of parallel combinations of unknown primitives.",

Coupling of arm kinematics via the torso joints is modeled by dynamically coupling two networks learning the direct inverse kinematics of both torso-arm chains separately. Dividing the upper body kinematics in two problems significantly reduces the number of samples required for learning. Redundancies of the inverse kinematics are represented by multi-stable dynamics of the associative networks and are resolved dynamically depending on the current system state. The model is exploited for task space tracking in a feedback control framework.",

In this paper, we extend this method to weak and irregular slopes. In the case of slopes, we should consider \u201cslippage\u201d.

        "abstract": "Most of robot applications require robots to interact with environment, objects or even with human, which need to integrate vision and force information. Generally, there are five types of vision-force control: pure position control, pure force control, traded control, shared control and hybrid control. The important questions here are: How to define the most appropriate control mode for every part of different tasks and when the control system should switch from one control mode to the other. In this work an automatic decision system is suggested to define the most appropriate control mode for successive tasks and to choose the optimal structure of vision/force control without human intervention. This research will focus on the operations of library automation as real application for the proposed control system such as shelving, storage and sorting of inaccurately placed objects.",

        "abstract": "Variable stiffness actuators realize highly dynamic systems, whose inherent mechanical compliance can be properly exploited to obtain a robust and energy-efficient behavior. The paper presents a control strategy for variable stiffness actuators with the primarily goal of tracking a limit cycle trajectory and a desired stiffness, which is a function of the output position of the actuator. The proposed controller guarantees that the load, attached at the output of the actuation system, asymptotically tracks the desired cyclic motion and the desired stiffness even in presence of external disturbances. Experimental tests on the rotational variable stiffness actuator vsaUT-II validate the control strategy.",

Next, since there is no published characterization of this particular sensor's performance, a comprehensive set of experiments is described, both general tests and ones specific to the novel problem of scanning a power line conductor to detect where obstructions are present. It is then explained how the LIDAR can be mounted on the LineScout power line robot and what algorithm is used to detect obstacles ahead. Basic results obtained on a full-scale power line mock-up clearly demonstrate the potential of the approach.",

        "abstract": "Due to technological limitations robot actuators are often designed for specific tasks with narrow performance goals, whereas a wide range of output and behaviours is necessary for robots to operate autonomously in uncertain complex environments. We present a design framework that employs dynamic couplings in the form of brakes and clutches to increase the performance and diversity of linear actuators. The couplings are used to switch between a diverse range of discrete modes of operation within a single actuator. We also provide a design solution for miniaturized couplings that use dry friction to produce rapid switching and high braking forces. The couplings are designed so that once engaged or disengaged no extra energy is consumed. We apply the design framework and coupling design to a linear series elastic actuator (SEA) and show that this relatively simple implementation increases the performance and adds new behaviours to the standard design. Through a number of performance tests we are able to show rapid switching between a high and a low impedance output mode; that the actuator's spring can be charged to produce short bursts of high output power; and that the actuator has additional passive and rigid modes that consume no power once activated. Robots using actuators from this design framework would see a vast increase in their behavioural diversity and improvements in their performance not yet possible with conventional actuator design.",

        "abstract": "Versatile gait patterns that depend on the locomo- tion speed, environmental conditions, and animal species are observed in quadrupeds. Locomotor patterns are generated via the interlimb coordination, which is partially controlled by an intraspinal neural network called the \u201ccentral pattern generator\u201d (CPG). However, there is currently no clear understanding of the adaptive interlimb coordination mechanism. We hypothesize that the interlimb coordination should rely more on the \u201cphysical\u201d interaction between leg movements through the body rather than the interlimb neural connection. To understand the coordination mechanism, we developed a simple-structured quadruped robot and proposed an unconventional CPG model that consists of four decoupled oscillators with only local force feedback in each leg. Experimental results show that our CPG model allows the robot to exhibit steady gait patterns, adaptability to changes in body properties, and adaptive gait transition between walking and trotting. Our robot mimics locomotor patterns of real quadrupeds following which it can capture the basic mechanism underlying the adaptive interlimb coordination.",

To this purpose, we introduced a staterecovery mechanism into our beat tracking algorithm, for handling continuous musical stimuli, and applied different multi-channel preprocessing algorithms (e.g., beamforming, ego noise suppression) to enhance noisy auditory signals lively captured in a real environment. We assessed and compared the robustness of our audio beat tracker through a set of experimental setups, under different live acoustic conditions of incremental complexity. These included the presence of continuous musical stimuli, built of a set of concatenated musical pieces; the presence of noises of different natures (e.g., robot motion, speech); and the simultaneous processing of different audio sources on-the-fly, for music and speech. We successfully tackled all these challenging acoustic conditions and improved the beat tracking accuracy and reaction time to music transitions while simultaneously achieving robust automatic speech recognition.",

The nanomanipulation system was constructed under hybrid microscope. The hybrid microscope consists of the optical microscope (OM) and environmental-scanning electron microscope (E-SEM) to realize biological specimen analysis by optical imaging including fluorescent imaging, and nano-scale manipulation by E-SEM imaging. Based on the bio-nano manipulation system, we propose a nanoinjection method by nanoprobe insertion and nanobead embeddedness. The nanoprobe was designed to have four tips to fix single nanobead. It is fabricated by focused ion beam (FIB) process. Its nano-scale size is considered to be important for minimal damage to a biological specimen. In this work, as biological specimen, the Caenorhabditis elegans (C. elegans) was used. It is one of the important model organisms for various diseases analysis. The nanoinjection technique is applied to transport fluorescent materials or specific biological organism into a specific cell for in-vivo experiment of C. elegans. The proposed system is considered to be important as future nano-surgery system for life innovation using model organism.",

These sampling-based methods generate robot configurations (nodes) and then connect them to form a graph (roadmap) containing representative feasible pathways. A key step in PRM roadmap construction involves identifying a set of candidate neighbors for each node. Traditionally, these candidates are chosen to be the k-closest nodes based on a given distance metric. In this paper, we propose a new neighbor selection policy called LocalRand(k,K'), that first computes the K' closest nodes to a specified node and then selects k of those nodes at random. Intuitively, LocalRand attempts to benefit from random sampling while maintaining the higher levels of local planner success inherent to selecting more local neighbors. We provide a methodology for selecting the parameters k and K' . We perform an experimental comparison which shows that for both rigid and articulated robots, LocalRand results in roadmaps that are better connected than the traditional k-closest policy or a purely random neighbor selection policy. The cost required to achieve these results is shown to be comparable to k-closest.",

Let us stress that this localization algorithm do not need to know the linear and the angular velocities which are reconstructed by this algorithm using the kinematic model. In this paper, a sensibility study leads to a new fusion algorithm in the multi landmark case using as a basis our posture differentiation based estimator. Some simulations and experimental results are presented in order to prove the effectiveness of the proposed method compared to the well known EKF method.",

In our previous work we showed how localization maps, represented as regular grids, of such signals can be learned through application of vector field SLAM [1]. In this paper we describe a method that, given such a localization map, finds the pose of a mobile robot from observations of the signals. Our method first generates pose hypotheses by searching the localization map for places that best fit to a measurement taken by the robot. A localization filter using an extended Kalman filter (EKF) then verifies one pose hypothesis by tracking the pose over a short distance. In experiments carried out in a standard test environment equipped with active beacons we obtain an average position accuracy of 10 to 35 cm with a localization success rate of 96 to 99 %. The proposed method enables a robot mapping an environment using vector field SLAM to recover from kidnapping and resume its navigation.",

        "abstract": "We have designed an underwater robot that uses perturbations of an emitted electric field to sense, localize, and map its environment. This system is inspired by weakly electric fish, which emit an electric field to sense objects, localize prey, and communicate. When nearby objects distort the electric field, electroreceptors (fish) or voltage sensors (robot) detect these perturbations. Further analysis of the perturbations can reveal information about the associated target, such as size, shape, and distance. One difficulty with extracting distance-to-target for our robotic electrosense platform is that the measurements are dependent on orientation of the robot with respect to the object. We solve this problem by applying techniques from range-only SLAM, with modifications for some of the ways in which electrosense differs from the sensors typically used. We use two different Bayesian filters to estimate the orientation and position separately. Using this approach, we show that our electrosense robot can accurately localize and orient itself, and improve its estimate of position and orientation using motion.",

As a result, the robot can move in the environment that is difficult to travel by single locomotion mode, maintaining the maximum moving efficiency.",

We propose soft continuum limbs as a new paradigm for robotic locomotion in unstructured environments due to their potential to generate a wide array of locomotion behaviors ranging from walking, trotting, crawling, and propelling to whole arm grasping as a means of negotiating difficult obstacles. A straightforward method to derive the kinematics and dynamics for the proposed quadruped has been demonstrated through numerical simulations. Initial experiments on a prototype continuum quadruped demonstrate the ability to stand up from a flat-belly stance, absorb external disturbances such as maintaining stability after dropping from a height and after being perturbed by a collision, and crawling on flat and cluttered environments. Experiment results provide evidence that locomotion with soft continuum limbs are feasible and usable in unstructured environments for variety of applications.",

Specifically, we use stereo to perform detection of vertical structures which are further filtered based on edge responses. A convolutional neural network was then designed to support the classification of pedestrians using both appearance and stereo disparity-based features. A second convolutional network classifier was trained specifically for the case of long-range detections using appearance only. We further speed up the classifier using a cascade approach and multi-threading. The system was deployed on two robots, one using a high resolution stereo pair with 180 degree fisheye lenses and the other using 80 degree FOV lenses. Results are demonstrated on a large dataset captured in a variety of environments.",

We investigate a generalization of SyCLoP in which the high-level decomposition is defined over a given low-dimensional projected subspace of the state space. We begin with a manually-chosen projection to demonstrate that projections other than the workspace can potentially work well. We then evaluate SyCLoP's performance with random projections and projections determined from linear dimensionality reduction over elements of the state space, for which the results are mixed. As we will see, finding a useful projection is a difficult problem, and we conclude this paper by discussing the merits and drawbacks of various types of projections.",

        "abstract": "For an aerial robot, perceiving and avoiding obstacles are necessary skills to function autonomously in a cluttered unknown environment. In this work, we use a single image captured from the onboard camera as input, produce obstacle classifications, and use them to select an evasive maneuver. We present a Markov Random Field based approach that models the obstacles as a function of visual features and non-local dependencies in neighboring regions of the image. We perform efficient inference using new low-power parallel neuromorphic hardware, where belief propagation updates are done using leaky integrate and fire neurons in parallel, while consuming less than 1 W of power. In outdoor robotic experiments, our algorithm was able to consistently produce clean, accurate obstacle maps which allowed our robot to avoid a wide variety of obstacles, including trees, poles and fences.",

From this viewpoint, we are trying to create new musculoskeletal humanoid which has detailed human imitating structure, such as bi-articular muscle, muscle arrangement, joint structure and so on. In this paper, we address the design of lower thigh. The concepts of the thigh include leg configuration, new knee joint and link, and artificial muscle arrangements, especially knee joint structure imitating human flexible motion. The knee joint has yaw axis DOF and its locking mechanism which is usually simplified in robotics. Finally, we conduct extension, flexion and rotation as basic experiment to confirm the joint characteristics. Also, we conduct rotation experiment in the ground state to confirm the contribution of yaw axis DOF for human-like motion.",

        "abstract": "We present a new scheme of remote addressable magnetic actuation for sub-mm microrobotics which uses the hysteresis characteristics of multiple magnetic materials to achieve advanced state control of many magnetic actuators sharing the same magnetic control inputs. Using this standard approach, remote magnetic actuation of a single magnet has been achieved for untethered motion control with a single magnetic control input. We propose the simultaneous use of multiple magnetic materials with varying hysteresis characteristics to effectively gain multiple control inputs as different applied magnetic field strengths. As a first experimental implementation of this idea, we present a set of three heterogeneous magnetic modules floating on a liquid surface which can be remotely reconfigured by application of a field of varying magnitude. As a second implementation, we present a team of up to six independently actuated walking microrobots made from a composite material whose net magnetic moment can be selectively turned on or off by application of a large magnetic field pulse. We also demonstrate a team of two addressable microrobots performing a task requiring cooperative teamwork. The presented concept providing multiple magnetic control inputs could be applicable in various areas of milli- or microrobotics to address multiple magnetic elements for motion or actuation control.",

We studied the influence of the strength of magnetic fields for controlling the coating thickness of unmagnetized MSPs during the fabrication of sheet-like scaffolds. The experimental relationship between magnetic flux density and the thickness of MSP layer was illustrated. Furthermore we investigated the infiltration capacity of poly(L-lactide-co-\u03b5-caprolactone) (PLCL) which was used as scaffold material on the MSP clusters. 5% and 10% PLCL solutions were employed in the experiments. After polymer casting and removal of the sugar template, spherical pores were generated inside scaffold, the thickness evaluation of a single layer scaffold was carried out and the cytocompatibility experiment of NdFeB powder used in fabrication of MSP was confirmed with human umbilical vein endothelial cells.",

As collision prevention and risk analysis are key challenges for today's intelligent transport systems, sophisticated solutions for a collision-free trajectory generation get indispensable. The presented collision checker is integrated into an optimal control based planning framework that generates minimum jerk trajectories for arbitrary maneuvers. In contrast to common collision checkers, the developed method does not need to discretize the time space, but gives an algebraic solution which covers nearly all situations and has a constant response time. Due to its fast evaluation it is predestined for use in a Monte Carlo simulation respecting the probabilistic nature of real world traffic scenes. An example implementation of the proposed method is applied to simulation scenarios that demonstrates the benefits to comparable approaches. The obtained results have proven the feasibility of our approach to risk analysis of traffic situations.",

A soft task constraint allows an interval of feasible values while favoring a given exact value. Previous work only allows for enforcing an exact value or an interval without a specific preference. Soft task constraints are a useful concept in everyday life. For example when carrying a container of liquid we want to keep it as close to the upright position as possible but want to be able to tilt it slightly in order to avoid obstacles. This paper introduces the necessary algorithms for handling such constraints, including projection methods and useful representations of everyday constraints. Our algorithms are evaluated on a series of simulated benchmark problems and shown to yield significant improvement in constraint satisfaction.",

        "abstract": "Robot manipulator designs are increasingly focused on low cost approaches, especially those envisioned for use in unstructured environments such as households, office spaces and hazardous environments. The cost of angular sensors varies based on the precision offered. For tasks in these environments, millimeter order manipulation errors are unlikely to cause drastic reduction in performance. In this paper, estimates the joint angles of a manipulator using low cost triaxial accelerometers by taking the difference between consecutive acceleration vectors. The accelerometer-based angle is compensated with a uniaxial gyroscope using a complementary filter to give robust measurements. Three compensation strategies are compared: complementary filter, time varying complementary filter, and extended Kalman filter. This sensor setup can also accurately track the joint angle even when the joint axis is parallel to gravity and the accelerometer data does not provide useful information. In order to analyze this strategy, accelerometers and gyroscopes were mounted on one arm of a PR2 robot. The arm was manually moved smoothly through different trajectories in its workspace while the joint angle readings from the on-board optical encoders were compared against the joint angle estimates from the accelerometers and gyroscopes. The low cost angle estimation strategy has a mean error 1.3\u00b0 over the three joints estimated, resulting in mean end effector position errors of 6.1 mm or less. This system provides an effective angular measurement as an alternative to high precision encoders in low cost manipulators and as redundant measurements for safety in other manipulators.",

In this research, the mapping process is extended to multiple robots with a novel occupancy grid map fusion algorithm. Map fusion is achieved by transforming individual maps into the Hough space where they are represented in an abstract form. Properties of the Hough transform are used to find the common regions in the maps, which are then used to calculate the unknown transformation between the maps. Results are shown from tests performed on benchmark data sets and real-world experiments with multiple robotic platforms.",

To validate the model, we conducted social interaction test between a rat-like robot and real, live rats. A rat-like robot called WR-4 capable of generating friendly or neutral behaviors among rats serves as partner to the rats in the interaction. Meanwhile, we performed Principal Component Analysis to specify the mathematical model. The experimental results show that this mathematical model allows quantitative estimation of rat sociality. Likewise, the results reveal that rat sociality can be analyzed and modified in this robot-rat interaction system.",

        "abstract": "Creating robots that can act autonomously in dynamic, unstructured environments is a major challenge. In such environments, learning to recognize and manipulate novel objects is an important capability. A truly autonomous robot acquires knowledge through interaction with its environment without using heuristics or prior information encoding human domain insights. Static images often provide insufficient information for inferring the relevant properties of the objects in a scene. Hence, a robot needs to explore these objects by interacting with them. However, there may be many exploratory actions possible, and a large portion of these actions may be non-informative. To learn quickly and efficiently, a robot must select actions that are expected to have the most informative outcomes. In the proposed bottom-up approach, the robot achieves this goal by quantifying the expected informativeness of its own actions. We use this approach to segment a scene into its constituent objects as a first step in learning the properties and affordances of objects. Evaluations showed that the proposed information-theoretic approach allows a robot to efficiently infer the composite structure of its environment.",

By directly augmenting the instrument with a camera, instead of relying on an additional conventional endoscope, the approach becomes independent from inherent calibration uncertainties of the telemanipulation system, other than the micro camera itself, and from registration of pre- and intra-operative surgical data. We calculate a smooth cut path with corresponding scalpel orientation to guide the user towards the optimal trajectory. Experiments are conducted with passive and active haptic virtual fixtures. During active fixturing the optimal forward velocity is calculated to follow the path. The results indicate an improvement in terms of position accuracy, blade orientation, and forward velocity.",

The capacitance change depends on the body volume of C. elegans. Through the correlation with the capacitance change and the body volume of C. elegans, the body volume of C. elegans is assessed without imaging system. The proposed micro fluidic device was implemented using a PDMS layer and a glass substrate that were bonded together. The PDMS layer had a valve system and pattern rows to filter, culture and test C. elegans. A pair of electrodes is used to measure the capacitance change. In this study, we filtered C. elegans into the same size by filter and one C. elegans was introduced into a chamber row to be cultured and tested. And it was confirmed the correlation between the capacitance change and the body volume of C. elegans. And the proposed micro fluidic device will be applied to observe the effect of chemical or toxicant like heavy metal (Cd) on C. elegans as bioindicator.",

Here we present a computationally light and energy efficient approach (AAC) that combines an anticipatory open-loop controller and a variable gain closed loop controller. The approach is grounded in the theory of stochastic optimal control and feedback linearization. As such it links two important approaches to robot control: (1) the family of Computed Torque Controllers (CTC) that are grounded on feedback linearization and classic feedback control, and (2) a more recent family of controllers that aim at finding approximately optimal trade-offs between task performance and energy consumption. Here we show that AAC controllers are highly energy efficient, when compared to CTC, and exhibit some key properties of human motion.",

Given a searching region where some information about the target is known but uncertain (i.e. location and dynamics), and a searching agent with constrained dynamics, we provide two decision making algorithms that optimizes the agent actions to find the target in a minimum time. The problem is faced as a discrete optimization: the actions and the sensor are discrete, and the target probabilistic model is described over a graph, where each vertex contains the target's location probability information and each edge defines the agent possible actions. We revisit the mathematical model of the optimal search problem and we propose a novel approach to include the time into the decision making by reinterpreting it as a maximum discounted time reward problem. The optimal decision plan for the agent is obtained by solving this non convex discrete problem using the cross entropy method. By performing statistical simulations we show how the target is found in minimum time.",

        "abstract": "The minimum-energy trajectory planning and control algorithm on a straight line with rotation is proposed for battery-powered three-wheeled omni-directional mobile robots (TOMRs). In order to lengthen the operation time of a mobile robot with carried batteries, we have chosen a practical cost function as the energy from the batteries to actuation motors. The optimal control theory using a Hamiltonian function is used to solve the minimum-energy trajectory, which gives the rotational velocity profile in analytic form and the translational velocity profile by numerical method. We also establish search algorithm to find the minimum-energy trajectory. These minimum-energy velocity trajectories are compared to the conventional trapezoidal velocity profiles via simulation to analyze actuation energy consumption, which reveal energy savings up to 4.76 %. Also a trajectory following control system is implemented to validate the actual performance.",

We describe the complete set of tools that enable the execution of complex tasks, and share the lessons learned from testing them in a real user's home. In the context of grasping, we show how the use of autonomous sub-modules improves performance in complex, cluttered environments, and compare the results to those obtained by novice, able-bodied users operating the same system.",

        "abstract": "This paper proposes an algorithm dedicated to off-road mobile robot path tracking at high speed. In order to ensure a high accuracy, a predictive and adaptive approach is developed to face the various perturbations due to this context (mainly the bad grip conditions and the terrain geometry). The control law is based on previous work, and requires the knowledge of sideslip angles, which cannot be directly measured. As a result, an observer based on two levels of modeling (kinematic and dynamic) is proposed to ensure a relevant and fast estimation. If the kinematic part is independent from the terrain geometry, the dynamic model used in this paper requires to take explicitly into account the influence of the terrain geometry on mobile robot dynamic. It is achieved by the introduction of the lateral robot inclination, which is on-line estimated via a Kalman filter and integrated into the dynamical model. The advantages of the proposed contribution to path tracking control are investigated through full-scale experiments achieved at high speed (up to 6m/s) on an uneven and grass field.",

The former approach segments the image into multiple regions, then selects and tracks the most likely road appearance. On the other hand, the latter detects the vanishing point and road boundaries to estimate the shape of the road. Our algorithm operates in urban road settings and requires no training or camera calibration to maximize its adaptability to many environments. We tested our system in 1 indoor and 3 outdoor urban environments using our ground-based robot, Beobot 2.0, for real-time autonomous visual navigation. In 20 trial runs the robot was able to travel autonomously for 98.19% of the total route length of 316.60m.",

While identifying potential areas for in-situ fabrication in the construction sector, the intention is also to build upon innovative man-machine interaction paradigms to deal with the imprecision and tolerances often faced on construction sites. By combining the precision of the machine with the innate cognitive human skills, a simple but effective mobile fabrication system is tested for the building of algorithmically designed structures that would not be possible through conventional manual means. It is believed that this new approach to man-machine collaboration, aimed at a deeper integration of human ability with the strengths of digitally controlled machines, will result in advances in the construction sector, thus opening up new design and application fields for architects and planners.",

However, the effects of nonlinear flow through the pneumatic components limit the bandwidth of actuators, thus restricting their use in a high-performance control system.

In this study, we demonstrate that black-box system identification of actuator dynamics can be effectively combined with nonlinear trajectory optimization and stabilization to accomplish dynamic tasks on underactuated robots.

In this paper, we propose a new type of rolling mobile robot with cylindrical aspect, which performs two contrastive modes of motion due to the geometry of its shape. In the first mode called lateral-side rolling, the robot is statically stable except few degree of freedom, whereas the robot is only dynamically stable in the other mode (called edge-rolling) and has potential of high mobility. In this work, we attempt to control this robot using an eccentric rotor without gyroscope and applying linear or nonlinear control theory.",

The nonlinear dynamic model is driven from the first principles. The model is then linearized to obtain a linear state-space model presentation of thirteenth order. To identify the unknown parameters, the state-space model has been divided into subsystems. The parameters of the individual subsystems can be determined by applying a suitable identification method such as the prediction-error minimization (PEM) method. A sequential quadratic programming technique (SQP) was used to obtain feasible initial values of the parameters to be identified. Finally, the gained model of the UAV has been validated.",

        "abstract": "This paper presents modeling and identification of a serial two-link manipulator considering joint nonlinearities for industrial robot control. In order to achieve the desired performance using model-based control approaches, it is important to obtain relevant models of both kinematics and dynamics including the nonlinear effects. The main nonlinear components which result in trajectory tracking errors of typical multi-axis industrial robot, are joint nonlinearities in each axis and dynamic coupling effects between different axes. A parametric modeling approach is presented to reproduce behaviors of a serial two-link manipulator with joint nonlinearities. Nonlinear stiffness, angular transmission errors, and friction in these two links are directly identified as joint nonlinearities. As a case study, this approach is applied for the serial two-link arm of a typical multi-axis industrial robot, which has low frequency vibration modes and significantly affect to the trajectory performance. Effectiveness of the modeling is verified by comparative studies with numerical simulations and experiments. Finally, a simple 2-degrees-of-freedom controller on the basis of the identified dynamic model has been applied to improve the performance of trajectory tracking and residual vibration suppression.",

We consider in-hand manipulation actions as sequences between canonical grasp types identified in the humans. Our work concerns the generation of this sequence, which should be autonomous and fast enough to be performed on-line. We use a Markov Decision Process (MDP) governing the transitions between grasp types, depending on the object and on the goal grasp. The policy is learnt directly from human behavior, after an initialization using an empirical estimation of the state action probabilities of the MDP. Then, the policy is finely learnt from samples of human in-hand manipulation records. These samples are chosen using active learning, in order to maximize the useful information of every record, and speed up the learning process. For planning, the policy gives the sequence with highest probability of success. We show a serie of realistic human-like grasp transition sequences derived from the proposed method.",

In this paper, the interaction between tissue deformation and friction forces has been discussed. We consider the relative velocity and contact length as the main factors of friction force during tissue deforming. An available friction model has been built for dynamic needle insertion simulation based on Finite Element (FE) framework. A Local Constraint Method (LCM) is proposed to calculate the tissue deformation and apply the friction forces to the tissue frame for avoiding remeshing. In our approach a series of equivalent constraints and forces are generated by decomposing them inside Local Regions (LRs) to nodal points. Simulations based on this method to realize the dynamic needle insertion have been conducted for validation.",

Since this scope embraces \u2018group motion\u2019, which relates only humans, and expands its extent of interactions accounting for various auxiliary instruments such as walking aids or pushcarts, we term this collective motion pattern as \u2018coherent\u2019 motion. Coherence is proposed to be characterized by the distance between the moving parties, the scalar product of their velocities and the scalar product of the velocity vector and the displacement vector. The contribution of this study lies in the formulation of coherence in terms of the listed features through explicit mathematical models. The models are developed in accordance with a large database recorded in an uncontrolled environment involving a total of more than 500 mobile entities. The performance of the proposed models is evaluated qualitatively by comparing them to the empirical data and quantitatively by employing log-likelihoods. Comparison to an earlier work indicates that the proposed models improve the identification of coherence quality significantly well.",

Performance metrics, regarding robot's locomotion speed and energy efficiency were developed. A series of experiments were carried out to compare the performance of the selected gaits under these criteria. The experiments can be observed on the accompanying video. Among selected gaits, lateral rolling has demonstrated to be suitable for every pipe size. The fastest speed v = 46.5cm/s, and the most efficient locomotion, under the metrics proposed here, are also shown.",

        "abstract": "We present a monocular visual navigation methodology for autonomous orchard vehicles. Modern orchards are usually planted with straight and parallel tree rows that form a corridor-like environment. Our task consists of driving a vehicle autonomously along the tree rows. The original contributions of this paper are: 1) a method to recover vehicle rotation independently of translation by modeling the vehicle as a car-like robot driving on a 3D ground surface-the rotation is estimated from monocular images while the translation is measured by a wheel encoder; and 2) a method to fit the 3D points corresponding to the trees into straight lines via an optimization algorithm that minimizes the error variance on the robot lookahead point. Additionally, we use a simple vanishing point detection approach to find the ends of the tree rows. The vanishing point detection is integrated into the system via an extended Kalman filter. The methodology's robustness to environmental changes is validated in more than fifty experiments in research and commercial orchards, six of which are presented and discussed in detail.",

        "abstract": "As mobile robots become better equipped to autonomously navigate in human-populated environments, they need to become able to recognize internal and external factors that may interfere with successful motion execution. Even when these robots are equipped with appropriate obstacle avoidance algorithms, collisions and other forms of motion interference might be inevitable: there may be obstacles in the environment that are invisible to the robot's sensors, or there may be people who could interfere with the robot's motion. We present a Hidden Markov Model-based model for detecting such events in mobile robots that do not include special sensors for specific motion interference. We identify the robot observable sensory data and model the states of the robot. Our algorithm is motivated and implemented on an omnidirectional mobile service robot equipped with a depth-camera. Our experiments show that our algorithm can detect over 90% of motion interference events while avoiding false positive detections.",

Modelling such control uncertainty is difficult due to the complex interaction between the platform and its environment. In this paper, we propose a motion planning approach whereby the outcome of control actions is learned from experience and represented statistically using a Gaussian process regression model. This model is used to construct a control policy for navigation to a goal region in a terrain map built using an on-board RGB-D camera. The terrain includes flat ground, small rocks, and non-traversable rocks. We report the results of 200 simulated and 35 experimental trials that validate the approach and demonstrate the value of considering control uncertainty in maintaining platform safety.",

        "abstract": "Robots executing practical tasks in real environments are often subject to multiple constraints. These constraints include orientation constraints: e.g., keeping a glass of water upright, torque constraints: e.g., not exceeding the torque limits for an arm lifting heavy objects, visibility constraints: e.g., keeping an object in view while moving a robot arm, etc. Rejection sampling, Jacobian projection techniques and optimization-based approaches are just some of the methods that have been used to address such constraints while computing motion plans for robots performing manipulation tasks. In this work, we present an approach to handling certain types of constraints in a manner that significantly increases the efficiency of existing methods. Our approach focuses on the sampling step of a motion planner. We implement this step as the drawing of samples from a set that has been computed in advance instead of the direct sampling of constraints. We show how our approach can be applied to different constraints: orientation constraints on the end-effector of an arm, visibility constraints and dual-arm constraints. We present simulated results to validate our method, comparing it to approaches that use direct sampling of constraints.",

This system, PaDY (in-time Parts/tools Delivery to You robot), delivers parts and tools to a worker by recognizing the worker's behavior in the car production line; thus, improving the efficiency of the work by reducing the worker's physical workload for picking parts and tools. For this purpose, it is necessary to plan the trajectory of the robot before the worker moves to the next location for another assembling task. First a prediction method for the worker's trajectory using a Markov model for a discretized work space into cells is proposed, then motion planning method is proposed using the predicted worker's trajectory and a mixture Gaussian distribution for each area corresponding to each procedure of the work process in the automobile coordinate system. Experimental results illustrate the validity of the proposed motion planning method.",

The swimmer forms when a liquid suspension of ferro-magnetic micro-particles and a non-magnetic bead are exposed to an alternating magnetic field that is oriented perpendicular to the liquid surface. It can be steered by modulating the frequency of the alternating field. We model the swimmer as a unicycle and learn a mapping from frequency to forward speed and turning rate using locally-weighted projection regression. We apply iterative linear quadratic regulation with a receding horizon to track motion primitives that could be used for path following. Hardware experiments validate our approach.",

        "abstract": "Swimming microrobots have the potential to be used in medical applications such as targeted drug delivery. The challenges for navigating microrobots in the human body lie not only in the viscosity of body fluids but also in the existence of different types of fibers and cells such as blood cells or protein strands. This paper investigates artificial bacterial flagella (ABFs), which are helical microrobots actuated by an external magnetic field, in methyl cellulose solutions of different concentrations. It can be shown that the microrobots can be propelled in these gel-like heterogeneous solutions and successful swimming was demonstrated in solutions with a viscosity of more than 20 times that of water. Furthermore, results indicate that the existence of fibers can help ABFs swim more effectively, which agrees with previous experimental results reported for natural bacteria.",

        "abstract": "We describe a new physics engine tailored to model-based control. Multi-joint dynamics are represented in generalized coordinates and computed via recursive algorithms. Contact responses are computed via efficient new algorithms we have developed, based on the modern velocity-stepping approach which avoids the difficulties with spring-dampers. Models are specified using either a high-level C++ API or an intuitive XML file format. A built-in compiler transforms the user model into an optimized data structure used for runtime computation. The engine can compute both forward and inverse dynamics. The latter are well-defined even in the presence of contacts and equality constraints. The model can include tendon wrapping as well as actuator activation states (e.g. pneumatic cylinders or muscles). To facilitate optimal control applications and in particular sampling and finite differencing, the dynamics can be evaluated for different states and controls in parallel. Around 400,000 dynamics evaluations per second are possible on a 12-core machine, for a 3D homanoid with 18 dofs and 6 active contacts. We have already used the engine in a number of control applications. It will soon be made publicly available.",

The proposed algorithm is a hierarchical approach towards constructing a passive coordination strategy which utilizes an existing multiple traveling salesman problem (MTSP) solution methodology in conjunction with the GPRM framework to solve the multi-agent motion planning problem. The proposed algorithm is generalized to tackle multi-agent problems involving heterogeneous agents. The algorithm is used to solve multi-agent motion planning problems involving 2-dimensional (2D) and 3-dimensional(3D) agents in stochastic maps with uncertainty in the motion model. Results indicate that the algorithm successfully solves the problem under uncertainty, and generates a solution having high probability of success. It also demonstrates that the algorithm is scalable in terms of number of start and goal locations, the number of agents and their dynamics.",

A two-step algorithm is implemented, consisting of a configuration estimation refinement step and a full Bundle Adjustment step, where 3D coordinates and robot configuration parameters are estimated optimally and simultaneously. Real-time capability is provided by fast feature matching procedures and a special solver for the sparse Bundle Adjustment problem. Furthermore, stochastically optimal estimates are guaranteed as the robot parameters are directly estimated and a detour via an individual camera pose estimation is spared. Finally, experimental results are presented to confirm the performance speed and accuracy of the proposed approach.",

For decades, most researchers focused on the stability and telepresence of the teleoperation systems.

In fact, these variables may seriously affect the telerobotic operations and system performance even if the system stability and telepresence are both perfectly guaranteed. Thus, this paper investigates the method to online identify these condition variables and then employs them to enhance the telerobotic operations with multiple objectives. The designed method was implemented on a mobile manipulator and the experimental results demonstrated its effectiveness.",

The formation control relies on the leader-follower strategy, with three main pair-wise configurations: column, line and oblique. Furthermore, non-linear attractor dynamics are used to generate basic robotic behaviors (i.e. follow-the-leader and avoid obstacles). The control architecture of each follower integrates a representation of the leader (target) direction, which supports leader detection, selection between multiple leaders (decision) and temporary estimation of leader direction (short-term memory during occlusion and prediction). Formalized as a dynamic neural field, this additional layer is smoothly integrated with the motor movement control system. Experiments conducted in our 3D simulation software, as well as results from the implementation in middle size robotic platforms, show the ability for the team to navigate, whilst keeping formation, through unknown and unstructured environments and is robust against ambiguous and temporarily absent sensory information.",

The goal is to rendezvous in minimum time such that the robots can share resources for performing any global task. We specifically consider a global exploration task executed by two or more robots. Each robot explores the environment simultaneously, for a specified time, then selects potential rendezvous locations, where it expects to find other robots, and visits them. We propose a ranking criterion for selecting the order in which potential rendezvous locations will be visited. This ranking criterion associates a cost for visiting a rendezvous location and gives an expected reward of finding other agents. We evaluate the time taken to rendezvous by varying a set of conditions including: world size, number of robots, starting location of each robot and the presence of sensor noise. We present simulation results to quantify the effect of the aforementioned factors on the rendezvous time.",

        "abstract": "This paper presents a collective foraging algorithm designed to simulate natural selection in a group of swarm robots. The Robotic Darwinian Particle Swarm Optimization (RDPSO) previously proposed is improved using fractional calculus theory and evaluated on real low-cost mobile robots performing a distributed foraging task. This work aims at evaluating this novel exploration strategy, by studying the performance of the algorithm within a population of up to 12 robots, under communication constraints. In order to simulate the maximum allowed communication distance, robots were provided with a list of their teammates' addresses. Experimental results show that only 4 robots are needed to accomplish the proposed mission and, independently on the number of robots, maximum communication distance and fractional coefficient, the optimal solution is achieved in approximately 90% of the experiments.",

In both simulated and real robot experiments, we demonstrate that our method produces optimal solutions for simple problems and exhibits novel emergent behaviors for complex scenarios. Assignment Space takes advantage of the domain structure by splitting the planning up into three stages, effectively reducing the search space size and enabling the planner to produce optimized plans in seconds. Our algorithm finds solutions of comparable quality to complete configuration space search while reducing the computing time to seconds, which allows our approach to be applied in practical scenarios in real-time.",

This work discusses several prediction algorithms applicable to this scenario. Whereas previous approaches typically focus on prediction in the presence of deployed base-stations, we consider the more general problem where all nodes in the network can be mobile. Our new algorithm, Multi-sensor ATTenuation Estimation (MATTE), addresses this problem by leveraging other forms of sensor data in combination with signal-strength measurements to infer the locations of attenuating materials in the robots' environment. We also extend prior tomographic and correlation-based approaches to the multi-robot case, allowing a competitive evaluation. All methods are evaluated on a large corpus of real-world indoor and outdoor environments.",

Furthermore, we integrated motion saliency and as a consequence adaptive predictive gaze control to allow for efficient gazing behavior on the ARMAR-III robot head. To evaluate our approach, we first collected a new data set that incorporates two robotic platforms, three scenarios, and different scene complexities. Second, we introduce measures for the effectiveness of active overt attention mechanisms in terms of saliency cumulation and required head motion. This way, we are able to objectively demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed multicriterial focus of attention selection.",

        "track": "main",
        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "In chaos control, an originally chaotic system is modified so that periodic dynamics arise. One application of this is to use the periodic dynamics of a single chaotic system as walking patterns in legged robots. In our previous work we applied such a controlled chaotic system as a central pattern generator (CPG) to generate different gait patterns of our hexapod robot AMOSII. However, if one or more legs break, its control fails. Specifically, in the scenario presented here, its movement permanently deviates from a desired trajectory. This is in contrast to the movement of real insects as they can compensate for body damages, for instance, by adjusting the remaining legs' frequency. To achieve this for our hexapod robot, we extend the system from one chaotic system serving as a single CPG to multiple chaotic systems, performing as multiple CPGs. Without damage, the chaotic systems synchronize and their dynamics is identical (similar to a single CPG). With damage, they can lose synchronization leading to independent dynamics. In both simulations and real experiments, we can tune the oscillation frequency of every CPG manually so that the controller can indeed compensate for leg damage. In comparison to the trajectory of the robot controlled by only a single CPG, the trajectory produced by multiple chaotic CPG controllers resembles the original trajectory by far better. Thus, multiple chaotic systems that synchronize for normal behavior but can stay desynchronized in other circumstances are an effective way to control complex behaviors where, for instance, different body parts have to do independent movements like after leg damage.",

        "abstract": "This paper presents a new feature based scan matching method for solving 6D localization problem in forested environments. The proposed registration process includes two steps. First, the largest group of approximately parallel tree trunk features is utilized to align successive scans along the five dimensions except z direction. Tree correspondences are established by matching point patterns which are abstracted from the position relationships of trees. The optimal 5D transformation is thus determined based on the axes of two key tree pairs which are selected by evaluating their ability of tree alignment. Second, we assign the ground points of two scans into a grid of cells, and minimize z-direction difference of points in shared cells. The experimental results on data collected in real forested environments have demonstrated the effectiveness of this method.",

        "abstract": "There has been long discussion on whether or not environment sensed forces can be used in wave variables based teleoperation schemes. Indeed, the use of sensed forces together with wave variables is one of the main issues of the wave variables framework. In this paper we show that using sensed forces to encode wave variables is energy inconsistent and can lead to non-passive systems. In particular, the network representation of such systems reveals the actual energy flows due to the delayed communication channel and shows which ports in the system must be taken to encode power variables into wave variables. The approach is validated with experimental results.",

A number of results are given that deal with stability and transparency properties of the tele-rehabilitation system in the case of intrinsically non-passive behaviour of the therapist. In particular, a stabilization scheme for the networked tele-rehabilitation system is proposed which guarantees stability regardless of the specific actions of the therapist.

The system successively completes a 3D model from complex shaped objects by iteratively selecting a NBS based on previously acquired data. For this purpose, new range data is accumulated in-the-loop into a 3D surface (streaming reconstruction) and new continuous scan paths along the estimated surface trend are generated. Further, the space around the object is explored using a probabilistic exploration approach that considers sensor uncertainty. This allows for collision free path planning in order to completely scan unknown objects. For each scan path, the expected information gain is determined and the best path is selected as NBS. The presented NBS approach is tested with a laser striper system, attached to an industrial robot. The results are compared to state-of-the-art next-best-view methods. Our results show promising performance with respect to completeness, quality and scan time.",

        "abstract": "Catadioptric cameras combine conventional cameras and mirrors to create omnidirectional sensors providing 360o panoramic views of a scene. Modeling such cameras has been subject of significant research interest in the computer vision community leading to a deeper understanding of the image properties and also to different models for different types of configurations. Visual servoing applications using catadioptric cameras have essentially been using central cameras and the corresponding unified projection model. So far only in very few cases more general models have been used. In this paper we address the problem of visual servoing using the so-called the radial model. The radial model can be applied to many camera configurations and in particular to non-central catadioptric systems with mirror shapes that are symmetric around the optical axis. In this case we show that the radial model can be used with a non-central catadioptric camera to allow effective image-based visual servoing (IBVS) of a mobile robot. Using this model, which is valid for a large set of catadioptric cameras, new visual features are proposed to control the degrees of freedom of a mobile robot moving on a plane. Several simulation results are provided to validate the effectiveness of such features.",

        "abstract": "This paper considers the requirements for stable control of simple devices that consist of a permanent magnet rigidly attached to a screw operating in soft tissue. Placing these devices in a rotating magnetic field causes the device's permanent magnet to rotate synchronously with the applied field, making the attached screw generate forward propulsion. Although there has been significant research in the area of magnetic screws, this paper describes magnetic phenomena that have not been addressed in prior work, yet will be critical in the design of future steering and control strategies for medical applications. Using a time-averaged model of magnetic torque, we analyze the magnetic torque present when intentionally steering the screw or due to naturally occurring disturbances in the screw's heading. We predict and experimentally demonstrate the existence of magnetic torques that simultaneously act to stabilize and destabilize magnetic screws operating in tissue. We find that there exists an applied field rotation speed, above which screws may become unstable, and we find that the interaction between the stabilizing and destabilizing magnetic torques may cause potentially undesired but predictable behavior while steering.",

We approach the problem by extracting time-to-contact information using optical flow and motion analysis. Our method is based on flow divergence which contains qualitative depth information of the environment. In addition, we presented a flexible robot heading decision making framework that is able to incorporate higher level navigation task on top of obstacle avoiding behaviour. A state-machine based control scheme is utilized for the coordination of the robot's action defined under a behaviour based design. Through virtual simulation and physical experiments, we demonstrated the effectiveness of our non-metric navigation strategy in unknown environment.",

Here, a classic spring-loaded inverted pendulum (SLIP) hopper and an actuated, lossy SLIP (ALSLIP) hopper with a more realistic dynamic model that includes an unsprung mass and a series-elastic actuator are each analyzed under conditions where the desired footholds are predetermined according to a stochastic process. We examine the effect of the length of the horizon on the accuracy of foot placement, and we test the robustness of the approach to model uncertainties. Our simulation results show that a model predictive control (MPC) approach is an effective technique for foothold selection, and that a two-step planning horizon for upcoming terrain is theoretically adequate for practical footstep planning in realistically noisy rough terrain running conditions.",

It is easy to implement and shows successful results. DOB, however, cannot bring nonlinearity of the system into the formulation. To overcome this problem, nonlinear robust internal loop compensator (NRIC) is proposed in this paper. NRIC is attached to a existing controller and improves robustness of the system like DOB. NRIC makes an auxiliary input that compensates the difference between the output from the real plant and that from the nominal model. An auxiliary input is designed in a nonlinear \u210b\u221e optimal control framework and the resulting input is given as a simple PID form. The stability of a real plant is guaranteed if a controller is designed as an exponentially stable one (a sufficient condition). The benefit of NRIC is that it is easy to implement and it effectively brings nonlinearities of the system into the formulation successfully. The performance of NRIC is verified through the simulation and experiments.",

        "abstract": "There are many big challenges for manipulation in ultimate temperature environments. Examples of these are in material sciences and industries. For example, steel industries desire new methods for direct handling of materials in temperature higher than 1000 degree Celsius while material scientists desire new method for handling specimen in helium temperature, where higher-quality analysis can be carried out with very low thermal noises. However, conventional actuators don't work in such environments because of their low thermo-stability and more essential reason of the loss of the magnetic and piezoelectric properties of actuator materials. It us well known that magnetism and piezoelectricity completely disappear in temperature higher than Curie-Point, for example. This report proposes a new working principle of actuators for the uses in very wide temperature range. It is driven by volume change associated with phase transition of working fluid. We propose the principle of this actuator and show the possibilities of the actuator design including the possible selections of temperature-resistant materials and working fluids in various temperatures. In addition, as the first step of this research, we designs the first prototype actuator, working successfully at 180 degree Celsius utilizing liquid-vapor transition of water and the basic experiments results, which shows the great possibility of this actuator.",

        "abstract": "In this paper, we present new approaches for computation of the inverse kinematics and inverse dynamics of the Gough-Stewart platform. The new approach for the inverse kinematics, i.e., the calculation of joints velocity and acceleration, is based on using the projection matrices to directly related the mobile platform velocity and acceleration to active joints velocity and acceleration. The new approach for the inverse dynamics is rather unconventional, in the sense that it is based on implicit computation and the use of constraint forces. Our detailed analysis and comparison demonstrate that our new approach for computation of both inverse kinematics and inverse dynamics achieves a better computational efficiency than previously proposed methods.",

        "abstract": "In this paper we consider the problem of null space minimization in coverage path planning of 3D surfaces for redundant manipulators. Existing coverage solutions only focus on Euclidean cost functions and often return suboptimal paths with respect to the joint space. In the approach described here, we explicitly consider the null space by treating different inverse kinematics solutions as individual nodes in a graph and model the problem as a generalized traveling salesman problem (GTSP). The GTSP is a generalization of the TSP where the nodes of the graph are subdivided into clusters and at least one node in each cluster needs to be visited. We evaluate our approach using a PR2 robot and complex objects. Our results demonstrate that our method outperforms Euclidean coverage algorithms in terms of manipulation effort and completion time.",

At the same time, the correct execution of the task assigned to the end effector is ensured by a disturbance observer. The algorithm does not require joint torque measurements.

The run-time system includes algorithms for goal assignment, path planning and local reciprocal collision avoidance that guarantee smooth, fast and oscillation-free motion.

This ability can improve the accuracy and reliability of localization and mapping, enhance the ability of the robot to interact with its environment, and facilitate applications such as inventory management and theft detection. Rather than viewing this task as a difficult application of object recognition methods from computer vision, this work is in line with a recent trend in the community towards unsupervised object discovery and tracking that exploits the fundamentally temporal nature of the data acquired by a robot. Unlike earlier approaches, which relied heavily upon computationally intensive techniques from mapping and computer vision, our approach combines visual features and RGB-D data in a simple and effective way to segment objects from robot sensory data. We then use a Dirichlet process to cluster and recognize objects. The performance of our approach is demonstrated in several test domains.",

The proposed planner automatically determines the pose of an object stably placed near a user assigned point on an environment surface. The proposed method first constructs a polygon model of the surrounding environment, and then clusters the polygon model of both the environment and the object where each cluster is approximated by a planar region. The placement of the object can be determined by selecting a pair of clusters between the object and the environment. We further impose several conditions to determine the pose of the object placed on the environment. We show that we can determine the position/orientation of the object placed on the environment for several cases such as hanging a mug cup on a bar. The effectiveness of the proposed research is confirmed through several numerical examples.",

        "abstract": "This paper presents a data-driven framework for estimating grasp posture and contact region between hand and object by using clustered lower dimensional grasp features. Our framework extracts features of the grasp posture in order to estimate the contact region. Redundant dimension of the hand posture is removed depending on task, which we regard typical for the object. For this purpose, we used mixture principal component analysis (MPCA). This method enables to estimate clusters that can approximate grasp postures by using lower dimensional features. Estimation results of the contact region was obtained by using clustered lower dimensional features of MPCA and object features. These results show that our clusters by MPCA have stronger correlation with the contact region than clustered lower dimensional features obtained by PCA and k-means. Finally, estimation results of the grasp posture and the contact region for three objects are demonstrated. One of the result was compared with grasp posture synthesized by another method presented in the previous research. This comparison revealed that our framework was able to synthesize human-like natural grasp posture than the previous one.",

        "abstract": "Quad-rotor Micro Aerial Vehicles (MAVs) are used widely in research and increasingly in commercial applications as the cost of these platforms has dropped. The cost of entry, however, is still high in large part due to the time and effort involved in repairing vehicles after crashes while learning about the system design and dynamics. In this paper, we present an omni-directional hovercraft, which has dynamics similar to MAVs and can be used as an educational platform to teach students about the behavior and control of MAV-like platforms with minimal cost and effort. Teaching students about the capabilities and challenges associated with MAVs is critical for educating future engineers and scientists that will develop and use the next generation of MAVs. In addition, the hovercraft provides a safe platform for researchers to test control and coordination algorithms before trying them on higher-cost MAVs.",

        "abstract": "As ordinary dual-axis driving mechanisms in X-Y directions, for example, commercially available X-Y stages with ball screws are familiar. However, such driving mechanisms have two stages, namely both upper and lower linear actuators, the latter of which must generate sufficient thrust to carry large weights, including that of the upper actuator mechanism, which has hampered efforts to achieve suitably fast and smooth driving motion due to the inertial force effect. It is also difficult to achieve a small and slimline driving mechanism with such overlapping two-stage structure. In these ordinary two-stage driving mechanisms, the motion of the X-Y stage can be disturbed by the wires of the upper actuator. In this research, we have considered the abovementioned problems, and propose a new omnidirectional driving gear mechanism that enhances its driving area from the normal X-Y plane to convex and concave curved surfaces respectively, and even various combinations of both. The smoothness of basic omnidirectional motion and effectiveness of the driving method of this proposed omnidirectional driving gear mechanism have been confirmed with several experiments involving our setups.",

In this paper we treat two distinct questions that are of primary interest in this context. First, we elaborate an accurate estimation of the maximum contact force during simplified human/obstacle-robot collisions and how the relation between reflected joint stiffness, link inertia, human/obstacle stiffness, and human/obstacle inertia affect it. Overall, our analysis provides a safety oriented methodology for designing intrinsically elastic joints and clearly defines how its basic mechanical properties influence the overall collision behavior. This can be used for designing safer and more robust robots. Secondly, we provide a closed form solution of reaching maximum link side velocity in minimum time with an intrinsically elastic joint, while keeping the maximum deflection constraint. This gives an analytical tool for determining suitable stiffness and maximum deflection values in order to be able to execute desired optimal excitation trajectories for explosive motions.",

The problem of controlling simultaneously the end-effector position and stiffness exploiting the robot redundancy for the optimization of the robot configuration is considered, and the relation between the manipulator redundancy and the selection of both the joint and end-effector stiffness is discussed. The controller is configured as a cascade system that allows the decoupling of the actuators dynamics from the arm dynamics and the consequent reduction of the order of the manipulator dynamic model. Only the actuator and joint positions are needed by the controller, introducing in this way a significant simplification with respect to previously proposed state feedback techniques. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is verified by simulations of a 3-DOF planar manipulator.",

We are able to show that by combining standard components such as Monte-Carlo localization, KLD sampling, and scan matching, an accuracy of a few millimeters at taught-in reference locations can be achieved. We believe that this is an important analysis for developers of robotic applications in which pose accuracy matters.",

A high-performance low-level torque source allows us to control the robot/environment interaction and to straightforwardly take advantage of many model-based control techniques. In this paper, we define a general 1-DOF framework, using basic physical principles, to show that there exists an intrinsic velocity feedback in the generalized force dynamics, independently of the actuation technology. We illustrate this phenomena using three different systems: a generic spring-mass system, a hydraulic actuator, and an electric motor. This analogy helps to clarify important common aspects regarding torque/force control that can be useful when designing and controlling a robot. We demonstrate, using simulations and experimental data, that it is possible to compensate for the load motion influence and to increase the torque tracking capabilities.",

        "abstract": "This paper addresses a vision-based 3D motion estimation framework for humanoid robots, which copes with human-like walking pattern. A humanoid robot, called Roboray, is designed for dynamic walking control with heel-toe motion like a human. In spite of stability and energy efficiency of the dynamic walking, it accompanies larger swaying motion and more uncertainty in camera movement than the conventional ZMP (Zero Moment Point)-based walking does. The framework effectively uses on-board odometry information from the robot to improve the performance of the visionbased motion estimation. To accomplish this, we propose an onboard odometry filter which fuses kinematic odometry, visual odometry, and raw IMU data. And the odometry filter is combined with vision-based SLAM to provide accurate motion model, so it enhances the SLAM estimates. Experimental results in indoor environment verify that the framework can successfully estimate the pose of Roboray in real-time.",

Instead of using a predefined pose to initialize the human skeleton, we construct a key poses database with depth HOG features as searching indexes. When user enters the camera view, we automatically search the database to get the initial skeleton. Then we use the particle filter to track human upper body parts. At the same time, we feed the tracking joints into the hidden Markov models to on-line spot and recognize the performed action. In order to rectify tracking errors, we apply the action recognition results and reuse our key poses database to reinforce the tracking process. Our contributions of the proposed approach are three-fold. First, our method can recognize human poses and actions at the same time. Second, with the key poses database and action recognition results as the feedback, the tracking process becomes more efficient and accurate. Third, we propose a spotting method based on the gradient of HMM probabilities, which thus enables our method to achieve on-line spotting and recognition. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.",

        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "Visual perception capabilities are still highly unreliable in unconstrained settings, and solutions might not be accurate in all regions of an image. Awareness of the uncertainty of perception is a fundamental requirement for proper high level decision making in a robotic system. Yet, the uncertainty measure is often sacrificed to account for dependencies between object/region classifiers. This is the case of Conditional Random Fields (CRFs), the success of which stems from their ability to infer the most likely world configuration, but they do not directly allow to estimate the uncertainty of the solution. In this paper, we consider the setting of assigning semantic labels to the pixels of an image sequence. Instead of using a CRF, we employ a Perturb-and-MAP Random Field, a recently introduced probabilistic model that allows performing fast approximate sampling from its probability density function. This allows to effectively compute the uncertainty of the solution, indicating the reliability of the most likely labeling in each region of the image. We report results on the CamVid dataset, a standard benchmark for semantic labeling of urban image sequences. In our experiments, we show the benefits of exploiting the uncertainty by putting more computational effort on the regions of the image that are less reliable, and use more efficient techniques for other regions, showing little decrease of performance.",

In pursuit of an autonomous, online and adaptive template learning system in this work, we specifically focus on eliminating the requirement of an offline training session performed in advance to build the essential templates, which represent the ego noise. The idea of discriminating ego noise from all other sound sources in the environment enables the robot to learn the templates online without requiring any prior information. Based on the directionality/diffuseness of the sound sources, the robot can easily decide whether the template should be discarded because it is corrupted by external noises, or it should be inserted into the database because the template consists of pure ego noise only. Furthermore, we aim to update the template database optimally by introducing an additional time-variant forgetting factor parameter, which provides a balance between adaptivity and stability of the learning process automatically. Moreover, we enhanced the single-channel noise estimation system to be compatible with the multi-channel robot audition framework so that ego noise can be eliminated from all signals stemming from multiple sound sources respectively. We demonstrate that the proposed system allows the robot to have the ability of online template learning as well as a high performance of noise estimation and suppression for multiple sound sources.",

Since the HPYLM requires no predefined lexicon, we can make the robot system that learns concepts and words in completely unsupervised manner. The proposed algorithms are implemented on a real robot and tested using real everyday objects to show the validity of the proposed system.",

In practice, obtaining such a model is a challenging task which involves modeling such physical processes as friction, which may not be well understood and difficult to model. This paper proposes an approach for online learning of the inverse dynamics model using Gaussian Process Regression. The Sparse Online Gaussian Process (SOGP) algorithm is modified to allow for incremental updates of the model and hyperparameters. The influence of initialization on the performance of the learning algorithms, based on any a-priori knowledge available, is also investigated. The proposed approach is compared to existing learning and fixed control algorithms and shown to be capable of fast initialization and learning rate.",

Our first contribution is a new recursive kernel, which we have integrated into a sparse Gaussian Process to yield the Spatio-Temporal Online Recursive Kernel Gaussian Process (STORK-GP). This algorithm iteratively learns from time-series, providing both predictions and uncertainty estimates. Experiments on benchmarks demonstrate that our method achieves high accuracies relative to state-of-the-art methods. Second, we contribute an online tactile classifier which uses an array of STORK-GP experts. In contrast to existing work, our classifier is capable of learning new objects as they are presented, improving itself over time. We show that our approach yields results comparable to highly-optimised offline classification methods. Moreover, we conducted experiments with human subjects in a similar online setting with true-label feedback and present the insights gained.",

A major drawback of Zero Moment Point (ZMP) based online walking pattern generation methods is that arbitrary ZMPs cannot be achieved without divergence of the Conter of Mass (CoM). In this paper, we propose a new online walking trajectory generation method that utilizes nondivergence conditions of ZMP-CoM in a successive manner. This method enables changes in the walking direction and speed of a robot and push recovery under an unknown external force in unifie form. Experiments confir walking change of up to 4.05 km/h in the speed and changes in the walking direction with minimum delay and successful push recovery under an implse of 22 Ns.",

Active optical markers are sequentially or simultaneously triggered to achieve a maximum in quantity and quality of measurements available for tracking. Markers that appear in a camera image are identified by individual activation and are locally tracked in the 2D-images after initial identification. The 2D-position measurements of the cameras are combined with low latency measurements of acceleration and angular velocity from an inertial measurement unit. An Extended Kalman Filter is used for an ultra-tightly coupled data fusion, that takes advantage of all marker measurements with verified identity. The accurate, low latency tracking is robust with respect to temporary marker occlusions, as needed in applications where a robot is directly controlled with a tracked device. The tracking algorithms are implemented in real-time and verified with a test bed in a medical robotics context.",

This paper proposes a new methodology named \u201ckey joint method\u201d for reducing the energy cost by adjusting an internal stress inside a closed chain. Firstly, we analyze the internal stress theoretically taking the degrees of freedom (DOF) and the number of position actuated joints into consideration, then a practical key joint method is proposed by changing a suitable redundant position controlled joint to be force control. After that, a parametric family is introduced for representing various of possible motions subjected to the robot dynamics and other constraints. Finally, a general optimization method is proposed for planning an energetically efficient multi-contact robot motion taking the motion trajectories and internal stress into consideration. As an example, the pace gait ladder decent motion is taken to explain the principle and realization of the proposed method. As experimental evaluation shows, the key joint method is effective for reducing the energy cost in the multi-contact motion.",

The stage is featured with nanoscale positioning precision, high bandwidth, long scanning range and fully decoupled structure, which can be selected to work in dual working modes. Based upon the matrix method, the discussions in terms of output compliance, input stiffness and dynamics modeling via Lagrange equation have been performed in detail. Moreover, a series of optimal designs have been implemented using Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) algorithm. The results of the finite-element analysis (FEA) indicate that the first natural frequency is approximated 583 Hz, the amplification ratio in two axes is about 4, thus the maximum scanning range can reach up to around 341 \u03bcm \u00d7 341 \u03bcm without material failure, while the cross-coupling between the two axes is kept within 2%. All the results indicate that the presented mechanism possesses a good performance for high-rate AFM scanning.",

        "abstract": "This paper presents a framework to generate dynamic walking for biped robots. A set of self-stable gait primitives is first constructed. It is done by 1) representing parametric gait primitives, 2) utilizing state-dependent torque control, and 3) doing numerical optimization that takes into account the complex multi-body dynamics with frictional contact forces. Dynamic walking to follow the arbitrary path including a curve is then generated online via sequentially composing primitive motions. Results show that dynamic gaits are humanlike and efficient compared to the conventional knee bent walkers. Our proposed method is applied to a torque-controlled, human-sized biped robot platform, \u2018Roboray\u2019 which is cable-driven partially for joint compliance. Following a discussion on robot design and control, experimental results are also reported.",

        "abstract": "Anthropomorphic robots that aim to approach human performance agility and efficiency are typically highly redundant not only in their kinematics but also in actuation. Variable-impedance actuators, used to drive many of these devices, are capable of modulating torque and passive impedance (stiffness and/or damping) simultaneously and independently. Here, we propose a framework for simultaneous optimisation of torque and impedance (stiffness) profiles in order to optimise task performance, tuned to the complex hardware and incorporating real-world constraints. Simulation and hardware experiments validate the viability of this approach to complex, state dependent constraints and demonstrate task performance benefits of optimal temporal impedance modulation.",

To achieve the OBiS, we perform the concurrent microvascular anastomosis by using suction-induced vascular fixation (SVF) method for easily connection to artificial tubes with blood vessels led to the explanted chick's heart. Through the experiment with a simulated cardiovascular, it is confirmed that vessels can be aligned by using the proposed method. In addition, we have succeeded in connecting the Alg tubes with the blood vessels led to the heart of chick embryo. OBiS is available for the evaluation of new drugs immune response not only without using large animals but also as a response of organs beyond cellular level.",

        "abstract": "Sensorless part orienting has proven useful in manufacturing and automation, while the manipulation of deformable objects is an area of growing interest. Existing sensorless orienting techniques may produce forces which have the potential to damage deformable parts. We present an algorithm that, when provided a geometric description of the part and a deformation model, generates a plan to orient the part up to symmetry from any initial orientation. The solution exploits deformation of the object under certain configurations to help resolve ambiguity. The approach has several attractive features: (1) the resulting plan is a short sequence of such actions guaranteed to succeed for all initial configurations; (2) the algorithm operates even with a very simple model of deformation, but is extensible when specialized knowledge is available; (3) failure to find a feasible solution has precise semantics (e.g., inadequate manipulator precision). We validate the algorithm experimentally with a pair of low-precision robot manipulators, orienting 6 parts made of 4 types of materials, with the correct orientation being reached on 80% of the 192 trials. Careful analysis of the failures emphasizes the importance of low-friction conditions, that increased manipulator precision would be beneficial but is not necessary, and a simple deformation model can suffice. In addition to illustrating the feasibility of sensorless manipulation of deformable parts, we note that the algorithm has applications to manipulation of non-deformable parts without the pressure switch sensor employed in existing sensorless orienting strategies.",

        "abstract": "This paper addresses auditory scene analysis, especially, sound source localization using an aerial vehicle with a microphone array in an outdoor environment. Since such a vehicle is able to search sound sources quickly and widely, it is useful to detect outdoor sound sources, for instance, to find distressed people in a disaster situation. In such an environment, noise is quite loud and dynamically-changing, and conventional microphone array techniques studied in the field of indoor robot audition are of less use. We, thus, proposed MUltiple SIgnal Classification based on incremental Generalized EigenValue Decomposition (iGEVD-MUSIC). It can deal with high power noise by introducing a noise correlation matrix and GEVD even when the signal-to-noise ratio is less than 0 dB. In addition, the noise correlation matrix is incrementally estimated to adapt to dynamic changes in noise. We developed a prototype system for auditory scene analysis based on the proposed method using the Parrot AR.Drone with a microphone array and a Kinect device. Experimental results using the prototype system showed that dynamically-changing noise is properly suppressed with the proposed method and multiple human voice sources are able to be localized even when the AR.Drone is moving in an outdoor environment.",

        "abstract": "Rigid object manipulation with robots has mainly relied on precise, expensive models and deterministic sequences. Given the great complexity of accurately modeling deformable objects, their manipulation seems to call for a rather different approach. This paper proposes a probabilistic planner, based on a Partially Observable Markov Decision Process (POMDP), targeted at reducing the inherent uncertainty of deformable object sorting. It is shown that a small set of unreliable actions and inaccurate perceptions suffices to accomplish the task, provided faithful statistics on both of them are collected beforehand. The planner has been applied to a clothes sorting task in a real case context with a depth and color sensor and a robotic arm. Experimental results show the promise of the approach since more than 95% certainty of having isolated a piece of clothing is reached in an average of four steps for quite entangled initial clothing configurations.",

Whole body skin systems for humanoid robots are considered a fundamental feature to improve contact interaction tasks by means of large scale tactile feedback. Stemming from previous work [1], the article describes how it is possible to extend the Parallel Force-Position control paradigm with the use of tactile maps, i.e., computational representation structures encoding the position of tactile elements located on the robot body surface. Furthermore, tactile maps are used to encode specific local features of contact trajectories, such as the desired exerted force at the contact point and the desired velocity. Results in simulation validate the approach.",

        "abstract": "We present PRRT (Parallel RRT) and PRRT* (Parallel RRT*), sampling-based methods for feasible and optimal motion planning that are tailored to execute on modern multi-core CPUs. Our algorithmic improvements enable PRRT and PRRT* to achieve a superlinear speedup: when p processor cores are used instead of 1 processor core, computation time is sped up by a factor greater than p. To achieve this superlinear speedup, our algorithms utilize three key features: (1) lock-free parallelism using atomic operations to eliminate slowdowns caused by lock overhead and contention, (2) partition-based sampling to reduce the size of each processor core's working data set to improve cache efficiency, and (3) parallel backtracking to reduce the number of rewiring steps performed in PRRT*. Our parallel algorithms retain the ability to integrate with existing CPU-based libraries and algorithms. We demonstrate fast performance and superlinear speedups in two scenarios: (1) a holonomic disc-shaped robot moving in a planar environment and (2) an Aldebaran Nao small humanoid robot performing a 2-handed manipulation task using 10 DOF.",

        "abstract": "Legged locomotion involves periodic negative and positive work, which usually results in high power consumption. Improvement of the energy efficiency is possible by using energy storage elements to reversibly store the negative work performed during a walking or running cycle. While series elastics with high impedance (high gear ratio) actuators are widely used, we investigate the application of parallel stiffness with highly backdriveable actuators. We specifically show that the use of parallel springs in a bounding quadruped with a flexible spine can lower power consumption by over 50%.",

A reduced-order passive and conservative model with a segmented flexible torso and compliant legs is introduced to study torso-leg coordination. Numerical return map studies reveal that a large variety of cyclic bounding motions can be realized passively, as a natural mode of the system. Despite the simplicity of the model, the resulting motions correspond to torso bending movements that resemble those in galloping mammals without explicit reliance on the fine structural and morphological details. This way, the proposed model offers a unifying description of the task-level locomotion behavior, and can be used to inform feedback control synthesis by serving as a behavioral target for the control system.",

        "abstract": "This paper describes a theory and experimental results concerning a passive aerial acrobat robot without electric power. As the robot performs hand-to-hand on its flying trapeze, it utilizes no electricity but simply draws power from the mechanical potential energy of its swings. The robot, holding onto the trapeze, overcomes the rotation moment by aid of a counterbalance that is on the opposite side of the swing and the robot begins to move. As the counterbalance is set on the frame of the swing at offsetting distance, a large rotation moment is generated, even when the robot gets to the most inferior point. As the result, the robot rises at an accelerated rate through the bottom point. When the robot reaches up to the height of the next swing, the hand of the robot slips from the handrail and the robot is released from the swing. At that time, the robot's arms bend forward by a spring installed inside the body of the robot, and the robot can catch hold of the handrail of the next swing. It was confirmed that the robot was able to transfer continuously throughout a set of the swings. It looks strange that the robot goes upward against the gravitational force and finally makes 90-degree turn to get to the goal.",

The approach needs no prior information about RFID sensor models, the distribution and positioning of the tags nor does it require a map of the environment. Particularly, it is adaptive to different reader power levels and various tag densities, which have a major impact on RFID performance.

In particular herein considered a two-variable RD model provides advantages of natural parallelism, noise resistance, and especially the non-annihilating feature that traveling fronts separating two stable states exhibit upon a collision. Based on this, we developed a path planning algorithm that provides paths with lengths competitive to standard path planning approaches. Moreover, the results presented indicates the paths are smoother and also within a safe distance from obstacles; thus, the found paths combine advantages of two fundamental approaches, namely the DT algorithm and Voronoi diagram.",

Based on the deformable characteristic of the clothes, the tension force of clothes is analyzed and the model of tension degree is established. A clothes climbing robot called Clothbot is composed of a two-wheeled gripper and a 2 Degrees of Freedom (DOF) tail. Based on the locomotion of this robot, the weights of tension degree and the locomotion characteristic are added into the A* algorithm. Combined with the two weights applied, the optimal path to the target for the Clothbot is obtained. The Clothbot has been developed to evaluate the algorithm. The simulation and the experiments have verified the feasibility of this method. In addition, The error state of the movement of the robot which is called side tumbling has been corrected by the motion of the 2-DOF tail.",

        "abstract": "We address the problem of incorporating path planning with image-based control of a wheeled mobile manipulator (WMM) performing visually-guided tasks in complex environments. The WMM consists of a wheeled (non-holonomic) mobile platform and an on-board robotic arm equipped with a camera mounted at its end-effector. The visually-guided task is to move the WMM from an initial to a desired location while respecting image and physical constraints. We propose a kinodynamic planning approach that explores the camera state space for permissible trajectories by iteratively extending a search tree in this space and simultaneously tracking these trajectories in the WMM configuration space. We utilize weighted pseudo-inverse Jacobian solutions combined with a null space optimization technique to effectively coordinate the motion of the mobile platform and the arm. We also present the preliminary results obtained by executing the planned trajectories on a real WMM system via a decoupled control scheme where the on-board arm is servo controlled along the planned feature trajectories while the mobile platform is simultaneously controlled along its trajectory using a state feedback tracking method.",

This paper shows how to incorporate a subclass of LTL, namely co-safe LTL, into Probabilistic RoadMap (PRM) path planners. PRMs provide an important class of approaches which have been shown to work well for high-dimensional configuration spaces. The proposed Temporal-PRM approach combines the roadmap with a finite automaton representing the co-safe LTL formula \u03c6 and conducts the search over the combined graph. As a result, roadmap connections are reused when needed to find paths that satisfy \u03c6. Experimental validation is provided in simulation by using different scenes, co-safe LTL specifications, a snake-like robot model with numerous degrees-of-freedom, and different sampling strategies.",

While human drivers and onboard sensors are able to detect obstacles and pedestrians within line-of-sight, in complex environments initially occluded or obscured dynamic objects can unpre dictably enter the path of a vehicle. We propose a safety system which integrates a vision-based offboard pedestrian tracking subsystem with an onboard localisation and navigation subsystem. This combination enables warnings to be communicated and effectively extends the vehicle controllers field of view to include areas that would otherwise be blind spots. A simple flashing light interface in the vehicle cabin provides a clear and intuitive interface to alert drivers of potential collisions. We implemented and tested the proposed solution on an automated industrial vehicle to verify the applicability for both human drivers and under autonomous operation.",

This paper demonstrates the role of visual development triggered by self-organization in a learner's visual space in a case of the mirror neuron system (MNS). A robot learns a function of the MNS by associating self-induced motor commands with observed motions while the observed motions are gradually self-organized in the visual space. A temporal convergence of the self-organization triggers visual development, which improves spatiotemporal blur filters for the robot's vision and thus further advances self-organization in the visual space. Experimental results show that the self-triggered development enables the robot to adaptively change the speed of the development (i.e., slower in the early stage and faster in the later stage) and thus to acquire clearer correspondence between self and other (i.e., the MNS).",

For this reason the nonlinear dynamics of lateral tire forces must be taken into account into the design of steering controllers for autonomous vehicles. This paper presents the design of a state feedback piecewise affine controller applied to an UGV to coordinate the steering and torque distribution inputs in order to reduce vehicle skidding on demanding maneuvers. The control synthesis consists in solving an optimization procedure involving constraints in the form of Linear Matrix Inequalities which are obtained from stability conditions of a piecewise quadratic Lyapunov function.

This motion simulator provides a wearer with physical supports to move their lower extremities or physical constrains as well as floor reactive force on bottoms of their feet during gait-like motion in an MRI room so that brain activities could be simultaneously measured. An MRI is one of the most powerful tools to measure activities in any part of brain but a device attached on a subject is limited because the material used for the device should be nonmagnetic. This paper shows the compatibility of the motion simulator that consists of Mckibben-type pneumatic artificial muscles and nonmagnetic materials. Also this paper shows the performance of the floor-reactive-force generator mounted on the soles of the motion simulator.",

        "abstract": "This paper introduces contribution of the thumb sensation to precisions of human's pinching force control when the human cooperatively pinch an object with the exoskeleton, which augments human pinching force based on a surface electromyography. A human hand should contact with a grasping object directly, while the exoskeleton pushes the human hand for grasping support, because tactile feedback from the hand is very important for human to handle an object stably and dexterously. However the exoskeleton may crush the human fingers with excessive force. The exoskeleton distributes the assistive force to the pinching object in two routes: directly and through a human finger. In our previous study, the accuracy of the pinching force is improved when the distribution factor of the index finger assistance keeps constant. This paper reports improvement of the pinching force when the fixed ratio of the pinching force assistance is applied to the index finger and thumb. In addition, we reveal the contribution of the thumb sensation.",

        "abstract": "There has been considerable interest recently in building 3D maps of environments using inexpensive depth cameras like the Microsoft Kinect sensor. We exploit the fact that typical indoor scenes have an abundance of planar features by modeling environments as sets of plane polygons. To this end, we build upon the Fast Sampling Plane Filtering (FSPF) algorithm that extracts points belonging to local neighborhoods of planes from depth images, even in the presence of clutter. We introduce an algorithm that uses the FSPF-generated plane filtered point clouds to generate convex polygons from individual observed depth images. We then contribute an approach of merging these detected polygons across successive frames while accounting for a complete history of observed plane filtered points without explicitly maintaining a list of all observed points. The FSPF and polygon merging algorithms run in real time at full camera frame rates with low CPU requirements: in a real world indoor environment scene, the FSPF and polygon merging algorithms take 2.5 ms on average to process a single 640 \u00d7 480 depth image. We provide experimental results demonstrating the computational efficiency of the algorithm and the accuracy of the detected plane polygons by comparing with ground truth.",

Developing a new algorithm for planar segmentation has been motivated by the results from other state of art methods which are tailored to segment depth images generated from Time of Flight cameras or structure light cameras but failed to segment depth images generated from stereo camera of normal textured objects. Unlike other state of Art methods which mainly use local surface normals for planar segmentation; a new Gradient of Depth (GoD) feature is proposed. The proposed GoD feature is parameter-free, easy to compute in terms of complexity and faster to compute compared to the local surface normals. The proposed GoD feature is implemented in a robust algorithm which uses the advantage of the 1D dimension feature space of the GoD feature and meets the performance of state of art algorithms in terms of quality segmentation. Moreover the proposed algorithm is able to segment planar regions from nonplanar objects and it is robust to parameter changes which allows to be used on different scenes generated using different cameras.",

Paths that guarantee stability while at the same time maximise the height of the sensor payload, thereby enhancing the capacity of the robot to explore the environment are obtained using a search algorithm based on A*. This is particularly applicable to operations such as search and rescue where observing the environment for locating victims is the major objective, although the proposed technique can be generalised to incorporate other potentially conflicting objectives such as minimising energy. The proposed planning strategy looks at exploiting the (possibly incomplete) environment information available to the robot and/or operator as it explores novel terrain. The effectiveness of the approach is evaluated using data obtained from a multi-tracked robot fitted with a manipulator arm and a range camera in a mock-up search and rescue arena.",

The main contributions of this paper are: (1) It derives analytical functions depicting the evolution of the vehicle on uneven terrain. These functional descriptions enable us to have a fast evaluation of possible vehicle stability along various directions on the terrain and this information is used to control the shape of the trajectory. (2) It introduces a novel paradigm wherein non-linear time scaling brought about by parametrized exponential functions are used to modify the velocity and acceleration profile of the vehicle so that these satisfy the no-slip and contact constraints. We show that nonlinear time scaling manipulates velocity and acceleration profile in a versatile manner and consequently has exceptional utility not only in uneven terrain navigation but also in general in any problem where it is required to change the velocity of the robot while keeping the path unchanged like collision avoidance.",

The proposed system currently consists of ten play modules, including a chatbot with eye contact, card playing, and drawing. The algorithms of these modules are briefly discussed in this paper. To sustain the player's interest in the system, we also propose an action-selection strategy based on a transition model of the child's mental state. The robot can estimate the child's state and select an appropriate action in the course of play.

During walking on rough terrain and planning its motion the robot has to determine the horizontal position, distance to the ground, and inclination of the platform. The proposed posture optimization algorithm is based on the Particle Swarm Optimization method. The algorithm increases the stability margin and maximizes the possible motion range of the robot (by maximizing the kinematic margin of each leg). The computation of the kinematic margin is performed by using an analytical function obtained with the Gaussian approximation. The Gaussian-based approximation significantly decreases the time consumed by the algorithm and allows to implement the posture optimization procedure on the real robot. The posture optimization is used as a part of the RRT-based motion planer to find a full-body path while climbing the obstacles.",

        "abstract": "We introduce a framework to predict the landing behaviour of a Micro Air Vehicle (MAV) from the appearance of the landing surface. We approach this problem by learning a mapping from visual texture observed from an onboard camera to the landing behaviour on a set of sample materials. In this case we exemplify our framework by predicting the yaw angle of the MAV after landing. Our framework demonstrates the applicability of established texture classification methods usually tested on stationary camera setups for the more challenging case of textures observed from a MAV. Results for supervised training demonstrate good estimation of the landing behaviour and motivate future work to implement autonomous decision making strategies and other behaviour predictions based on imagery.",

        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "Highly accurate positioning is fundamental to the performance of vitreoretinal microsurgery. Of vitreoretinal procedures, membrane peeling is among the most prone to complications since extremely delicate manipulation of retinal tissue is required. Associated tool-to-tissue interaction forces are usually below the threshold of human perception, and the surgical tools are moved very slowly, within the 0.1-0.5 mm/s range. During the procedure, unintentional tool motion and excessive forces can easily give rise to vision loss or irreversible damage to the retina. A successful surgery includes two key features: controlled tremor-free tool motion and control of applied force. In this study, we present the potential benefits of a micro-force sensing robot in vitreoretinal surgery. Our main contribution is implementing fiber Bragg grating based force sensing in an active tremor canceling handheld micromanipulator, known as Micron, to measure tool-to-tissue interaction forces in real time. Implemented auditory sensory substitution assists in reducing and limiting forces. In order to test the functionality and performance, the force sensing Micron was evaluated in peeling experiments with adhesive bandages and with the inner shell membrane from chicken eggs. Our findings show that the combination of active tremor canceling together with auditory sensory substitution is the most promising aid that keeps peeling forces below 7 mN with a significant reduction in 2-20 Hz oscillations.",

        "abstract": "Previous surface shape presenting methods had difficulties in generating high-density tactile information owing to blurriness in tactile images caused by lateral skin deformations. In this study, a new surface shape presenting method is proposed, and it employs overlapping small-amplitude vibrations instead of a single vibration. This method represents the mechanism of stationary boundary contacts (SBCs), a vibrotactile sensitivity enhancement method proposed in a previous research. A series of psychophysical experiments showed that the vibrations overlapping method can significantly enhance the human vibrotactile sensitivity and lead to the production of sharp tactile images. Moreover, the stimuli intensity can be controlled not only by changing the vibration amplitudes but also by changing the phase deviations between vibrations; this enables the presentation of various surface shape patterns that cannot be presented by using the previous SBC method alone.",

        "abstract": "We present an efficient method for motion control of redundant robots performing multiple prioritized tasks in the presence of hard bounds on joint range, velocity, and acceleration/ torque. This is an extension of our recently proposed SNS (Saturation in the Null Space) algorithm developed for single tasks. The method is defined at the level of acceleration commands and proceeds by successively discarding one at a time the commands that would exceed their bounds for a task of given priority, and reintroducing them at their saturated levels by projection in the null space of a suitable Jacobian associated to the already considered tasks. When processing all tasks in their priority order, a correct preemptive strategy is realized in this way, i.e., a task of higher priority uses in the best way the feasible robot capabilities it needs, while lower priority tasks are accommodated with the residual capability and do not interfere with the execution of higher priority tasks. The algorithm automatically integrates a multi-task least possible scaling strategy, when some ordered set of original tasks is found to be unfeasible. Simulation and experimental results on a 7-dof lightweight KUKA LWR IV robot illustrate the good performance of the method.",

User study results show that the readability of the approach behavior is improved by including parameters such as path execution speed, distance between goal pose and person, position and orientation in front of the person, and trajectory shape. The video depicts the results of an implemented human approach planner for dynamic environments. It plans a trajectory towards a person applying the named set of social constraints. Simulations and real world experiments show how the approaching behavior smoothly brings the robot close to a person for interaction.",

        "abstract": "For effective collaboration between two humans, they are required to adapt to each other according to their apparent behavior in time. Similarly for intuitive human-robot collaboration the robot is required to adapt to the human intention apparent from his behavior. In this paper, we introduce a probability-based approach that helps the robot to adapt to the human behavior and to act proactively in the ambiguous human intentions scenarios. The robot can either wait for disambiguation of the intention, requiring extra human actions or it can proactively act depending on his previous knowledge about the human behavior. The adaptive proactivity is achieved by the help of transition weights for transitions between the neighbouring states in a finite state machine. A finite state machine models the human intention. We also introduce the online update of the intention triggers for the intentions. The online intention trigger update corresponds to the online selection of the specific state of a finite state machine as the end state. The online update of the intention triggers makes the robot more proactive in the direction of premature intention estimation. Thus the transition weights and premature intention estimation makes the human-robot collaboration more intuitive.",

We explain how we obtain 3D landmark measurements and derive a Gaussian noise model for these measurements. We then argue that the classic way of removing outliers from stereo image features, by estimating fundamental matrices, has limitations. We propose instead the use of a probabilistic measure in determining consensus sets of hypotheses generated in a RANSAC framework. In order to test the performance of this approach we incorporate it into an EKF SLAM system, which is notorious for its sensitivity to landmark mismatches. We measure the accuracy achieved on outdoor datasets, using DGPS as ground truth, and compare it to two other standard SLAM algorithms. We find that the proposed system outperforms the others significantly.",

        "abstract": "We address the problem of controlling a stochastic version of a Dubins vehicle such that the probability of satisfying a temporal logic specification over a set of properties at the regions in a partitioned environment is maximized. We assume that the vehicle can determine its precise initial position in a known map of the environment. However, inspired by practical limitations, we assume that the vehicle is equipped with noisy actuators and, during its motion in the environment, it can only measure its angular velocity using a limited accuracy gyroscope. Through quantization and discretization, we construct a finite approximation for the motion of the vehicle in the form of a Markov Decision Process (MDP). We allow for task specifications given as temporal logic statements over the environmental properties, and use tools in Probabilistic Computation Tree Logic (PCTL) to generate an MDP control policy that maximizes the probability of satisfaction. We translate this policy to a vehicle feedback control strategy and show that the probability that the vehicle satisfies the specification in the original environment is bounded from below by the maximum probability of satisfying the specification on the MDP.",

For the experiments, a situation is created in which the sharp end-effector tip of a robot suddenly approaches the eyes of a facing participant. The avoidance reaction time is defined as the time interval from the beginning of the end-effector motion to when the participant begins movement to avoid harm. The results suggest that the avoidance reaction time does not depend on the type of work being performed but on the initial distance between the human's eyes and the approaching object. Using this information, safe human-robot working distances can be determined.",

        "abstract": "We present a rapid-manufacturable, hair-actuated contact sensor array designed for use on legged millirobots. The sensor is an array of sensitive contact switches. Each switch is activated by loading a hair mounted at the switch tip. The hair sensor array is sufficiently sensitive to detect the small contact forces experienced by a lightweight robot, with an average normal sensitivity of 0.8 grams/hair. The compliant polymer hairs detect both normal and shear contact, allowing the array to detect a variety of contact forces. By virtue of its design, the hair sensor array can be fabricated using a roll-to-roll layered process. We demonstrate a straightforward application of the sensor technology on a hexapedal millirobot, using the array to both estimate average ground speed and detect high-centering when running over obstacles. This application is of particular interest for milliscale robots operating in rough terrain, where the risk of entrapment is high. Our results indicate that the hair sensor array can estimate ground speed and detect high-centering when running over simple geometric obstacles.",

A new hazard avoidance scheme generalizes constraint based reactive algorithms [1], [2] from hard to soft hazards. Reactive controllers operate by directly parameterizing the closedloop dynamics of the system with respect to the environment the robot is operating in. Traditionally, reactive controllers are parameterized by weighting virtual attraction and repulsion forces from goals and obstacles [3], [4]. One pitfall of such parameterizations is sensitivity of the tuning parameters to the operating environment. A reactive controller tuned in one set of conditions is not applicable in another (e.g. a different density of obstacles). The algorithm presented in this paper has two key properties which are significant i) Parameterization is environment independent. ii) It can deal with non-binary environments that contain soft hazards.",

        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "Inferring temporal derivatives (like velocity and acceleration) from a noisy position signal is a well-known challenge in control engineering, due to the intrinsic trade-off between noise filtering and estimation bandwidth. To tackle this problem, in this paper we propose a new approach specifically designed for periodic movements. This approach uses an adaptive oscillator as fundamental building block. It is a tool capable of synchronizing to a periodic input while learning its features (frequency, amplitude, ...) in dedicated state variables. Since the oscillator's input and output are perfectly synchronized during steady-state regime, a non-delayed estimate of the input temporal derivatives can be obtained simply by deriving the output analytical form. Pending a (quasi-)periodic input signal, these temporal derivatives are thus synchronized with the actual kinematics, while the signal bandwidth can be arbitrarily tuned by the intrinsic dynamics of the oscillator. We further validate this approach by developing an impedance-based strategy for assisting human walking in the LOPES lower-limb exoskeleton. Preliminary results with a single participant give rise to three main conclusions. First, our method indeed provides velocity and acceleration estimates of the participant's joint kinematics which are smoother and less delayed with respect to the actual kinematics than using a standard Kalman filter. Second, closing the human-robot loop with a high-gain impedance field depending on the acceleration is not possible with a Kalman filter approach, due to unstable dynamics. In contrast, our approach tolerates high gains (up to 70% of the nominal walking torque), showing its intrinsic stability. Finally, no clear benefit of the acceleration-dependent field with respect to a simpler position-dependent field is visible regarding the reduction of metabolic cost. This last result illustrates the challenge of designing sound assistive strategies for complex tasks like walking... Show More",

        "abstract": "In this paper, we consider the problem of tracking human motion with a 22-DOF kinematic model from depth images. In contrast to existing approaches, our system naturally scales to multiple sensors. The motivation behind our approach, termed Multiple Depth Camera Approach (MDCA), is that by using several cameras, we can significantly improve the tracking quality and reduce ambiguities as for example caused by occlusions. By fusing the depth images of all available cameras into one joint point cloud, we can seamlessly incorporate the available information from multiple sensors into the pose estimation. To track the high-dimensional human pose, we employ state-of-the-art annealed particle filtering and partition sampling. We compute the particle likelihood based on the truncated signed distance of each observed point to a parameterized human shape model. We apply a coarse-to-fine scheme to recognize a wide range of poses to initialize the tracker. In our experiments, we demonstrate that our approach can accurately track human motion in real-time (15Hz) on a GPGPU. In direct comparison to two existing trackers (OpenNI, Microsoft Kinect SDK), we found that our approach is significantly more robust for unconstrained motions and under (partial) occlusions.",

In particular, we consider a group of differential-wheeled robots endowed with noisy relative positioning capabilities. We develop a distributed, real-time optimization method based on a receding horizon controller that minimizes a user-defined cost whilst guaranteeing the rendezvous.

        "track": "main",
        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "Sound Source Localization (SSL) is an essential function for robot audition and yields the location and number of sound sources, which are utilized for post-processes such as sound source separation. SSL for a robot in a real environment mainly requires noise-robustness, high resolution and real-time processing. A technique using microphone array processing, that is, Multiple Signal Classification based on Standard EigenValue Decomposition (SEVD-MUSIC) is commonly used for localization. We improved its robustness against noise with high power by incorporating Generalized EigenValue Decomposition (GEVD). However, GEVD-based MUSIC (GEVD-MUSIC) has mainly two issues: 1) the resolution of pre-measured Transfer Functions (TFs) determines the resolution of SSL, 2) its computational cost is expensive for real-time processing. For the first issue, we propose a TF interpolation method integrating time-domain-based and frequency-domain-based interpolation. The interpolation achieves super-resolution SSL, whose resolution is higher than that of the pre-measured TFs. For the second issue, we propose two methods, MUSIC based on Generalized Singular Value Decomposition (GSVD-MUSIC), and Hierarchical SSL (H-SSL). GSVD-MUSIC drastically reduces the computational cost while maintaining noise-robustness in localization. H-SSL also reduces the computational cost by introducing a hierarchical search algorithm instead of using greedy search in localization. These techniques are integrated into an SSL system using a robot embedded microphone array. The experimental result showed: the proposed interpolation achieved approximately 1 degree resolution although we have only TFs at 30 degree intervals, GSVD-MUSIC attained 46.4% and 40.6% of the computational cost compared to SEVD-MUSIC and GEVD-MUSIC, respectively, H-SSL reduces 59.2% computational cost in localization of a single sound source.",

        "abstract": "This paper presents an algorithm that permits the calculation of interception maneuvers for quadrocopters. The translational degrees of freedom of the quadrocopter are decoupled. Pontryagin's minimum principle is used to show that the interception maneuver that minimizes the time to rest after the interception is identical to the time-optimal maneuver that drives the vehicle to the position at which it comes to rest after the interception. This fact is leveraged to apply previously developed, computationally efficient methods for the computation of interception maneuvers. The resulting trajectory generation algorithm is computationally lightweight, permitting its use as an implicit feedback law by replanning the trajectory at each controller update. The validity and performance of the approach is demonstrated experimentally by intercepting balls mid-flight. The real-time trajectory generation permits to take into account changes in the predicted ball flight path at each controller update.",

In this work the shadows in daylight scenes are used to detect vehicles in low-quality camera images and determine their positions and velocities in relation to the own vehicle. We propose a new algorithm that segments shadows in a top-down-view. In contrast to other works no specific thresholds or strong shadow edges are needed. Instead we binarize the image at multiple thresholds and analyze the results to generate vehicle position hypotheses. These hypotheses are verified with a RANSAC-based temporal verification approach. The accuracy of our method is evaluated using monocular real world sequences and ground truth data. Our algorithm works robustly under various lighting conditions in real-time at full video frame rate.",

An efficient way for obtaining metric velocity of robots without external reference are image-based optical flow measurements, scaled with the distance between camera and the observed scene. However, since optical flow and stereo vision are computationally intensive tasks, metric optical flow calculations on embedded systems are typically only possible at limited frame rate. In this work, we therefore present an FPGA-based platform with the capability of calculating real-time metric optical flow at 127 frames per second and 376\u00d7240 resolution. Radial undistortion, image rectification, disparity estimation and optical flow calculation tasks are performed on a single FPGA without the need for external memory. The platform is perfectly suited for mobile robots or MAVs due to its low weight and low power consumption.",

There are many researches on gait analysis on a hard ground, but few scientists analyze the walking ability of human beings on a soft ground. Therefore, we conducted anthropometric measurement using a motion capture system on a soft ground. By analyzing experimental data, we obtained two findings. The first finding is that although there are no significant differences in step width and step length, step height tends to increase to avoid the collision between the feet and a soft ground. The second finding is that there are no significant differences in the lateral CoM trajectories but the vertical CoM amplitude increases when walking on a soft ground. Based on these findings, we developed a walking stabilization control to stabilize the CoM motion in the lateral direction on a soft ground. Verification of the proposed control is conducted through experiments with a human-sized humanoid robot WABIAN-2R. The experimental videos are supplemented.",

One important type of behavior to recognize is the displaying and seeking of affection, which is fundamentally associated with the modality of touch. This paper identifies how people communicate affection through touching a humanoid robot appearance, and reports on the development of a recognition system exploring the modalities of touch and vision. Results of evaluation indicate the proposed system can recognize people's affectionate behavior in the designated context.",

These gait patterns are generated via inter- and intra-limb coordination mechanisms, both of which are controlled in part by an intraspinal neural network called the central pattern generator (CPG). Previous CPG-based models mainly focused on the inter-limb coordination mechanisms and not on the intra-limb coordination mechanisms, although both of them should play a pivotal role in generating various gait patterns. In this study, we present an autonomous decentralized control scheme for quadruped locomotion wherein inter- and intra-limb coordination mechanisms are well coupled. Simulation results show that the quadruped exhibits transitioning between walking and running and the ability to adapt to changes in body properties by appropriately modifying the phase relationship among body points through well-balanced coupling of the inter- and intra-limb coordination mechanisms. We also present a physical robot that we are currently developing.",

As a result of the experimental comparison, we propose two enhancements. The first is to filter the singular values of the Jacobian matrix before calculating its pseudoinverse in order to obtain a more numerically robust result. The second is to combine a continuous task priority strategy with selective damping to generate smoother trajectories. Experimentation on the WAM robot arm shows that these two enhancements yield an IK algorithm that improves on the reviewed state-of-the-art ones, in terms of the good compromise it achieves between time step length, Jacobian conditioning, multiple task performance, and computational time, thus constituting a very solid option in practice. This proposal is general and applicable to other redundant robots.",

        "abstract": "Stochastic resonance (SR) is a phenomenon by which the immeasurable input signals of a non-linear system can be observed in the output signals by adding a non-zero level of noise. So far, this phenomenon has been intensively studied, but no methodology for its use in engineering applications has been established yet. To exploit SR in engineering, and, in particular, to determine the appropriate noise variance that optimizes the SR performance, remains an open problem. In this study, we propose a method, which exploits the non- linear correlation between outputs from a set of redundant sensors subject to different noise sources, to tune the noise variance. Because the proposed method does not require the input signal information, it allows the exploitation of SR in realistic engineering problems. The proposed method is validated by information theory and numerical simulations. Based on the results, we developed a tactile sensing system that utilizes the method. Experimental results demonstrate that the tactile sensing system can sense immeasurable signals which are smaller than the quantization error of the sensing system.",

        "abstract": "This paper presents a novel object detection and segmentation method utilizing an inpainting algorithm. Inpainting is a concept of recovering missing image regions based on their surroundings, which were originally used for restoration of damaged paintings. In this paper, we newly utilize inpainting to judge whether an object candidate region includes the foreground object or not. The key idea is that if we erase a certain region from an image, the inpainting algorithm is expected to recover the erased image only when it belongs a background area (i.e. only when there is no object in it). By measuring the similarity between the inpainted region and the original image region, our approach filters out false detections while maintaining true object detections. Furthermore, we take advantage of the inpainting for object segmentation, since our approach is designed to explicitly distinguish foreground areas from its background. Experimental results confirm that our approach applied to baseline detectors enables better recognition of objects, obtaining higher accuracies. We illustrate how our inpainting-based detection/segmentation approach benefits the object detection using two different pedestrian datasets.",

The human-robot system consists of three components: human user, wheelchair robot and the noninvasive brain-computer interface (BCI) which can represent limit types of user's intention patterns based on EEG signals, with insufficient decoding accuracy and time delay. To achieve efficient navigation and positioning under condition of decoding uncertainties of the BCI, three cooperative modes are proposed for specific situations based on trade-off of robot's autonomy and user's flexibility. The coding protocol in each mode is elucidated in detail, and strategies of mode switching are developed. To achieve continuous and smooth motion, a look-ahead visual feedback is applied, so that the user can adjust the intention and/or actively correct extraction error of the BCI before the robot reaches current path node, and consequently, reliable planning and execution are ensured. The effectiveness of the strategies is evaluated by simulations.",

These are less-than-accurate assumptions. It is desirable to extend Llewellyn's result to the cases where the operator or the environment is non-passive. This paper revisits Llewellyn's criterion and relaxes the assumption of passivity for one of the terminations. The possibly non-passive termination is realistically assumed to have a complex impedance with an upper or lower bound on its amplitude or real part, respectively. Although the proposed stability criteria are useful for any application of two-port network systems, we specifically apply them on bilateral teleoperation systems and find the stability conditions when the operator or the environment is not passive; this is a result that Llewellyn's absolute stability criterion cannot afford.",

        "abstract": "Intrinsically elastic joints have become increasingly popular over the last years. Commonly, they are considered to outperform rigid actuation in terms of peak dynamics, robustness, and energy efficiency. In particular, the possible increase of link speed by adequate motor excitation trajectories, such that the elastic transmission temporarily stores elastic energy and then timely converts it into kinetic link energy, is a new control problem in robotics. However, despite being a popular argument in favor of elastic actuation, it was not shown yet that this potential speed gain is truly inherent to the physical properties of the mechanism. In order to argue that \u201celasticity is superior to input torque\u201d, i.e. size and weight, it still needs to be derived that this new feature does not come at the cost of increasing weight for a given actuation technology. Therefore, we analyze, under which circumstances \u201cextracting\u201d a certain amount of mass from a rigid joint and \u201cinvesting\u201d this into an elastic mechanism in the drive train leads to such a performance increase. For this, we derive the general scaling behavior of rigid joints and compare their capabilities in terms of maximum velocity to the performance behavior of an elastic joint, while taking into consideration the most important real-world constraints.",

        "abstract": "We present a novel approach for vision-based road direction detection for autonomous Unmanned Ground Vehicles (UGVs). The proposed method utilizes only monocular vision information similar to human perception to detect road directions with respect to the vehicle. The algorithm searches for a global feature of the roads due to perspective projection (so-called vanishing point) to distinguish road directions. The proposed approach consists of two stages. The first stage estimates the vanishing-point locations from single frames. The second stage uses a Rao-Blackwellised particle filter to track initial vanishing-point estimations over a sequence of images in order to provide more robust estimation. Simultaneously, the direction of the road ahead of the vehicle is predicted, which is prerequisite information for vehicle steering and path planning. The proposed approach assumes minimum prior knowledge about the environment and can cope with complex situations such as ground cover variations, different illuminations, and cast shadows. Its performance is evaluated on video sequences taken during test run of the DARPA Grand Challenge.",

If robots are to become an integral part of our society, they must possess the ability to learn without direct guidance from a dedicated user. Robot owners will not enjoy the duty of teaching their robot everything it knows. The ability for a robot to utilize various resources in its environment will enable its learning capabilities to be self-guided and independent. This paper investigates the use of social media crowdsourcing to allow a robot to access the vast information gathering resources available on Twitter. Specifically, the robot will record a human performing simple physical actions, upload the video to its Twitter account, and ask its followers for a description of the actions. The recorded parameters of each action is utilized as input into a multi-class support vector machine (MC-SVM) classification algorithm, which will enable the robot to recognize the action at a future time.",

        "abstract": "Modern robotics frameworks are based on modular architectures that enable them to cope with the complexity and diversity of today's robotics applications. The encapsulation of the framework modules is the key to their reuse in various robotics scenarios. Model-driven approaches further simplify the reuse of already implemented and tested modules by enabling developers to model their applications on a higher abstraction level incorporating existing modules [1]. Unfortunately, these features are only present for the implementation of the robot behavior itself, but not for the accompanying user interfaces (UIs). The contributions of this paper are threefold: In a first step we introduce the idea of dedicated robotics UI frameworks which allow the reuse of UIs across robotics frameworks. The paper then presents an architecture for flexible and versatile UI frameworks for robotics applications by investigating and specifying the necessary features for such systems on a platform and programming language independent basis. The introduced ROBOTUI architecture fosters code reuse on the level of self-contained UI modules and enables the user to build new robotics related UIs based on existing UI building blocks. Finally, we present an implementation of the proposed architecture that demonstrates the advantages of a dedicated UI framework and the high level of code reuse achieved by implementing the modular ROBOTUI architecture.",

        "abstract": "Surgical robots are gaining favor in part due to their capacity to reach remote locations within the body. Continuum robots are especially well suited for accessing deep spaces such as cerebral ventricles within the brain. Due to the entry point constraints and complicated structure, current techniques do not allow surgeons to access the full volume of the ventricles. The ability to access the ventricles with a dexterous robot would have significant clinical implications. This paper presents a concentric tube manipulator mated to a robotically controlled flexible endoscope. The device adds three degrees of freedom to the standard neuroendoscope and roboticizes the entire package allowing the operator to conveniently manipulate the device. To demonstrate the improved functionality, we use an in-silica virtual model as well as an ex-vivo anatomic model of a patient with a treatable form of hydrocephalus. In these experiments we demonstrate that the augmented and roboticized endoscope can efficiently reach critical regions that a manual scope cannot.",

In this paper, we primarily discuss two kinds of key technologies, long-distance autonomous travel in an outdoor environment and obstacle avoidance in a human-shared environment. For the localization and navigation methods, we propose sub-map dividing and realignment with FastSLAM, which enables generation of large-scale 3D voxel maps by the sampling based SLAM method. For the planning and obstacle avoidance methods, we propose motion control by a combination of the global/local A* algorithm and the dynamic window approach. To confirm the effectiveness of our proposed methods, the results of demonstration experiments using our robotic wheelchair \u2018Marcus\u2019 in the Tsukuba Robot Zone are also reported.",

Assistive mobile manipulators (AMMs) are mobile robots that physically manipulate the world in order to provide assistance to people with disabilities. They present an exciting frontier for assistive technology, as they can operate away from the user, have a large dexterous workspace (due to their mobility), and not directly encumber their users. The cornerstone of this project is an ongoing, interactive design process with a quadriplegic user, Henry Evans, and his wife and primary caregiver, Jane Evans.

        "abstract": "This paper is concerned with the unsupervised learning of object representations by fusing visual and motor information. The problem is posed for a mobile robot that develops its representations as it incrementally gathers data. The scenario is problematic as the robot only has limited information at each time step with which it must generate and update its representations. Object representations are refined as multiple instances of sensory data are presented; however, it is uncertain whether two data instances are synonymous with the same object. This process can easily diverge from stability. The premise of the presented work is that a robot's motor information instigates successful generation of visual representations. An understanding of self-motion enables a prediction to be made before performing an action, resulting in a stronger belief of data association. The system is implemented as a data-driven partially observable semi-Markov decision process. Object representations are formed as the process's hidden states and are coordinated with motor commands through state transitions. Experiments show the prediction process is essential in enabling the unsupervised learning method to converge to a solution - improving precision and recall over using sensory data alone.",

        "abstract": "In search and rescue missions, Micro Air Vehicles (MAV's) can assist rescuers to faster locate victims inside a large search area and to coordinate their efforts. Acoustic signals play an important role in outdoor rescue operations. Emergency whistles, as found on most aircraft life vests, are commonly carried by people engaging in outdoor activities, and are also used by rescue teams, as they allow to signal reliably over long distances and far beyond visibility. For a MAV involved in such missions, the ability to locate the source of a distress sound signal, such as an emergency whistle blown by a person in need of help, is therefore significantly important and would allow the localization of victims and rescuers during night time, through foliage and in adverse conditions such as dust, fog and smoke. In this paper we present a sound source localization system for a MAV to locate narrowband sound sources on the ground, such as the sound of a whistle or personal alarm siren. We propose a method based on a particle filter to combine information from the cross correlation between signals of four spatially separated microphones mounted on the MAV, the dynamics of the aerial platform, and the doppler shift in frequency of the sound due to the motion of the MAV. Furthermore, we evaluate our proposed method in a real world experiment where a flying micro air vehicle is used to locate and track the position of a narrowband sound source on the ground.",

However state-of-art approaches often consider the task of pose estimation with respect to an object where the ratio between the furthest and closest point is small. Localisation in the context of simultaneous localisation and mapping (SLAM) violates this constraint and the naive application of PnP algorithms can lead to biased and imprecise estimates. In this article, we explore weighted object-space errors to provide an efficient, accurate and robust pose estimation solution. State-of-the-art results are shown in realistic scenarios and a practical vision framework is proposed that can be used for visual SLAM.

This scheme allows us to capture the characteristics of the target local appearance, and promotes the robustness against partial occlusions during tracking. Additionally, we unify the sparse coding and online dictionary learning by defining a \u201csparsity consistency constraint\u201d that facilitates the generative and discriminative capabilities of the appearance model. Moreover, we propose a robust similarity metric that can eliminate the outliers from the corrupted observations. We then integrate the proposed appearance model with the particle filter framework to form a robust visual tracking algorithm. Experiments on publicly available benchmark video sequences demonstrate that the proposed appearance model improves the tracking performance compared with other state-of-the-art approaches.",

In this paper, we propose a novel approach to recognize objects and estimate their 6-DOF pose using 3D feature descriptors, called Geometric and Photometric Local Feature (GPLF). The proposed descriptors use both the geometric and photometric information of 3D point clouds from RGB-D camera and integrate those information into efficient descriptors. GPLF shows robust discriminative performance regardless of characteristics such as shapes or appearances of objects in cluttered scenes. The experimental results show how well the proposed approach classifies and identify objects. The performance of pose estimation is robust and stable enough for the robot to manipulate objects. We also compare the proposed approach with previous approaches that use partial information of objects with a representative large-scale RGB-D object dataset.",

        "abstract": "This paper presents a head and hands tracking method with a monocular camera for human machine interaction (HMI). The targets are tracked independently when they are far from each other, however, they are merged with dependent likelihood measurements in higher dimension while they are likely to interrupt each other. When tracking one target in the independent situation, other targets are masked to decrease the disturbances of skin color on the tracked one. Multiple clues, including the combination of the locally discriminative color weighted image and the back-projection image of the reference color model, the motion history image and the gradient orientation feature, are employed to verify the hypotheses originated from the particle filter. On the other hand, when the head and hands are closing or even overlapping, the multiple importance sampling (MIS) particle filter generates the tracking hypotheses of merged targets by the skin blob mask and the depth order estimation. These merged hypotheses are then evaluated by the visual cues of occluded face template, hand shape orientation and motion continuity. The experimental results present the real-time efficiency and the robustness in comparison with the OpenNI tracker which has been released recently for the Kinect sensor.",

While many approaches for autonomous visual control of such vehicles rely on powerful ground stations, the increasing availability of small and light hardware allows for the design of more independent systems. In this context, we present a robust algorithm able to recover the UAV ego-motion using a monocular camera and on-board hardware. Our method exploits the continuous homography constraint so as to discriminate among the observed feature points in order to classify those belonging to the dominant plane in the scene. Extensive experiments on a real quadrotor UAV demonstrate that the estimation of the scaled linear velocity in a cluttered environment improved by a factor of 25% compared to previous approaches.",

        "abstract": "Popular problems in robotics and computer vision like simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) or structure from motion (SfM) require to solve a least-squares problem that can be effectively represented by factor graphs. The chance to find the global minimum of such problems depends on both the initial guess and the non-linearity of the sensor models. In this paper we propose an approach to determine an approximation of the original problem that has a larger convergence basin. To this end, we employ a divide-and-conquer approach that exploits the structure of the factor graph. Our approach has been validated on real-world and simulated experiments and is able to succeed in finding the global minimum in situations where other state-of-the-art methods fail.",

In this paper, we propose a statistically-robust randomized planning algorithm for a model-free eye-in-hand manipulator. The planner is built on the success and efficiency of the sampling-based planners, while incorporating robustness to outliers. In particular, we generalize the Rapidly-Exploring Random Tree (RRT) planner to the visual-motor space, the space that encodes both visual measurements and motor readings. The proposed planner is used in conjunction with a closed-loop visual control law. While the control law is entirely image based, the planner helps avoid joint limits, field-of-view constraints, and more importantly, visual occlusion of the target by unmodeled obstacles. The algorithm is validated in simulations as well as experiments with a WAM robot arm.",

        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "Physical properties of an object, such as compliance, are important pieces of information for dexterous handling of the robot hand, and for the locomotion of the legged robot. It is effective to adopt the active sensing method in which a robot pushes the object and senses the reaction force and sequential deformation such as passive rotation of the joint due to the force, to determine the properties. However, the sensors attached to the contact point and the joint tend to break because of an iterative contact or an excessive force. Herein, we propose a method for estimating the force and the consequent joint displacement without attaching sensors to the contact point and the joint. The elastic pneumatic muscle is adopted as an actuator, and the force and joint angle are measured using the inner pressure of the muscle before and after the muscle is extended because of the force. Using the nonlinear model of a one degree of freedom (1-DoF) joint mechanism driven by antagonistic pneumatic muscles, we can estimate the force and the angle, and using the joint mechanism, we can detect in the difference of the compliance of the object. This approach provides the robust robot hand, which can estimate the contact information, including the force and joint displacement, without the need to attach sensors to the fingertip and the joint for example.",

There still remain several problems in visual servoing methods although they are quite useful and effective for dexterous object manipulation. For instance, time-delays to obtain necessary information for object manipulation from visual images induce unstable behavior. The time-delays are mainly caused by low sampling rate of visual sensing system, computational cost for image processing, and latency of data transmission from visual sensor to processor. The method makes it possible to avoid such unstable behavior of the systems due to considerable time-delays using virtual object frame defined by only each joint angle. Firstly, a new control scheme for object manipulation using the virtual object frame is designed. Next, numerical simulations are conducted to verify the effectiveness of the control scheme. Finally, experimental results are shown to demonstrate the practical usefulness of proposed method.",

Initial burst part of EMG is prior to the onset of actual movement by dozens to hundreds milliseconds. Using this property, the proposed method makes the ternary choice prediction among rock-paper-scissors as soon as 10% motion variation of any finger is detected.

However, as the speed of a robot increases, stability becomes another issue because it is directly related to the mobility of the robot. Without stability, the robot is exposed to risks of overturn. Therefore, a mobile robot needs to be not only maneuverable but also stable. We present a new mobile platform named \u201cRocker-Pillar\u201d which enables a robot to overcome rough terrains with stability. The robot is composed of two sets of caterpillar tracks, four wheels, and a pair of two linkages. The robot can travel a rugged terrain at a speed 50m/min while maintaining stability, and can overcome complex terrains such as holes, steps without frontal sides, and stairs. The robot can overcome a hole 1.5 times larger than the wheel diameter of the robot and a step without the frontal side that is 1.25 times higher than wheel diameter.",

        "abstract": "Human's spinal reflexes response rapidly to the change of states of muscles, therefore, they are supposed to play an important role for dynamic motion. In order to realize three dimensional stable jumping, rapid control system is indispensable. In this paper, we investigate contribution of the stretch reflex for stabilizing roll motion of continuous jumping by constructing a musculoskeletal biped robot. By conducting numerical simulation and robot experiments, we show that the stretch reflex in the Soleus muscle effectively stabilizes the roll motion of the robot. Through investigation, we confirmed that roll motion was partially stabilized by implementation of the stretch reflex in the soleus muscle. This study may lead to understanding the role of spinal reflexes in human jumping and to realization of robust jumping of bipedal robots.",

        "abstract": "Mobile robots need an effective spatial model for the successful operation in real-world environment. The model should be compact and simultaneously possess large expressive power. Moreover, it should scale well. In this paper we propose a new hierarchical representation of space, whose compositional structure is learned based on statistically significant observations. We have focused on a two dimensional space, since many robots perceive their surroundings in two dimensions with the use of a laser range finder or a sonar. We also propose the use of a low-level image descriptor for addressing the room classification problem, by which we demonstrate the performance of our representation. Using only the lower layers of the hierarchy, we obtain state-of-the-art classification results on demanding datasets.",

        "abstract": "This paper presents a reactive collision avoidance method for small unmanned rotorcraft using spherical image-based visual servoing. Only a single point feature is used to guide the aircraft in a safe spiral like trajectory around the target, whilst a spherical camera model ensures the target always remains visible. A decision strategy to stop the avoidance control is derived based on the properties of spiral like motion, and the effect of accurate range measurements on the control scheme is discussed. We show that using a poor range estimate does not significantly degrade the collision avoidance performance, thus relaxing the need for accurate range measurements. We present simulated and experimental results using a small quad rotor to validate the approach.",

        "abstract": "The SFly project is an EU-funded project, with the goal to create a swarm of autonomous vision controlled micro aerial vehicles. The mission in mind is that a swarm of MAV's autonomously maps out an unknown environment, computes optimal surveillance positions and places the MAV's there and then locates radio beacons in this environment. The scope of the work includes contributions on multiple different levels ranging from theoretical foundations to hardware design and embedded programming. One of the contributions is the development of a new MAV, a hexacopter, equipped with enough processing power for onboard computer vision. A major contribution is the development of monocular visual SLAM that runs in real-time onboard of the MAV. The visual SLAM results are fused with IMU measurements and are used to stabilize and control the MAV. This enables autonomous flight of the MAV, without the need of a data link to a ground station. Within this scope novel analytical solutions for fusing IMU and vision measurements have been derived. In addition to the realtime local SLAM, an offline dense mapping process has been developed. For this the MAV's are equipped with a payload of a stereo camera system. The dense environment map is used to compute optimal surveillance positions for a swarm of MAV's. For this an optimiziation technique based on cognitive adaptive optimization has been developed. Finally, the MAV's have been equipped with radio transceivers and a method has been developed to locate radio beacons in the observed environment.",

        "abstract": "In roadmap-based methods, such as the Probabilistic Roadmap Method (PRM) in deterministic environments or the Feedback-based Information RoadMap (FIRM) in partially observable probabilistic environments, a stabilizing controller is needed to guarantee node reachability in state or belief space. In belief space, it has been shown that belief-node reachability can be achieved using stationary Linear Quadratic Gaussian (LQG) controllers, for linearly controllable systems. However, for nonholonomic systems such as a unicycle model, belief reachability is a challenge. In this paper, we construct a roadmap in information space, where the local planners in partially-observable space are constructed by utilizing a Kalman filter as an estimator along with a Dynamic Feedback Linearization-based (DFL-based) controller as the belief controller. As a consequence, the task of belief stabilization to pre-defined nodes in belief space is accomplished even for nonholonomic systems. Therefore, a query-independent roadmap is generated in belief space that preserves the \u201cprinciple of optimality\u201d, required in dynamic programming solvers. This method serves as an offline POMDP solver for motion planning in belief space, which can seamlessly take obstacles into account. Experimental results show the efficiency of both individual local planners and the overall planner over the information graph for a nonholonomic model.",

The structures to be inspected are segmented to isolate planar areas, and back-and-forth sweep paths are generated to view as much of these planar areas as possible while avoiding collision. A randomized planning procedure fills in the remaining gaps in coverage. The problem of selecting an order to traverse the elements of the inspection is solved by reduction to the traveling salesman problem. We present results of the planning algorithm for an autonomous underwater vehicle inspecting the in-water portion of a ship hull.

A prototype robotic-hand system based on this architecture was constructed. The system experimentally demonstrated 62%-reduced control latency and 6.5-times faster sensor-data processing, thus achieving seven times greater performance scalability as compared with a conventional controller architecture. As a result, the proposed architecture enables the robotic-hand system to grasp objects with different weights and hardnesses.",

In order to improve the convergence basin for NDT, a multi-scale k-means NDT (MSKM-NDT) variant is proposed. This approach divides the point cloud using k-means clustering and performs the optimization step at multiple scales of cluster sizes. The k-means clustering approach guarantees that the optimization will converge, as it resolves the issue of discontinuities in the cost function found in the standard NDT algorithm. The optimization step of the NDT algorithm is performed over a decreasing scale, which greatly improves the basin of convergence. Experiments show that this approach can be used to register partially overlapping scans with large initial transformation error.",

        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "Probe-based confocal laser endomicroscopy is a recent tissue imaging technology that requires placing a probe in contact with the tissue to be imaged and provides real time images with a microscopic resolution. Additionally, generating adequate probe movements to sweep the tissue surface can be used to reconstruct a wide mosaic of the scanned region while increasing the resolution which is appropriate for anatomico-pathological cancer diagnosis. However, properly controlling the motion along the scanning trajectory is a major problem. Indeed, the tissue exhibits deformations under friction forces exerted by the probe leading to deformed mosaics. In this paper we propose a visual servoing approach for controlling the probe movements relative to the tissue while rejecting the tissue deformation disturbance. The probe displacement with respect to the tissue is firstly estimated using the confocal images and an image registration real-time algorithm. Secondly, from this real-time image-based position measurement, the probe motion is controlled thanks to a simple proportional-integral compensator and a feedforward term. Ex vivo experiments using a St\u00e4ubli TX40 robot and a Mauna Kea Technologies Cellvizio imaging device demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach on liver and muscle tissue.",

        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "A wide class of multirobot control tasks involves operator interactions with individual robots. Where the robots' actions are independent, as for example in some foraging tasks, the operator can interact with robots sequentially in a round robin fashion. If the need for interaction can be detected by the robot through self-reflection, the robot could communicate its need for interaction to the operator. The resulting human-robot system would form a queuing system in which the operator is the server and the queue of robots requesting interaction, the jobs. As a queuing system, performance could be optimized using standard techniques, providing the operator's attention could be appropriately directed. An earlier study found that Human-Robot Interaction (HRI) performance was improved by communicating requests for interaction to the operator, however, a first-in-first-out (FIFO) aid showing a single request at a time led to poorer performance than one showing the entire (Open) queue. The current experiment compared Open-queue and FIFO conditions from the first experiment with a Priority-queue using a shortest job first (SJF) discipline known to maximize throughput. Performance in the Priority-queue condition was statistically indistinguishable from the best performance for all measures except those for missed victims where it was intermediate between FIFO (best) and Open-queue. Both of the other conditions produced poorest performance on some measures. The results suggest that operator attention can be effectively scheduled allowing the use of scheduling algorithms to improve the efficiency of HRI.",

The glider has to perform oceanographic measurements, mainly conductivity, temperature and depth, in the area enclosed by the drifters and can not rely on GNSS (Global Navigation Satellite System) positionning data as the polar ice cap makes it impossible to surface. The originality of the presented method resides in 2 points. First, a very simple PID (Proportional, Integral and Derivative) controller based on a basic kinematic model is tuned. Second, the method does not use a localization algorithm to estimate state space model data but interval analysis methods are performed to bound the errors in range to the transponder and its derivative. Moreover, only one acoustic beacon is used. Validation is then performed through simulations.",

        "abstract": "Inertial-SLAM has been actively studied as it can provide all-terrain navigational capability with full six degrees-of-freedom information to autonomous robots. With the recent availability of low-cost inertial and vision sensors, a light-weight and accurate mapping system could be achieved for many robotic tasks such as land/aerial explorations. The key challenge toward this is in the availability of reliable and constant aiding information to correct the inertial system which is intrinsically unstable. The existing approaches have been relying on feature-based maps, which require accurate depth-resolution process to correct the inertial units properly where the aiding rate is highly dependent on the map density. In this work we propose to directly integrate the visual odometry to the inertial system by fusing the scale ambiguous translation vectors as Visual Directional Constraints (VDC) on vehicle motion at high update rates, while the 3D map being still used to constrain the longitudinal drifts but in a relaxed way. In this way, the visual odometry information can be seamlessly fused to inertial system by resolving the scale ambiguity problem between inertial and monocular camera thus achieving a reliable and constant aiding. The proposed approach is evaluated on SLAM benchmark dataset and simulated environment, showing a more stable and consistent performance of monocular inertial-SLAM.",

The presented work investigates the impact of using na\u00efve vs. optimized search patterns on localizing a drifting object, including a surrogate ocean model using idealized flow with Weibull-distributed perturbations. Numerical studies and extensive analysis using different permutations of model parameters (including the relative speed of the drifting object, time late in the searcher's arrival to the search area, sensor sweep width, and duration of the search mission) identify the significant factors affecting the overall probability of detection. Such insights enable further explorations using empirical datasets for specific oceanographic regions of interest.",

While handling single objects on a table is solved, handling complex scenes poses considerable problems due to clutter and occlusion. After pre-segmentation of the input image based on surface normals, surface patches are estimated using a mixture of planes and NURBS (non-uniform rational B-splines) and model selection is employed to find the best representation for the given data. We then construct a graph from surface patches and relations between pairs of patches and perform graph cut to arrive at object hypotheses segmented from the scene. The energy terms for patch relations are learned from user annotated training data, where support vector machines (SVM) are trained to classify a relation as being indicative of two patches belonging to the same object. We show evaluation of the relations and results on a database of different test sets, demonstrating that the approach can segment objects of various shapes in cluttered table top scenes.",

        "abstract": "Human infants practice their initial, seemingly random arm movements for transforming them into voluntary reaching and grasping actions. With the developing perceptual abilities, infants further explore their environment using the behavior repertoire they have developed, and learn causality relations in the form of affordances, which they use for goal satisfaction and motor planning. This study proposes and implements a developmental progression on a robotic system mimicking the aforementioned infant development stages: An anthropomorphic robot hand with one basic action of swing-hand and the palmar reflex (i.e. the enclosure of the fingers upon contact) at its disposal, executes swing-hand action targeted to a salient object with different hand speeds. During the executions, it monitors the changes in its sensors, automatically forming behavior primitives such as \u2018grasp\u2019, \u2018hit\u2019, \u2018carry-object\u2019 and \u2018drop\u2019 by segmenting and differentiating the initial swing-hand action. The study then focuses on one of these behaviors, namely grasping, and shows how further practice allows the robot to learn affordances of more complex objects, which can be further used to make plans to achieve desired goals using the discovered behavior repertoire.",

The quick energy releasing function of the jumping mechanism is implemented by using an eccentric cam. The self-righting, steering, and takeoff angle adjusting capabilities are achieved by adding a rotatable pole leg. The pole leg can prop up the body of the robot when it falls down. The pole leg can also steer the robot to turn at a step of about 24\u00b0. By adjusting the center of mass (COM), the robot can jump at different takeoff angles. Experimental results show that the constructed robot can jump more than 88 cm high at a takeoff angle of 82.7\u00b0 and it can continuously jump to overcome stairs.",

        "abstract": "In this article we investigate the representation and acquisition of Semantic Objects Maps (SOMs) that can serve as information resources for autonomous service robots performing everyday manipulation tasks in kitchen environments. These maps provide the robot with information about its operation environment that enable it to perform fetch and place tasks more efficiently and reliably. To this end, the semantic object maps can answer queries such as the following ones: \u201cWhat do parts of the kitchen look like?\u201d, \u201cHow can a container be opened and closed?\u201d, \u201cWhere do objects of daily use belong?\u201d, \u201cWhat is inside of cupboards/drawers?\u201d, etc. The semantic object maps presented in this article, which we call SOM+, extend the first generation of SOMs presented by Rusu et al. [1] in that the representation of SOM+ is designed more thoroughly and that SOM+ also include knowledge about the appearance and articulation of furniture objects. Also, the acquisition methods for SOM+ substantially advance those developed in [1] in that SOM+ are acquired autonomously and with low-cost (Kinect) instead of very accurate (laser-based) 3D sensors. In addition, perception methods are more general and are demonstrated to work in different kitchen environments.",

In contrast to other approaches, and particularly Support Vector Machines, which probably are the most used method for this task to date, GPs have the major advantage of providing informative uncertainty estimates about the resulting class labels. As we show in experiments, these uncertainty estimates can either be used to improve the classification by neglecting uncertain class labels or - more importantly - they can serve as an indication of the under-representation of certain classes in the training data. This means that GP classifiers are much better suited in a lifelong learning framework, where not all classes are represented initially, but instead new training data arrives during the operation of the robot.",

We propose to use partial object geometry, tactile contacts, and hand kinematic data as proxies to encode semantic constraints, which are task-related constraints. We introduce a semantic affordance map, which relates local geometry to a set of predefined semantic grasps that are appropriate to different tasks. Using this map, the pose of a robotic hand can be estimated so that the hand is adjusted to achieve the ideal approach direction required by a particular task. A grasp planner is then used to generate a set of final grasps which have appropriate stability, tactile contacts, and hand kinematics along this approach direction. We show experiments planning semantic grasps on everyday objects and executing these grasps with a physical robot.",

When this information is made persistent in a semantic map, it can be used, e. g., to communicate with humans. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to learning such maps. Our approach registers measurements of RGB-D cameras by means of simultaneous localization and mapping. We employ random decision forests to segment object classes in images and exploit dense depth measurements to obtain scale-invariance. Our object recognition method integrates shape and texture seamlessly. The probabilistic segmentation from multiple views is filtered in a voxel-based 3D map using a Bayesian framework. We report on the quality of our object-class segmentation method and demonstrate the benefits in accuracy when fusing multiple views in a semantic map.",

This paper overviews a semi-autonomous approach to the inspection problem consisting of an autonomous Micro Aerial Vehicle (MAV) to be used as part of this fleet and which is in charge of regularly supplying images that can effectively teleport the surveyor from a base station to the areas of the hull to be inspected. Specific image processing software to analyze those images and assist the surveyor during the repair/no repair decision making process is also contributed. The control software approach adopted for the MAV, including self-localization and obstacle avoidance, is described and discussed, and experimental results in this regard are as well reported.",

        "abstract": "One reason why control of biomimetic robots is so difficult is the fact that we do not have sufficiently accurate mathematical models of their system dynamics. Recent nonparametric machine learning approaches to system identification have shown good promise, outperforming parameterized mathematical models when applied to complex robot system identification problems. Unfortunately, non-parametric methods perform poorly when applied to regions of the state space that are not densely covered by the training dataset. This problem becomes particularly critical as the state space grows. Parametric methods use the available data very efficiently but, on the flip side, they only provide crude approximations to the actual system dynamics. In practice the systematic deviations between the parametric mathematical model and its physical realization results in control laws that do not take advantage of the compliance and complex dynamics of the robot. Here we present an approach to robot system identification, named Semi-Parametric Gaussian Processes (SGP), that elegantly combines the advantages of parametric and non-parametric approaches. Computer simulations and a physical implementation of an underactuated robot system identification problem show very promising results. We also demonstrate the applicability of SGP to articulated tree-structured robots of arbitrary complexity. In all experiments, SGP significantly out-performed previous parametric and non-parametric approaches as well as previous methods for combining the two approaches.",

Thousands of sensors on the surface of the fish's body detect the pattern of amplitude and phase distortions of the field caused by nearby objects. Prior research has suggested that phase distortions may be especially useful for recognition of live objects. Here we present the first study of the utility of phase information in a robotic implementation of active electrosense. Using our robotic implementation, we investigated how the phase information depends on the frequency of the emitted field, the conductivity of the surrounding water, and object properties. An analytical model was developed serving as qualitative explanation of the dependency. We show that in certain situations phase information enables discrimination between two objects that are otherwise very similar in the amplitude of their electric images. We also show the utility of probing objects with multiple frequencies.",

        "abstract": "At present, autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) mine countermeasure (MCM) surveys are pre-planned by operators using ladder or zig-zag paths. Such surveys are often conducted with side-looking sonar sensors whose performance is dependant on a number of environment factors, as well as lateral range from the AUV track. This research presents a sensor driven online approach to seabed coverage for MCM. A method is presented where paths are planned adaptively using a multi-objective optimization. Information theory is combined with a new concept coined branch entropy based on a hexagonal cell decomposition. The result is a planning algorithm that often produces shorter paths than conventional means and is also capable of accounting for environmental factors detected in situ. Hardware-in-the-loop simulations and in water trials conducted on the IVER2 AUV show the effectiveness of the proposed method.",

We construct a sensor fusion based system to integrate the information from both sensors by using a data association approach - Covariance Intersection (CI). It will be used to increase the robustness and reliability of HRI in the real world environment. In this paper, we propose a Behavior System for analyzing human features and classifying the behavior by the crucial information from sensor fusion system. The system is used to infer the human behavioral intentions, and also allow the robot to perform more natural and intelligent interaction. We apply a spatial model based on proxemics rules to our robot, and design a behavioral intention inference strategy. Furthermore, the robot will make the corresponding reaction in accordance with the identified behavioral intention.",

Our work is motivated by rapid response missions by emergency personnel, in which the capability for one or more people to rapidly map a complex indoor environment is essential for public safety. Human-portable mapping raises a number of challenges not encountered in typical robotic mapping applications including complex 6-DOF motion and the traversal of challenging trajectories including stairs or elevators. Our system achieves robust performance in these situations by exploiting state-of-the-art techniques for robust pose graph optimization and loop closure detection. It achieves real-time performance in indoor environments of moderate scale. Experimental results are demonstrated for human-portable mapping of several floors of a university building, demonstrating the system's ability to handle motion up and down stairs and to organize initially disconnected sets of submaps in a complex environment.",

        "abstract": "Current manufacturing practices require complete physical separation between people and active industrial robots. These precautions ensure safety, but are inefficient in terms of time and resources, and place limits on the types of tasks that can be performed. In this paper, we present a real-time, sensor-based approach for ensuring the safety of people in close proximity to robots in an industrial workcell. Our approach fuses data from multiple 3D imaging sensors of different modalities into a volumetric evidence grid and segments the volume into regions corresponding to background, robots, and people. Surrounding each robot is a danger zone that dynamically updates according to the robot's position and trajectory. Similarly, surrounding each person is a dynamically updated safety zone. A collision between danger and safety zones indicates an impending actual collision, and the affected robot is stopped until the problem is resolved. We demonstrate and experimentally evaluate the concept in a prototype industrial workcell augmented with stereo and range cameras.",

        "abstract": "This paper addresses the issue of creating a sensor model for a new short-range 24GHz close proximity detection (CPD) radar. The CPD radar is designed to provide improved situational awareness to the driver of a large vehicle. It is able to detect light vehicles and other targets at ranges from 2.2m to 45m within an arc of 160\u00b0 azimuth, but radar measurements contain data from noise and clutter which must be filtered out. Dynamic thresholds such as constant false-alarm rate (CFAR) processors [19] do not work well with short measurement vectors or targets that occupy multiple measurement bins. In this paper, a new method is used where measurements of environmental noise, clutter and targets are used to calculate the false alarm and target detection probabilities for each bin and develop a fixed detection threshold for each bin. This filter is used to construct a sensor model which maps measurement power to probability of bin occupancy, which is then used to generate an occupancy grid map of the environment from CPD radar measurements.",

The high redundancy provides high operation flexibility but also introduces redundancy resolution problems. The existing methods mainly focus on the off-line redundancy resolution, and most of them are based on single objective optimization. However, in order to efficiently accomplish a specific task, the dynamic environment information, task constraints and requirements should be considered. This paper investigates a new method which employs the onboard sensor information to resolve the redundancy online by realizing multiple objectives optimization. The effectiveness of this method is demonstrated by simulation results.",

Despite its appeal, previous robots could only adapt to a limited number of environments. To tackle this problem, we hypothesize that robots will move in various environments by simply implementing a \u201cscaffold-exploitation mechanism\u201d. In our previous work, we drew our inspiration from flatworms, which move over various terrains using their two-dimensional sheet-like body, and designed an autonomous decentralized control scheme for a similar robot, SheetBot. In this study, we extend our previous control scheme so that it can effectively exploit the features in its surrounding environment as scaffolds. The validity of the extended control scheme is confirmed by simulations. Our control scheme is not specific to a certain environment but could be applicable in any environment; it thus forms the basis for developing a multi-terrestrial robot whose working area covers land, sea, and even air.",

        "abstract": "Flexible robot assistants allow reducing the costs of acquisition for the automation of small lot sizes in industrial assembly. To additionally decrease the cost for initial start-up and to reach profitability, new concepts for programming these systems are needed. This work describes an approach for a human-machine-interface that enables operators without expert knowledge to commission complex assembly applications in a short time. The user is efficiently led through the whole process by intuitive operator guidance. To reach the requirements of industrial pick-and-place tasks, a concept for moving the robot by specialized jog controls is presented that allows a fast and user-friendly teaching with high precision. Furthermore, an intuitive approach for selection and parameterization of complex object detection sequences is described. Usability tests with machine setters showed that the human-machine-interface meets industrial needs without requiring expert knowledge and the time for commissioning can be shortened to a few hours.",

Our scene analysis system is able to learn how many speakers are in the scenario, where the speakers are and who is currently speaking. Speakers are unknown in advance. A visual short-term-memory (STM) helps to memorize persons, even if they disappear from the camera's field of view for a while due to movements of persons or the robot head. In comparison to our previous work, we apply more visual features such as height, color and texture features of different upper body parts, to improve the scene representation performance. We show that our system is able to assign words to corresponding speakers. A speaker is recognized again when he leaves and enters the scene, or changes his position even with a newly appearing person.",

We propose to use simplified Markov networks to model the contextual relations between points, where the node potentials are calculated from point-wise classification results using off-the-shelf classifiers, such as Random Forest and Support Vector Machines, and the edge potentials are set by physical distance between points. Our experimental results show that this approach yields comparable if not better results with improved speed compared with state-of-the-art methods. We also propose a novel robust neighborhood filtering method to exclude outliers in the neighborhood of points, in order to reduce noise in local geometric statistics when extracting features and also to reduce number of false edges when constructing Markov networks. We show that applying robust neighborhood filtering improves the results when classifying point clouds with more object categories.",

Rather than pinching these objects between the fingertips of a hand, a miniature hand is embedded recursively on the end of a finger, enabling a power grasp on a smaller scale. The mechanics of designing such a gripper to operate without adding additional tendons are analyzed within the framework of underactuated elastic mechanisms. A simplified robot hand is demonstrated having a recursive gripper, and the process of picking up a pen and writing using a multi-scale grasp is demonstrated.",

A concise derivation of first- and second-order optimality conditions with respect to both mode transition times and parameter values is presented, including cross-derivative terms between the switching times and the parameters. The estimation algorithm is shown to be effective for estimating transition times as well as unknown parameter values from coarsely sampled data for a skid-steered vehicle, which traverses unknown or changing terrain and transitions between discrete dynamic modes. It is shown that second-order optimization methods using the exact Hessian provide far superior convergence, compared to first-or approximate second-order methods, to correct values in simulated and experimental scenarios.",

For this, we extend our earlier works which used Probability Hypothesis Density (PHD) filtering under sensor fusion framework and are among the first to apply this technique to visual odometry in real traffic scenes. We consider features acquired from the camera as a group targets, use the PHD filter to update the overall group state and then estimate the ego-motion vector of the camera. Compared to other approaches, our approach presents a recursive filtering algorithm that provides dynamic estimation of multiple-targets states in the presence of clutter and avoids the association problem. Experimental results show that this method provides good robustness under real traffic scenarios.",

However, such undercarriages are characterized by the occurrence of a number of singular configurations. To avoid these singular configurations most control-approaches restrict the admissible configuration-space thus eventually reducing the mobility and flexibility of the undercarriage. Within this work a state-space representation that forms a locally singularity-free atlas of the admissible configuration-space is presented. Based on this state-space description a switching based controller is developed that incorporates the former singular regions into the used configuration space and thus allows to exploit the full flexibility of non-holonomic, omnidirectional undercarriages. The implemented controller is quantitatively and qualitatively evaluated and compared to one approach that avoids the singular regions and one that completely neglects the non-holonomic bindings.",

In this paper, we introduce a constraint-based six degree-of-freedom (DOF) haptic simulation method incorporating multi-contact friction. We use this method to simulate periodontal operations on typical pathological tissues, including periodontal pocket and two kinds of calculi. A continuous collision detection method based on sphere-trees is proposed to avoid the pop-through phenomenon during tool manipulation against thin objects (such as small sized calculus adhered to the surface of the target tooth). For particle shaped calculus, a friction model is adapted to simulate decreasing frictions during the removal of the calculus. Experiments using a Phantom Premium 3.0 6DOF were carried out to validate the performance of our method. Stable haptic rendering and about 1 kHz update rate was maintained for all the operations, including depth measurement of the periodontal pocket and removal of the invisible block-shaped and particle-shaped calculi.",

        "abstract": "Subtle force feelings caused by contacts at sharp geometric features are necessary to achieve high-fidelity haptic rendering. It is a challenging problem to achieve six degree-of-freedom (6-DOF) haptic simulation with sharp features for multi-region contacts scenario. We propose a configuration-based optimization method using a hybrid sphere-tree model to compute constraint-based collision response. Based on the variance of dihedral angle between adjacent triangles, an original triangle mesh of the simulated object is segmented into a hybrid sphere-tree model, i.e. a hierarchical sphere-tree for global shape and several linear-lists of spheres for local areas with sharp features. In each local area with sharp features, we first identify those spheres which radius is larger than a pre-defined perceptual threshold. Then these spheres are divided into a linear list of smaller spheres by a splitting method. The experiment results on a sphere-cube interaction and a spline-shaped peg-hole interaction validate that the proposed method can simulate a subtle force direction change when sliding contact occurs across the sharp edges. Non-penetration between the two objects can be maintained for multi-region contacts scenario. The haptic rendering rate is over 1kHz and the interaction is stable.",

        "abstract": "Passive velocity field control is advantageous to deliver human-in-the-loop contour tracking rehabilitation exercises, since patients can be allowed to proceed with their preferred pace, while assistance can still be provided as determined by the therapist with ensured coupled stability. We introduce a framework based on passive velocity field control for robot assisted rehabilitation that includes prevention mechanisms against undesired slacking behavior of patients. This framework not only provides systematic approaches to prevent slacking, but also can do so while ensuring coupled stability of the overall robot patient system, a property that cannot be assured with any of the other ad-hoc slacking prevention methods. In particular, the proposed approach enables seamless on-line modification of the task difficulty, speed of contour following, and the level of assistance, while preserving passivity of the system with respect to external forces. The proposed slacking prevention schemes encourage active participation of the patients in rehabilitation protocols with even increased number of repetitions and thanks to flexibility introduced by the controller, render delivery of \u201crepetitive tasks without repeating the same task\u201d possible. Experiments with an haptic interface are included to demonstrate the passivity of the proposed control framework and preliminary human subject experiments with healthy volunteers are presented to validate feasibility and usability of the proposed approaches.",

        "abstract": "Future planetary rovers are expected to probe over steep sandy slopes, such as crater rims, where wheel slippage can be a critical issue. One solution to this issue is to mount redundant actuators on the locomotion mechanisms of the rovers such that they can actively reconfigurate themselves to adapt to the driven terrain. In this study, we propose a mechanical model of a rover based on a wheel-soil contact model combined with the classical terramechanic theory. The effects of the rover reconfiguration on its slippage tendencies are analyzed based on slope traversing experiments and numerical simulations. The validation of the proposed contact model is also discussed based on experimental and numerical simulation results. According to the experimental results, both longitudinal and lateral slippages are greatly reduced by tilting the rover in an uphill direction. The results of the numerical simulation match the experimental results quantitatively, and indicate the possible need to include a slope failure model.",

To improve the success rate of enucleation and increasing the potential viability of the enucleated oocyte, a microfluidic system is specially designed. Magnetically driven MicroTool (MMT) control the flow distribution in the microchamber. Designed microchannel with height difference is for the purpose of confining oocyte with its nucleus located in the withdrawal microchannel to achieve the high precision control in cutting volume. By utilizing these aspects, first, oocytes are sequentially loaded to the operation port; MMT constrains the oocyte location and controls the distribution of micro flow simultaneously letting hydraulic force cut off the nucleus from the oocyte. Enucleated oocyte is smooth in shape and incision is neat. With cutting volume control, this system can achieve high-speed enucleation with less cutting volume while removing the nucleus. Since the flow distribution could be managed by MMT significantly, therefore, the new system is proposed here to show advantages by the means of operation speed, cutting precision and great potentiality on continuous cutting process.",

Our previous control scheme of a snake-like robot, in which the curvature derivative control method is combined with a reflexive mechanism using local pressures on the body wall, could not fully reproduce innate behavior of real snakes. In this study, we improve our previous control scheme. We show that the locomotion of a simulated robot with the improved control scheme is surprisingly in good agreement with the locomotion of a real snake.

We show that humans use body posture and head pose as social signals to initiate and terminate interaction when ordering drinks at a bar. For that, we record and analyze 108 interactions of humans interacting with a human bartender. Based on these findings, we train a Hidden Markov Model (HMM) using automatic body posture and head pose estimation. With this model, the bartender robot of the project JAMES can recognize typical social behaviors of human customers. Evaluation shows a recognition rate of 82.9 % for all implemented social behaviors and in particular a recognition rate of 91.2 % for bartender attention requests, which will allow the robot to interact with multiple humans in a robust and socially appropriate way.",

In this paper we address the problem of socially-aware navigation among people that meets objective criteria such as travel time or path length as well as subjective criteria such as social comfort. Opposed to model-based approaches typically taken in related work, we pose the problem as an unsupervised learning problem. We learn a set of dynamic motion prototypes from observations of relative motion behavior of humans found in publicly available surveillance data sets. The learned motion prototypes are then used to compute dynamic cost maps for path planning using an any-angle A* algorithm. In the evaluation we demonstrate that the learned behaviors are better in reproducing human relative motion in both criteria than a Proxemics-based baseline method.",

        "abstract": "Micromanipulation methods used for complicated tasks such as microrobot assembly and microvascular surgery often lack the force reflection and contact localization capability necessary to achieve robust grasps of micro-scale objects without applying excessive forces. This absence of haptic feedback is especially prohibitive in cases where visual evidence of force application, such as object surface deformation, is imperceptible and where unstructured, dynamically changing environments require force sensing and modulation for safe, atraumatic object manipulation. This paper describes the design, fabrication, and experimental validation of a soft tactile sensor array for sub-millimeter contact localization and contact force measurement during micromanipulation. The geometry and placement of conductive liquid embedded channels within the sensor array are optimized to provide adequate sensitivity for representative micro-manipulation tasks. Mechanical testing of the sensor demonstrates a sensitivity of less than 50mN and contact localization resolution on the order of 100's of microns.",

        "abstract": "Our motivation is to develop a robot that treats auditory information in real environment because auditory information is useful for animated communications or understanding our surroundings. Interactions by using sound information need an aquisition of it and a proper sound source reference between a user and a robot leads to it. Such sound source reference is difficult due to multiple sound sources generating in real environemnt, and we use onomatopoeic representations as a representation for the reference. This paper shows a system that selects a sound source specified by a user from multiple sound sources. Users use onomatopoeias in the specification, and our system separates a mixed sound and converts separated sounds into onomatopoeias for the selection. Onomatopoeais have the ambiguity that each user gives each expression to a certain sound and we create an original similarity based on Minimum Edit Distance and acoustic features for solving its problem. In experiments, our system receives a mixed sound consisting of three sounds and a user's query as inputs, and checks a count of a consistency of a sound source selected by a system and a sound source specified by a user in 100 tests. The result shows.",

Using only this information, motion and observation models of the system are developed such that a particle filter can accurately estimate not only the location of the robot on the surface of the heart, but also the pose of the heart in the world coordinate frame as well as the current physiological phase of the heart. The presented framework is then demonstrated in simulation on a dynamic 3-D model of the human heart and a robot motion model which accurately mimics the behavior of the HeartLander robot.",

        "abstract": "The presented spatial programming system provides an assistance system for online programming of industrial robots. A handheld device and a motion tracking system establish the basis for a modular 3D programming approach corresponding to different phases of robot programming: definition, evaluation and adaption. Static and dynamic gestures enable the program definition of poses, trajectories and tasks. The spatial evaluation is done using an Augmented Reality application on a handheld device. Therefore, the programmer is able to move freely within the robot cell and define the program spatially through gestures. The camera image of the handheld is simultaneously enhanced by virtual objects representing the robot program. Based on 3D motion tracking of human movements and a mobile Augmented Reality application, we introduce a novel kind of interaction for the adaption of robot programs. The programmer is enabled to interact with virtual program components through bare-hand gestures. Such sample forms of interaction include translation and rotation applicable to poses, trajectories or tasks representations. Finally, the program is adapted according to the gestural changes and can be transferred from the handheld device directly to the robot controler.",

This microphone arrangement has 64 microphones arranged in a 350-mm-diameter sphere designed to be mounted on a mobile robot and omni-directional directivity in azimuth and elevation. The performance of the proposed microphone array is verified in different real environments. The experimental results of sound localization demonstrate the effectiveness of the array in challenging environments and the robustness of the proposed microphone array for different pressure sound sources to cover larger areas.",

        "abstract": "Tacit learning is the novel learning scheme based on the principle of biological control to create the appropriate behaviors adapted to the environment. Signal accumulation is the key factor for tacit learning in the process of behavior adaptation. To clarify the role of the signal accumulation in the learning process, we analyzed it dividing into the two processes depending on the control speed. The fast process is used for the behavior control and the slow process is used for the behavior adaptation to the environment. We developed the continuous-time controller for tacit learning with the integrators and showed that the signal accumulation can estimate a part of the robot model through the interactions between the robot body and the environment. This capability of tacit learning is useful to control a plant where the modeling errors and model changes are the critical problems for the stable controls. As the prominent example of the control of such plant, we experimentally verified that tacit learning can create the bipedal walking gait that pushes the ground by the support leg at the moment of losing contact with the ground.",

        "abstract": "This work presents a stable vision based haptic feedback for micromanipulation using both an asynchronous Address Event Representation (AER) silicon retina and a conventional frame-based camera. At this scale, most of the grippers used to manipulate objects lack of force sensing. High frequency vision detection thus provides a sound solution to get information about the position of the object and the tool to provide virtual haptic guides. Artificial retinas present high update rates, which enables to address one of the major challenge of haptic feedback teleoperation systems, namely stability. However static objects are not detected. The haptic feedback is thus based on an asynchronous silicon retina to provide a high update rate of moving objects and a frame-based camera to retrieve the position of the target object. This approach is validated by pick-and-place of microspheres (diameter: around 50 micrometers) using a piezoelectric microgripper. The displacement of the tool, as well as the opening and closing of the gripper are controlled by the haptic device. Haptic virtual guides are transmitted to users to assist them in the different steps of the pick-and-place task: a virtual stiffness ensures the correct alignment of the tool with respect to the object, a repulsive haptic force enables users to monitor the gripping step, and operators are assisted while picking and placing the object.",

        "abstract": "On challenging, uneven terrain a legged robot's open loop posture will almost inevitably be inefficient, due to uncoordinated support of gravitational loads with coupled internal torques. By reasoning about certain structural properties governing the infinitesimal kinematics of the closed chains arising from a typical stance, we have developed a computationally trivial self-manipulation behavior that can minimize both internal and external torques absent any terrain information. The key to this behavior is a change of basis in torque space that approximates the partially decoupled nature of the two types of disturbances. The new coordinates reveal how to use actuator current measurements as proprioceptive sensors for the approximate gradients of both the internal and external task potential fields, without recourse to further modeling. The behavior is derived using a manipulation framework informed by the dual relationship between a legged robot and a multifingered hand. We implement the reactive posture controller resulting from simple online descent along these proprioceptively sensed gradients on the X-RHex robot to document the significant savings in standing power.",

        "abstract": "System state estimation is an essential part for robot navigation and control. A combination of Inertial Navigation Systems (INS) and further exteroceptive sensors such as cameras or laser scanners is widely used. On small robotic systems with limitations in payload, power consumption and computational resources the processing of exteroceptive sensor data often introduces time delays which have to be considered in the sensor data fusion process. These time delays are especially critical in the estimation of system velocity. In this paper we present a state estimation framework fusing an INS with time delayed, relative exteroceptive sensor measurements. We evaluate its performance for a highly dynamic flight system trajectory including a flip. The evolution of velocity and position errors for varying measurement frequencies from 15Hz to 1Hz and time delays up to 1s is shown in Monte Carlo simulations. The filter algorithm with key frame based odometry permits an optimal, local drift free navigation while still being computationally tractable on small onboard computers. Finally, we present the results of the algorithm applied to a real quadrotor by flying from inside a house out through the window.",

The first design uses Linear Inverted Pendulum Model (LIPM) dynamics, and the other design uses a more complete Planar dynamics. The filter based on the simpler LIPM design is more robust to modeling error. The more complex design estimates center of mass height and joint velocities, and tracks horizontal center of mass translation more accurately. We also investigate different ways of handling contact states and using force sensing in state estimation. In the LIPM filter, force sensing is used to determine contact states and tune filter parameters. In the Planar filter, force sensing is used to select the proper measurement equation.",

The chosen mathematical framework clarifies the role of joint compliance and its effect on the manipulator performance.

The design concept combines the strengths of both underwater gliders and robotic fish, featuring long operation duration and high maneuverability. This paper presents both analytical and experimental results for the three-dimension spiraling motion, an essential working pattern of the gliding fish for detecting pollution in a water column. A dynamic model of the gliding robotic fish with actuated tail is established. Then the steady-state spiraling equations are derived and solved recursively using Newton's method. The gliding fish prototype is tested in experiments. Both model prediction and experimental results show that the spiraling motion has very low energy consumption, and the gliding fish can achieve high maneuverability with a turning radius less than 1 m, 2.5% of the reported turning radius of a typical underwater glider.",

The proposed approach is not related to the position-based nor image-based categories as the state vectors are built from the two-view affine geometry and the visual measurements. The Pl\u00fccker coordinates are used to model many types of visual features like 3-D lines but also point pairs in the same framework. With such a representation, a SVS is carried out with a very few number of features, provided the Fundamental matrix and the infinite homography are both available. This choice is also motivated so as to better reject outliers, to ensure the epipolar constraint and to provide efficient decoupled rotational and translational kinematic control laws with closed-form interaction matrices. Several tasks functions have been designed with low-dimensional error vectors which make the proof of stability and convergence study possible.",

        "abstract": "The paper focuses on the stiffness modeling of parallel manipulators composed of non-perfect serial chains, whose geometrical parameters differ from the nominal ones. In these manipulators, there usually exist essential internal forces/torques that considerably affect the stiffness properties and also change the end-effector location. These internal loadings are caused by elastic deformations of the manipulator elements during assembling, while the geometrical errors in the chains are compensated for by applying appropriate forces. For this type of manipulators, a non-linear stiffness modeling technique is proposed that allows us to take into account inaccuracy in the chains and to aggregate their stiffness models for the case of both small and large deflections. Advantages of the developed technique and its ability to compute and compensate for the compliance errors caused by different factors are illustrated by an example that deals with parallel manipulators of the Orthoglide family.",

Our new method estimates the collision probability and also the Time-To-Collision (TTC) probability distribution for more robust and real-time decision making.

        "abstract": "Object surface properties are among the most important information which a robot requires in order to effectively interact with an unknown environment. This paper presents a novel haptic exploration strategy for recognizing the physical properties of unknown object surfaces using an intelligent finger. This developed intelligent finger is capable of identifying the contact location, normal and tangential force, and the vibrations generated from the contact in real time. In the proposed strategy, this finger gently slides along the surface with a short stroke while increasing and decreasing the sliding velocity. By applying a dynamic friction model to describe this contact, rich and accurate surface physical properties can be identified within this stroke. This allows different surface materials to be easily distinguished even if when they have very similar texture. Several supervised learning algorithms have been applied and compared for surface recognition based on the obtained surface properties. It has been found that the na\u00efve Bayes classifier is superior to radial basis function network and k-NN method, achieving an overall classification accuracy of 88.5% for distinguishing twelve different surface materials.",

        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "There is increasing interest in the use of Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (AUVs) to substantially improve the means available for ocean exploration and exploitation. A key element in the operation of certain classes of AUVs is the availability of good underwater positioning systems to localize one or more vehicles simultaneously based on information received on-board a support ship or a set of autonomous surface vehicles. In an interesting operational scenario, the set of autonomous surface vehicles carries a network of acoustic units that measure the elevation and azimuth angles between the target and each of the receivers. Motivated by these considerations, in this paper we address the problem of determining the optimal geometric configuration of an acoustic sensor network at the ocean surface that will maximize the angle-related information available for underwater target positioning. It is assumed that the angle measurements are corrupted by white Gaussian noise, the variance of which is distance-dependent. Using the Cramer-Rao lower bound inequality, the trace of the inverse of the Fisher Information matrix (also called the Cramer-Rao Bound matrix) for the problem at hand is used to determine the sensor configuration that yields the minimum possible covariance of any unbiased target estimator. It is shown that the optimal configuration lends itself to an interesting geometrical interpretation and that the spreading of the sensor configuration depends explicitly on the intensity of the measurement noise and the target depth. Simulation examples illustrate the key results derived.",

Each actuator consists of a piezoelectric actuator and hydraulic displacement amplification mechanism (HDAM) that encapsulates incompressible liquid in a micro-chamber with two flexible polymer membranes. In prior work, we experimentally applied the actuator arrays to an efficient vibrational Braille code display. In this paper, we investigated the artificial tactile feeling projected onto the fingertip in contact with the display while the actuation pattern was controlled both temporally and spatially. The arrays could successfully display two relative tactile feelings, \u201crough\u201d and \u201csmooth\u201d, distinctly when the vibrational frequency of the individual actuator and switching time of the lines of actuators were controlled. In addition, we found that pseudo tactile sensation appeared between the adjacent cells of the display while the two actuators were controlled to have identical vibrating frequencies. We experimentally deduced the conditions when the pseudo tactile sensation was generated and the \u201ceffective\u201d resolution of the display was augmented. Pseudo tactile sensation would enable the display to transfer more variable tactile sensation and thus, information to the finger.",

        "abstract": "Current SLAM back-ends are based on least squares optimization and thus are not robust against outliers like data association errors and false positive loop closure detections. Our paper presents and evaluates a robust back-end formulation for SLAM using switchable constraints. Instead of proposing yet another appearance-based data association technique, our system is able to recognize and reject outliers during the optimization. This is achieved by making the topology of the underlying factor graph representation subject to the optimization instead of keeping it fixed. The evaluation shows that the approach can deal with up to 1000 false positive loop closure constraints on various datasets. This largely increases the robustness of the overall SLAM system and closes a gap between the sensor-driven front-end and the back-end optimizers.",

        "abstract": "Image-based visual servoing (IBVS) is now recognized to be an efficient and robust control strategy to guide robots using only visual data. Classical IBVS is commonly based on the Cartesian coordinates of points in the image. Although the convergence of the visual features to the desired ones is generally achieved, classical IBVS can lead to unnecessary displacements of the camera, such as the camera retreat problem in the case of a pure rotation around the optical axis. In contrast, IBVS based on the polar coordinates of points, is well adapted to carry out rotations around the optical axis but less adapted to manage translations. To take advantage of the benefits of each approach, we propose a new strategy for visual servoing based on a switching controller. The controller switches between Cartesian-based and polar-based approaches thanks to a switching signal provided by a decision maker. With the proposed controller, unnecessary 3D displacements are minimized without any 3D reconstruction and visibility constraints can be taken into account. The local stability of the closed-loop switching system is proved. A comparison with classical controllers and advanced controllers is performed by simulations. This comparative study illustrates the effectiveness of the proposed controller in terms of displacement in the image space and in the 3D space.",

In particular, we propose a switching-based state mapping and control algorithm between a rate-based passive controller, which addresses the workspace incompatibility between the master and slave systems, and a pose-based passive controller, which is required for precise operation. The overall control architecture provides the possibility of changing the scaling factor of the mapping online, while preserving the passivity of the complete system. In our formulation, we use the port-Hamiltonian framework, in which energetic considerations play a determinant role for passivity and, thereby stability of the overall system.

Consequently, robots must share their physical and social space with human beings. How can robots select a partner among many interactants and how can they focus their attention on regions of interest? As psychologists consider synchrony as an important parameter for social interaction, we hypothesize that in the case of social interaction, people focus their attention on regions of interest where the visual stimuli are synchronized with their inner dynamics. Then, we assume that a mechanism able to detect synchrony between internal dynamics of a robot and external visual stimuli (optical flow) can be used as a starting point for human robot interaction. This kind of mechanism can also be involved in more complex tasks of interaction such as partner selection. Inspired by human psychological and neurobiological data, we propose a synchrony-based neural network architecture capable of selecting the robot partner and of locating focus of attention.",

This problem becomes particularly relevant when limits on the production costs of sensing gloves are taken into account. These cost constraints may limit both the number and the quality of sensors used as well as the technology adopted. For this reason, an optimal distribution of sensors on the glove during the design phase is mandatory in order to obtain good hand pose reconstruction. In this paper, by exploiting the knowledge on how humans most frequently use their hands in grasping tasks, we study the problem of how and where to place sensors on the glove in order to get the maximum information about the actual hand posture, and hence minimize in average the reconstruction error. Simulations and experiments of reconstruction performance are reported to validate the proposed optimal design of sensing devices.",

        "abstract": "Intelligent Pneumatic Actuators (IPA) is a new generation of actuator for Research and Development (R&D). The purpose of this paper is to present the System Identification (SI) technique and procedure for the IPA system. System identification is used to obtain the mathematical model (transfer function) of the IPA system from the measured experimental data. Flow for the SI procedure starts with experimental setup, model structure selection, model estimation, model validation and finally testing with basic controller to prove the operation of IPA system. Auto Regressive with Exogenous Input (ARX) model is chosen as model structure of the system. Based on the input and output data of the system (model validation), best fit criterion and correlation analysis of the residual is analyzed to determine the adequate model to represent the IPA system. The result from SI model shows linear discrete model in order to obtain a discrete transfer function for the IPA system.",

The MIT Cheetah robot's tail rejects an impulsive disturbance from a \u2018wrecking ball\u2019 in experiments. This study demonstrates that a tail will help the MIT Cheetah achieve its goal of 30mph locomotion by 2014.",

The agent only knows its own position with respect to its initial frame, and the bearing angle of the target in that frame. It is assumed that the position of the target is unknown. An estimator and a controller are proposed to estimate the position of the target and make the agent move on a circular trajectory with a desired radius around it. The performance of the proposed algorithm is verified both through simulations and experiments. Robustness is also established in the face of noise and target motion.",

Our objective is to create a robot design on a patient-specific and surgery-specific basis to enable the robot to reach multiple clinically relevant sites while avoiding anatomical obstacles. Our method uses a mechanically accurate model of concentric tube robot kinematics that considers a robot's time-varying shape throughout the performance of a task. Our method combines a search over a robot's design space with sampling-based motion planning over its configuration space to compute a design under which the robot can feasibly perform a specified task without damaging surrounding tissues. To accelerate the algorithm, we leverage design coherence, the observation that collision-free configuration spaces of robots of similar designs are similar. If a solution exists, our method is guaranteed, as time is allowed to increase, to find a design and corresponding feasible motion plan. We provide examples illustrating the importance of using mechanically accurate models during design and motion planning and demonstrating our method's effectiveness in a medically motivated simulated scenario involving navigation through the lung.",

This problem is novel because the self-motion of the redundant robot can be utilized to achieve secondary control objectives while allowing the user to concentrate on controlling only the tip of the slave system. To that end, feedback linearizing controllers are proposed for both the master and slave systems, whose effectiveness is demonstrated using numerical simulations for the case of singularity avoidance as a subtask.",

Recently, Linear Temporal Logic synthesis has been used to construct robot controllers for performing high-level tasks. During continuous execution of these controllers by a physical robot, one or more low-level controllers are invoked simultaneously. If these low-level behaviors take different lengths of time to complete, the system will pass through several potentially unsafe intermediate states. This paper presents an algorithm that either generates a hybrid controller such that every continuous behavior of the robot is safe, or determines at synthesis time that the behavior may be unsafe. The proposed approach is implemented within the LTLMoP toolkit for reactive mission planning.",

        "track": "main",
        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "The amphibious robot is so attractive and challenging for its broad application and its complex working environment. It should walk on rough ground, maneuver underwater and pass through transitional terrain such as sand and mud, simultaneously. To tackle with such a complex task, a novel amphibious robot (AmphiHex-I) with transformable leg-flipper composite propulsion is proposed and developed. This paper presents the detailed structure design of the transformable leg-flipper propulsion mechanism and its drive module, which enables the amphibious robot passing through the terrain, water and transitional zone between them. A preliminary theoretical analysis is conducted to study the interaction between the elliptic leg and transitional environment such as granular medium. An orthogonal experiment is designed to study the leg locomotion in the sandy and muddy terrain with different water content. Finally, basic propulsion experiments of AmphiHex-I are launched, which verified the locomotion capability on land and underwater is achieved by the transformable leg-flipper mechanism.",

Momentum wheels mounted on three faces of the cube (Fig. 1) rotate at high angular velocities and then brake suddenly, causing the Cubli to jump up. Once the Cubli has almost reached the corner stand-up position, controlled motor torques are applied to make it balance on its corner. This paper tracks the development of the Cubli's one dimensional prototype at ETH Zurich and presents preliminary results",

        "abstract": "The Milli-Motein (Millimeter-Scale Motorized Protein) is ca chain of programmable matter with a 1 cm pitch. It can fold itself into digitized approximations of arbitrary three-dimensional shapes. The small size of the Milli-Motein segments is enabled by the use of our new electropermanent wobble stepper motors, described in this paper, and by a highly integrated electronic and mechanical design. The chain is an interlocked series of connected motor rotors and stators, wrapped with a continuous flex circuit to provide communications, control, and power transmission capabilities. The Milli-Motein uses off-the-shelf electronic components and fasteners, and custom parts fabricated by conventional and electric discharge machining, assembled with screws, glue, and solder using tweezers under a microscope. We perform shape reconfiguration experiments using a four-segment Milli-Motein. It can switch from a straight line to a prescribed shape in 5 seconds, consuming 2.6 W power during reconfiguration. It can hold its shape indefinitely without power. During reconfiguration, a segment can lift the weight of one but not two segments as a horizontal cantilever.",

        "abstract": "This paper presents a new university course combining theoretical lectures with a robot competition. The main intention is to offer a practical course including hands-on experiences being close to current research topics in the field of mobile robotics. For this purpose, a commercial mobile robot is equipped with state of the art sensors, allowing autonomous execution of manipulation tasks. The course consists of three thematical sections. At the beginning of each, lectures provide the theoretical background. On this basis, the participants are addressed to develop algorithms and to solve specific tasks, delivered in homework packages, self-reliantly or in a team. Finally, the developed software components need to be merged to solve a predefined scenario, e.g. autonomous part handling. At the end of a thematic section, students demonstrate their developed solutions within a challenge and explain their approaches in a presentation. Starting with teleoperation and object recognition, the RobotChallenge ends up with navigation in unknown terrain. Besides others, the participants acquire soft-skills, such as project and team management. Being carried out for the first time in winter term 2011/2012, the RobotChallenge successfully promotes profound understanding of mobile robotics that is applied during practical experiences. It turns out, that aspiring to win competions lead to a high motivation of the students w.r.t. development of appropriate solutions.",

Mechanical self-aligning geometry features for docking faces of modular reconfigurable robot systems can be varied to improve the reliability of connection systems. This paper presents a new two-layer mating face design for robots that are constrained to move in a plane. It has a provably larger area of acceptance than any to date. We present an analysis of both position and orientation misalignments with simulated results over a two parameter design space comparing this connector with two other best-in-class shapes. The results show an average acceptance area increase approximately 88% over gendered mating faces and approximately 138% over non-gendered mating faces.",

The proposed approach is generic, parameter-free, model-free, robust, computationally efficient, and applicable for real-time use during walking. It can detect early indications of instability that could lead to a fall of the robot. Three real-world experiments are presented: with a compliant bipedal robot, with a stiff humanoid robot, and with a human subject.",

        "abstract": "Virtual holonomic output constraints define a set in the output space of a robot to which the end-effector should be confined. We propose the use of set stabilization for implementing virtual constraints, conducting analyses and experimental comparisons between existing control schemes and a set stabilization controller to justify our choice. The existing methods combine geometric projections and PD control, which ignores the higher-order properties of the constraint like curvature. The set stabilization method inherently incorporates constraint curvature information, allowing it to decouple the dynamics towards and along the set. It is shown that the two methods are equivalent on a line constraint, but that only the set stabilization method simultaneously guarantees asymptotic stability on a circle.",

        "abstract": "On a passive dynamic walker, we find that an appropriate spring placed on the mass center of two legs can greatly improve the walker's walking performance, which includes its walking speed, disturbance rejection ability and step length. However, the extent to which spring influences these properties is unknown and how to choose an appropriate spring stiffness to achieve optimal walking performance still needs to be discussed. In this paper, we present a study on the effect of spring on these properties by constructing a synthesize index P to assess the walking performance. Through numerical simulation on three models, we find the walker with spring has a better walking performance over a pure passive dynamic walker and the extension spring on the mass center of two legs can improve a walker's overall walking performance much better.",

However, integration of homing algorithms into real applications is not widely studied and poses a number of significant challenges. Failures often occur due to moving people within the scene and variations in illumination. We present a novel integrated indoor topological navigation framework, which combines odometry motion with visual homing algorithms. We show robustness to scene variation and real-time performance through a series of tests conducted in four real apartments and several typical indoor scenes, including doorways, offices etc.",

Appropriate intrinsic and / or functional safety design must be employed for collaborative robots in order to reduce the human injury risks through physical human-robot interaction. Above all the situations that such interactions are possible to occur, it is reported that clamping humans with robot and its environment is of great danger in a sense of human injury risks. We have conducted experiments and simulations that mimic clamping-human accident in some different situations varying robot's inertia, velocity, thickness of robot's soft cover and joint stiffness. Furthermore, some collision detection and reaction measures are implemented on the experimental system and their contributions to human safety were evaluated. From the results of these experiments and simulations, the joint stiffness was found to play an important role on human safety considerably affecting the performance of collision reaction.",

        "abstract": "Recently, compliance has been considered as one of the key physical properties that a robot should incorporate to be able to physically interact with humans and uncertain environments. Apart from the improved ability of interaction, mechanical robustness and higher safety-related performances, compliance introduces underdamped oscillatory modes and reduces the mechanical natural frequency of the plant to be controlled making its control much more complex than that of conventional stiff actuators. To overcome these drawbacks, some recent works focus on the incorporation of physical damping within compliant actuators. This work presents an analysis for the quantitative evaluation of the effects of physical damping in compliant robotic joints to demonstrate the improvements (dynamic performance, stability, controllability, tracking precision and energy efficiency) which can be gained by incorporating physical damping in such flexible transmission systems. Simulation and experimental results validate that these benefits can effectively be achieved on an existing compliant actuator prototype with variable physical damping.",

The derivation of the optimal solution consists of two steps that are the speeding up of supporting legs and that of swinging legs. The way of the speeding up of swinging legs is very similar to that of a two link manipulator developed by Bobrow. In this paper, first, a method of using torque redundancy of the robot is proposed for speeding up of supporting legs with the constraints due to ZMP, the power limits of joint actuators and the limits of available friction forces. Then, an algorithm for obtaining the fastest walking pattern in a trot gait period is developed by combining the result of the supporting legs and that of the swinging legs. The obtained walking pattern is installed in a quadruped robot SONY ERS-7 and its effectiveness is verified by experiments.",

        "abstract": "In comparison to industrial settings with structured environments, the operation of autonomous robots in unstructured and uncertain environments is more challenging. This video presents a generic control and system architecture ARCADE, applicable for real-time robot control in complex task situations. Several methods to cope with uncertainties are demonstrated with the example task of changing tires on a car. Approaches of object detection (applied to car, tires, and humans), robust real-time control of robot arms under perception uncertainty, and human-friendly haptic interaction are detailed. The video shows two robots jointly performing the task of mounting a mock-up tire to a real car using the proposed methods, realizing robust performance in an uncertain environment.",

Either for indoor or outdoor environments, segmentation into topological places is a challenging issue. In this paper, we propose a common approach for indoor and outdoor environment segmentation without elaborating a complete topological navigation system. The approach is novel in that environment sensing is performed using spherical images. Environment structure estimation is performed by a global structure descriptor specially adapted to the spherical representation. This descriptor is processed by a custom designed algorithm which detects change-points defining the segmentation between topological places.",

        "abstract": "Legged locomotion is one of the most versatile forms of mobility. However, despite the importance of legged locomotion and the large number of legged robotics studies, no biped or quadruped matches the agility and versatility of their biological counterparts to date. Approaches to designing controllers for legged locomotion systems are often based on either the assumption of perfectly known dynamics or mechanical designs that substantially reduce the dimensionality of the problem. The few existing approaches for learning controllers for legged systems either require exhaustive real-world data or they improve controllers only conservatively, leading to slow learning. We present a data-efficient approach to learning feedback controllers for legged locomotive systems, based on learned probabilistic forward models for generating walking policies. On a compass walker, we show that our approach allows for learning gait policies from very little data. Moreover, we analyze learned locomotion models of a biomechanically inspired biped. Our approach has the potential to scale to high-dimensional humanoid robots with little loss in efficiency.",

        "abstract": "A legged system that can negotiate moderately uneven terrain without human intervention or a vision-based control system can allow those resources, if available, to be concentrated on high-level tasks. This paper presents results of preliminary research on the application of a Force Threshold-based Position (FTP) Controller on an upright quadruped system blindly walking on irregular terrain. The algorithm requires no interleg communication, such as needed for a multi-leg Jacobian, or inertial sensing of the body. Instead, each leg relies upon local feedback and simple time triggers for gait phasing. Results are shown for sagittal plane implementation in a dynamics-based simulator, while an experimental system is being designed for further testing. Concurrent research applies the FTP controller to a sprawled-leg hexapod system in hopes of extracting general leg control principles for innate stability over moderate terrain.",

Force feedback in the form of threshold comparison is used to control each leg independently. The FTP controller decouples the control of individual legs and uses only localized feedback to generate joint torques. No feedback of body state is needed and no multi-leg Jacobian is computed. Preliminary results suggest that the FTP controller is robust to terrain elevations without extracting any information about the ground or inertial sensing of the body. The algorithm is applied to a simulated hexapod walking blindly on irregular terrain, and an experimental system has been built. The controller has also been applied and tested on different gaits without modification. The FTP controller also has potential for expansion to bipeds, quadrupeds and other biologically-inspired forms.",

        "abstract": "This paper reports a novel mutual information (MI) based algorithm for automatic registration of unstructured 3D point clouds comprised of co-registered 3D lidar and camera imagery. The proposed method provides a robust and principled framework for fusing the complementary information obtained from these two different sensing modalities. High-dimensional features are extracted from a training set of textured point clouds (scans) and hierarchical k-means clustering is used to quantize these features into a set of codewords. Using this codebook, any new scan can be represented as a collection of codewords. Under the correct rigid-body transformation aligning two overlapping scans, the MI between the codewords present in the scans is maximized. We apply a James-Stein-type shrinkage estimator to estimate the true MI from the marginal and joint histograms of the codewords extracted from the scans. Experimental results using scans obtained by a vehicle equipped with a 3D laser scanner and an omnidirectional camera are used to validate the robustness of the proposed algorithm over a wide range of initial conditions. We also show that the proposed method works well with 3D data alone.",

To configure a sensing skin shaped by arbitrary cuts and rapid changes in designs, we use a wavefront planning approach to generate a minimum-depth spanning tree of an arbitrary topology of contiguous, regularly arranged modular sensing units on a flexible substrate wired network. A Finite State Machine protocol for extracting this topology and sensor information is shown that is robust to destructive sensor loss, device failure, and transmission noise. The architecture is designed to require as little state complexity at each node as possible to minimize the area and cost of such a network implemented in printable semiconductor technology. Simulation data show recovery from network failures and extension of the architecture to larger networks with arbitrary geometry, and a sample synthesis of the verified architecture logic is shown to have a very low state and combinational logic complexity. A proof-of-concept implementation of the architecture using microcontrollers and optical proximity sensors on a flexible substrate show integration with a Scaled Composite Manufacturing process used for Biomimetic Millirobots.",

These are carefully addressed and applied on a simulated binaural database. Cues are evaluated in azimuth estimation and their discriminatory effectiveness is studied as a function of the reverberation time with statistical data analysis techniques. Results show that big differences exist between the discriminatory abilities of multiple types of cue extraction methods. Thus a careful cue selection must be performed before establishing a sound localization system.",

        "abstract": "Future autonomous service robots are intended to operate in open and complex environments. This in turn implies complications ensuring safe operation. The tenor of few available investigations is the need for dynamically assessing operational risks. Furthermore, a new kind of hazards being implicated by the robot's capability to manipulate the environment occurs: hazardous environmental object interactions. One of the open questions in safety research is integrating safety knowledge into robotic systems, enabling these systems behaving safety-conscious in hazardous situations. In this paper a safety procedure is described, in which learning of safety knowledge from human demonstration is considered. Within the procedure, a task is demonstrated to the robot, which observes object-to-object relations and labels situational data as commanded by the human. Based on this data, several supervised learning techniques are evaluated used for finally extracting safety knowledge. Results indicate that Decision Trees allow interesting opportunities.",

        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "To achieve dynamic balancing and natural walking for a bipedal robot we propose a novel force-based control framework. Given 6-dimensional pose vector representing robot's posture and attitude, desired force and moment in the task space are computed. To generate the force and moment as desired, we propose the use of virtual gravity compensation (VGC), essentially a dynamic controller that outputs joint torques. By using the VGC-based balancing controller, the robot can maintain a desired pose stably even on a tilting plate. We also propose to extend the VGC-based balancing controller to implement a walking algorithm that controls the desired pose in terms of capture point using a finite state machine. The control algorithm was tested with torque-controlled humanoid platforms developed by our group to demonstrate robust and natural gaits under various walking environments. The robot walked robustly on irregular surfaces and recovered from external pushes. The robot also exhibited natural walking motions such as pendulum-like leg swings and heel-to-toe transitions, a characteristic feature of human gait, all without explicitly designating joint angle trajectories.",

        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "The challenge of persistent appearance-based navigation and mapping is to develop an autonomous robotic vision system that can simultaneously localize, map and navigate over the lifetime of the robot. However, the computation time and memory requirements of current appearance-based methods typically scale not only with the size of the environment but also with the operation time of the platform; also, repeated revisits to locations will develop multiple competing representations which reduce recall performance. In this paper we present a solution to the persistent localization, mapping and global path planning problem in the context of a delivery robot in an office environment over a one-week period. Using a graphical appearance-based SLAM algorithm, CAT-Graph, we demonstrate constant time and memory loop closure detection with minimal degradation during repeated revisits to locations, along with topological path planning that improves over time without using a global metric representation. We compare the localization performance of CAT-Graph to openFABMAP, an appearance-only SLAM algorithm, and the path planning performance to occupancy-grid based metric SLAM. We discuss the limitations of the algorithm with regard to environment change over time and illustrate how the topological graph representation can be coupled with local movement behaviors for persistent autonomous robot navigation.",

In Chinese calligraphy these strokes are combined into a full character in a fluid way. Therefore Chinese calligraphy provides an interesting problem to study learning mechanisms such as how to automatically construct complex tasks (full characters) from previously learned simpler ones (single strokes) (Fig. 1). The goal of this project is that a robot should be able to decide which previously learned strokes or characters to use for drawing a newly presented character and to improve its drawing over several iterations.",

        "abstract": "SRS is a European research project for building robust personal assistant robots using ROS (Robotic Operating System) and Care-O-bot (COB) 3 as the initial demonstration platform. In this paper, experience gained while building the SRS system is presented. A main contribution of the paper is the SRS autonomous control framework. The framework is divided into two parts. First, it has an automatic task planner, which initialises actions on the symbolic level. The planner produces proactive robotic behaviours based on updated semantic knowledge. Second, it has an action executive for coordination actions at the level of sensing and actuation. The executive produces reactive behaviours in well-defined domains. The two parts are integrated by fuzzy logic based symbolic grounding. As a whole, they represent the framework for autonomous control. Based on the framework, several new components and user interfaces are integrated on top of COB's existing capabilities to enable robust fetch and carry in unstructured environments. The implementation strategy and results are discussed at the end of the paper.",

        "abstract": "Self-localization of ground vehicles in densely populated urban environments poses a significant challenge. The presence of tall buildings in close proximity to traversable areas limits the use of GPS-based positioning techniques in such environments. This paper presents an approach to global localization on a hybrid metric-topological map using a monocular camera and wheel odometry. The global topology is built upon spatially separated reference places represented by local image features. In contrast to other approaches we employ a feature selection scheme ensuring a more discriminative representation of reference places while simultaneously rejecting a multitude of features caused by dynamic objects. Through fusion with additional local cues the reference places are assigned discrete map positions allowing metric localization within the map. The self-localization is carried out by associating observed visual features with those stored for each reference place. Comprehensive experiments in a dense urban environment covering a time difference of about 9 months are carried out. This demonstrates the robustness of our approach in environments subjected to high dynamic and environmental changes.",

        "abstract": "In the context of autonomous rendezvous and space debris removal, visual model-based tracking can be particularly suited. Some classical methods achieve the tracking by relying on the alignment of projected lines of the 3D model with edges detected in the image. However, processing complete 3D models of complex objects, of any shape, presents several limitations, and is not always suitable for real-time applications. This paper proposes an approach to avoid these shortcomings. It takes advantage of GPU acceleration and 3D rendering. From the rendered model, visible edges are extracted, from both depth and texture discontinuities. Correspondences with image edges are found thanks to a 1D search along the edge normals. Our approach addresses the pose estimation task as the full scale nonlinear minimization of a distance to a line. A multiple hypothesis solution is also proposed, improving tracking robustness. Our method has been evaluated on both synthetic images (provided with ground truth) and real images.",

Using a hierarchical approach, the descriptor is able to capture both local and global features of the trajectory. The algorithm iteratively splits up every trajectory into smaller trajectory segments resulting in a binary tree. Inspired by the Frenet-Serret formulas, a projection onto a lower dimensional subspace is performed for every trajectory segment, providing a characteristic description of every trajectory. The subspace projection acts as a pseudo-curvature measure in every dimension. Successful applicability is shown through classification experiments in three and six dimensions using an RGB-D camera. For comparison with other algorithms, the Australian Sign Language dataset is also used for classification, showing a superior classification rate.",

Trajectories of moving objects often contain repeated patterns of motion, and learning those patterns can yield interception paths that succeed more often. We therefore propose an original trajectory clustering algorithm for extracting motion patterns from trajectory data and demonstrate its effectiveness over the more common clustering approach of using k-means. We use the results to build a Hidden Markov Model of a target's motion and predict movement. Our simulations show that these predictions lead to more effective interception. The results of this work have potential applications in coordination of multi-robot systems, tracking and surveillance tasks, and dynamic obstacle avoidance.",

We focus on the control of forward straight walking and the roughness, such as changes in level and inclination, along the walking direction is explicitly considered herein. The requirements for designing the walking parameters, such as the step length and the step cycle for continuous walking, are discussed based on assumptions on the roughness of the terrain. An online adaptation strategy that includes change in stepping length, step cycle, and landing edge is discussed. The adaptation strategy uses the actual center of mass motion and the contact status to the ground for changing the stepping length, the step cycle, and the landing edge. We extended a walking pattern generation method that can handle the permissible region of the ZMP for balance recovery to a version that can also simultaneously handle changes in stepping position if needed. This method is used in the abovementioned discussions. A compensation method for the effect of the multibody system is also presented, so that these discussions can be made applicable to the actual humanoid system.",

        "abstract": "This paper presents an algorithm for direct trajectory optimization in domains with contact. Since contacts and other unilateral constraints may introduce non-smooth dynamics, many standard algorithms of optimal control and reinforcement learning cannot be directly applied to such domains. We use a smooth contact model that can compute inverse dynamics through the contact, thereby avoiding hybrid representation of the non-smooth contact state. This allows us to formulate an unconstrained, continuous trajectory optimization problem, which can be solved using standard optimization tools. We demonstrate our approach by optimizing a running gait for a 31-dimensional simulated humanoid. The resulting gait is demonstrated in a movie attached as supplementary material. The optimization result exhibits a synchronous motion of the arm and the opposite leg, eliminating undesired angular momentum; this is a key feature of bipedal running, and its emergence attests to the power of the optimization process.",

This transfer is intended to preserve the functionality of a grasp constructed for one of the objects, thus enabling the analogous action to be performed on a novel object for which no grasp has been specified. Manipulation knowledge is hence generalized from a single example to a class of objects with a significant amount of shape variability. The transfer is achieved through warping the surface geometry of the source object onto the target object, and along with it the contact points of a grasp. The warped contacts are locally replanned, if necessary, to ensure grasp stability, and a suitable grasp pose is computed. We present extensive results of experiments with a database of four-finger grasps, designed to systematically cover variations on grasping the mugs of the Princeton Shape Benchmark.",

While the iCub moves it observes the object, and a neural network then learns how to relate its pose and visual inputs to the object location. We show that satisfactory results can be obtained for localisation even in scenarios where the kinematic model is imprecise or not available. Furthermore, we demonstrate that this task can be accomplished safely.

        "abstract": "This paper is concerned with realization of a new kind of three-legged walking machine. The proposed robot has neither coxa joint nor knee joint, so the three legs are just rigidly fixed to each other. Instead of pursuing elaborated joint mechanism for the coxa, we equipped it with two actuators and a pair of weights, so that it can generate torque about the yaw and the pitch axes. Thus it only rocks as a reaction of the mass driving unit. We show that, by appropriate choices of oscillatory controls (i.e., amplitudes, frequencies and phases of the pitch and the yaw actuators), it is indeed possible to achieve rotation and forwarding locomotion of the tripedal robot. In particular, combination of the frequencies selects the rotation/forwarding, while combination of the phases affects the direction of forwarding. We also remark that the realized motion naturally reflects the symmetry of the body structure.",

From an analysis of the problems encountered with the conventional ASC during applications to practical disaster environments, we propose a new tube-type ASC with enhanced mobility and practical functionality for rescue activities. We designed a smart structure to mount vibration motors on a long tubular cable without any rigid projections. A suitable tubular cable material was also selected experimentally to propagate the vibration efficiently. We integrated several practical functions such as a head bending structure, an auditory communication system, and a gravity indicator for the head orientation. We conducted several fundamental performance experiments. Finally, the enhanced performance of the tube-type ASC for practical use was demonstrated at a training site for first responders.",

        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "This paper presents an algorithm for planning sequences of pushes, by which a robotic arm equipped with a single rigid finger can move a manipulated object (or manipulandum) towards a desired goal pose. Pushing is perhaps the most basic kind of manipulation, however it presents difficult challenges for planning, because of the complex relationship between manipulative pushing actions and resulting manipulandum motions. The motion planning literature has well developed paradigms for solving e.g. the piano-mover's problem, where the search occurs directly in the configuration space of the manipulandum object being moved. In contrast, in pushing manipulation, a plan must be built in the action space of the robot, which is only indirectly linked to the motion space of the manipulandum through a complex interaction for which inverse models may not be known. In this paper, we present a two stage approach to planning pushing operations. A global RRT path planner is used to explore the space of possible manipulandum configurations, while a local push planner makes use of predictive models of pushing interactions, to plan sequences of pushes to move the manipulandum from one RRT node to the next. The effectiveness of the algorithm is demonstrated in simulation experiments in which a robot must move a rigid body through complex 3D transformations by applying only a sequence of simple single finger pushes.",

Here, roadmap nodes are generated from the intersections between C-obstacles and a set of uniformly distributed fixed-length segments in C-space. The results show that this new sampling method yields samples that are more uniformly distributed than previous obstacle-based methods such as OBPRM, Gaussian sampling, and Bridge test sampling. UOBPRM is shown to have nodes more uniformly distributed near C-obstacle surfaces and also requires the fewest nodes and edges to solve challenging motion planning problems with varying narrow passages.",

Photo-bleaching of fluorescence is one of the most crucial factors to cause measurement error in physiological measurement. In our approach, difference of fluorescent intensity between imaging time is compensated using single exponential function to make the difference amount uniform in each imaging time. We evaluated the dependencies of measurable time and the sensitivity by fluorescent lifetime and the decay coefficient of fluorescent lifetime using numerical simulation. From these results, the proposed method has much higher sensitivity and longer measurable time against conventional compensation method of photo-bleaching. By using the proposed method, we demonstrate the photosynthesis activity of single Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 in the micro chamber with gas barrier layer.",

        "abstract": "This paper presents an approach for understanding the soft tissue behavior in surface contact with a hard object scanning the tissue. The application domain is confocal microlaparoscope imaging, mostly used for imaging the outer surface of the organs in the abdominal cavity. The probe (optic-head) is swept over the tissue to collect sequential images to obtain a large field of view with mosaicing. The problem we address is that the tissue also moves with the probe due to its softness; therefore the resulting mosaic is not in the same shape and dimension as traversed by the probe. Our approach inspires from the finger slip studies and adapts the idea of load-and-slip that explains the movement of the finger when dragged on a hard surface. We propose the concept of loading-distance and perform measurements with in total 84 experiments on beef liver and chicken breast tissues. Our results indicate that the loading-distance can be measured prior to a scan and be used during the scan in order to compensate the movement of the probe. In this way we can have an image-mosaic of the tissue surface in a desired shape.",

        "abstract": "Few effective technologies exist for sensing in dark or murky underwater situations. For this reason, we have been exploring the use of a novel biologically-inspired approach to non-visual sensing based on the detection of perturbations to a self generated electric field. This is used by many species of neotropical nocturnal freshwater fish. This approach, termed active electrosense, presents unique challenges for sensing and tracking of nearby objects. We explore two methods for estimating the velocity of objects through active electrosense. The first of these methods uses a simple cross-correlation method, which depends on the uniformity of the electric field. We show some of the ramifications of making this assumption for a self-generated field around a cylindrical pod-shaped sensor in a rectangular tank. We then evaluate the use of methods developed for electrical impedance tomography (EIT) for localization and tracking. This is an unusual application of EIT in that typical applications involve surrounding the volume of interest (such as the thorax of humans) with sensor/emitters. Here, rather than this \u201coutside in\u201d approach, we are using EIT \u201cinside out.\u201d In simulation, we nonetheless find significant improvements in the accuracy of estimated velocity when using the EIT approach. Additionally, we demonstrate how EIT may be used for accurate position estimation. Under the conditions evaluated, the computation time for inversion is low enough to make its use feasible as a primary position and velocity estimator in an on- line system or as a secondary system to augment a computationally inexpensive estimator.",

        "abstract": "Existing auditory functions for robots such as sound source localization and separation have been implemented in a cascaded framework whose overall performance may be degraded by any failure in its subsystems. These approaches often require a careful and environment-dependent tuning for each subsystems to achieve better performance. This paper presents a unified framework for sound source localization and separation where the whole system is integrated as a Bayesian topic model. This method improves both localization and separation with a common configuration under various environments by iterative inference using Gibbs sampling. Experimental results from three environments of different reverberation times confirm that our method outperforms state-of-the-art sound source separation methods, especially in the reverberant environments, and shows localization performance comparable to that of the existing robot audition system.",

In order to include the effects of the interaction of the robot with its environment, required by the manipulation task in the balance control, we introduce a distributed preview control which captures both balance and manipulation behaviors and enables the regulation of the interaction impedance. The initial ZMP preview control is extended to take into account the disturbance resulting from the manipulation task and the preview control of adaptive impedances used to drive the upper-limbs. The resulting behavior is illustrated in a simple scenario. Its aptitude to dynamically extract an optimal control strategy improving tracking performances of both manipulation and balance tasks is also assessed when complex perturbations have to be compensated.",

        "abstract": "There is demand to develop methods and interfaces for teleoperation of complex systems in mission-critical applications. In this paper, we study three different methods to command a one-arm mobile manipulator from a 6-DOF input device capable of haptic feedback. The linkage between the master and the slave devices is asymmetric, that is, the input haptic interface (master) is much smaller and has different kinematics and dynamics from the robot arm and the mobile base (slave). Three different master-slave motion coordination schemes are compared here (1) workspace clutching, (2) differential end-zone, and (3) position/rate switching. We study repetitive user performance for seven subjects in a static Tower of Hanoi manipulation task and present single case studies for two mobile manipulation tasks: door opening and large-displacement Towers of Hanoi. Our experimental platform consists of a 4-DOF WAM (Whole Arm Manipulator) on a Segway RMP (Robotic Mobility Platform) controlled by a Phantom Omni haptic device. Cameras are used to relay scene images to the remote operator. The human stays in the loop throughout the entire task. The results obtained from user studies provide insight on how to interface and command a mobile manipulator.",

We have built a system to automatically build a tree structure from observations of an actor performing such activities. The activity trees that result form a framework for search and understanding, tying action to language. We explore and evaluate the system by performing experiments over a novel complex activity dataset taken using synchronized Kinect and SR4000 Time of Flight cameras. Processing of the combined 3D and 2D image data provides the necessary terminals and events to build the tree from the bottom-up. Experimental results highlight the contribution of the action grammar in: 1) providing a robust structure for complex activity recognition over real data and 2) disambiguating interleaved activities from within the same sequence.",

The influence of categorical thinking on interpersonal expectations is commonly referred to as a stereotype. The ability to bootstrap the process of learning about a newly encountered, unknown person is critical for robots interacting in complex and dynamic social situations. This article contributes a novel cluster-based algorithm that allows a robot to create generalized models of its interactive partner. These generalized models, or stereotypes, act as a source of information for predicting the human's behavior and preferences. We show, in simulation and using real robots, that these stereotyped models of the partner can be used to bootstrap the robot's learning about the partner in spite of significant error. The results of this work have potential implications for social robotics, autonomous agents, and possibly psychology.",

        "abstract": "Series elastic actuators are very popular in rehabilitation robotics. Among other advantages, elastic elements between the actuator and the load permit to store and release energy during the task completion, such that the energy balance is improved and the motor power peak is decreased. In rhythmic tasks like walking, this reduces to design the spring stiffness such that it works at resonance. To comply with different gaits and cadences, it is therefore necessary to design Variable Stiffness Actuators (VSA). This paper proposes three contributions: (i) we apply a particular concept of VSA to an active ankle prosthesis; (ii) we discuss the relevance of using VSA to change the stiffness also within the gait cycle; and (iii) we elaborate some control strategies for this device. Our guideline is to track a mechanical design and a controller maximizing energy efficiency. We establish that a promising approach is simply to control the amount of energy stored in the elastic element.",

        "abstract": "State of the art methods for state estimation and perception make use of least-squares optimization methods to perform efficient inference on noisy sensor data. Much of this efficiency is achieved by using sparse matrix factorization methods. The sparsity structure of the underlying matrix factorization which makes these optimization methods tractable is highly dependent on the choice of variable reordering; but there has been no systematic evaluation of reordering methods in the SLAM community. In this paper we evaluate the performance of various reordering techniques on benchmark SLAM data sets and provide definitive recommendations based on our results. We also compare these state of the art algorithms against our simple and easy to implement algorithm which achieves comparable performance. Finally, we provide empirical evidence that few gains remain with respect to variants of minimum degree ordering.",

The control system is composed of a multi-agent team and aggregates the actions of the individual agents of the team to form a single output. In the process, this approach attempts to use error and variation that naturally occurs in physical systems to the system's advantage. We apply this multi-agent control system to a multiple task allocation problem and present an analytical model with which we can study the conditions under which such a system is expected to stabilize. We then compare the expected behavior of the analytical model with an empirical agent-based simulation applied to a tracking problem.",

First, the elaboration of a 3D elevation map using data from dead reckoning, RTK-GPS and a laser sensor is described, where an extended Kalman filter was used for state and covariance estimation. Terrain traversability analysis is performed and scan points are voted in an elevation map which is probabilistically built and updated. Secondly, the vehicle's pose is estimated using a particle filter correcting the position towards the elevation map where GPS information is not used. Finally, experiments were performed in the mountainous gravelled paths of a quarry. Estimated localization results compared towards centimeter precision GPS show that the system offers sub-meter precision.",

        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "In this work, a multibody dynamics model of a wheeled mobile robot is developed to characterize the terrain reaction forces in terms of the physical and control parameters of the system. A common strategy for simulating the motion of mobile robots on soft soil is to compute the soil reaction forces using terramechanics models and to solve a forward dynamics problem by considering the soil reactions as a set of forces applied to the system. This intends to provide an accurate computation of the forces involved in the wheel-soil interaction; however, a series of factors such as the sensitivity of reaction forces to soil parameters limits the applicability of the existing terramechanics models in unstructured environments. We propose an alternative approach which does not rely on the soil properties, but at the same time does not intend to provide an exact computation of wheel-soil interaction forces. The main objective of this approach is to estimate the effect of changes in control and design parameters on the performance of the system, using the information provided by the dynamics model of the vehicle. To this end, the reaction forces for the wheel-terrain interaction in the ideal limit case of pure rolling and no penetration are obtained upon the specification of the motion at the contact points, via kinematic constraints. The validity of the analysis results obtained using the proposed paradigm is verified by simulation runs and experiments. The experimental results suggest that this approach is successful in predicting the variation of a set of important performance indicators in terms of the changes in the parameters of the system.",

        "abstract": "The design of grasping and manipulation systems is one of the most investigated topics in recent robotic and automation engineering. It is a process that has to take into account many development possibilities and to face different trade offs, as that between application possibilities and design complexity. In this work we present the design of a novel end-effector that merges the essential mechanics and control simplicity of underactuated devices, together with the high levels of manipulability usually featured in dexterous robotic hands. To obtain this enhancement, the proposed gripper considers the possibility offered by active surfaces, i.e. engineered contact surfaces able to simulate different levels of friction and to apply tangential thrust to the contacted object. The actual dexterity enhancement is evaluated by an analytical manipulability analysis and some examples of in hand manipulations and grasps are taken into account. A mechanical solution is presented, which implements the proposed idea through the adoption of one DoF active surfaces mounted on the fingers. The proposed solution presents a manipulability index one order of magnitude higher than common grippers.",

Specifically, we focus on the problem of visual-inertial odometry (VIO), in which the objective is to track the motion of a mobile platform in an unknown environment. Our primary interest is navigation using miniature devices with limited computational resources, similar for example to a mobile phone. Our proposed estimation framework consists of two main components: (i) a hybrid EKF estimator that integrates two algorithms with complementary computational characteristics, namely a sliding-window EKF and EKF-based SLAM, and (ii) an adaptive image-processing module that adjusts the number of detected image features based on the availability of resources. By combining the hybrid EKF estimator, which optimally utilizes the feature measurements, with the adaptive image-processing algorithm, the proposed estimation architecture fully utilizes the system's computational resources. We present experimental results showing that the proposed estimation framework is capable of real-time processing of image and inertial data on the processor of a mobile phone.",

        "abstract": "In this paper we consider an aerial vehicle equipped with a monocular camera and inertial sensors. Additionally, a laser pointer is mounted on the vehicle and it produces a laser spot. The laser spot is observed by the monocular camera and it is the unique point feature used in the proposed approach. We focus our attention to the case when the vehicle moves in proximity of a planar surface and in particular when the laser spot belongs to this surface. The paper provides two main contributions. The former is the analytical derivation of all the observable modes, i.e. all the physical quantities that can be determined by only using the inertial data and the camera observations of the laser spot during a short time-interval. Specifically, it is shown that the observable modes are: the distance of the vehicle from the planar surface; the component of the vehicle speed, which is orthogonal to the planar surface; the relative orientation of the vehicle with respect to the planar surface; the orientation of the planar surface with respect to the gravity. The second contribution is the introduction of a simple recursive method to perform the estimation of all the aforementioned observable modes. This method is based on a local decomposition of the original system, which separates the observable modes from the rest of the system. The method is validated by using synthetic data. Additionally, preliminary tests with real data are provided and more complete experiments are in progress. The presented approach can be integrated in the framework of autonomous take-off and landing, safe touch-down and low altitude manoeuvres even in dark or featureless environment.",

        "abstract": "In this paper, we describe our autonomous vision-based quadrotor MAV system which maps and explores unknown environments. All algorithms necessary for autonomous mapping and exploration run on-board the MAV. Using a front-looking stereo camera as the main exteroceptive sensor, our quadrotor achieves these capabilities with both the Vector Field Histogram+ (VFH+) algorithm for local navigation, and the frontier-based exploration algorithm. In addition, we implement the Bug algorithm for autonomous wall-following which could optionally be selected as the substitute exploration algorithm in sparse environments where the frontier-based exploration under-performs. We incrementally build a 3D global occupancy map on-board the MAV. The map is used by the VFH+ and frontier-based exploration in dense environments, and the Bug algorithm for wall-following in sparse environments. During the exploration phase, images from the front-looking camera are transmitted over Wi-Fi to the ground station. These images are input to a large-scale visual SLAM process running off-board on the ground station. SLAM is carried out with pose-graph optimization and loop closure detection using a vocabulary tree. We improve the robustness of the pose estimation by fusing optical flow and visual odometry. Optical flow data is provided by a customized downward-looking camera integrated with a microcontroller while visual odometry measurements are derived from the front-looking stereo camera. We verify our approaches with experimental results.",

While current state-of-the-art methods use descriptive features for visual tracking, we propose a novel approach using a sparse template based feature set, which is drawn from homogeneous regions on the object to be tracked. Using only a small number of simple features, without complex descriptors in combination with logarithmic-search, the tracker performs at hyper-real-time on HD-images without the use of parallelized hardware. Detailed benchmark experiments show that it outperforms most other state-of-the-art approaches for real-time object and person tracking in quality and runtime. In the experiments we also show the robustness of the tracker and evaluate the effects of different initialization methods, feature sets, and parameters on the tracker. Although we focus on the scenario of person and object tracking in robot applications, the proposed tracker can be used for a variety of other tracking tasks.",

An instantaneous inverse kinematic model devoted to vision is introduced. This model relies on the specificities of a parabolic profile hefty cable modeling and on the resulting simplified static analysis. By means of a kinematic visual servoing method, computer vision is used in the feedback loop for easier control. According to the modeling derived in this paper, measurements that allow the implementation of this visual servoing method consist of the mobile platform pose, the directions of the tangents to the cable curves at their drawing points and the cable tensions. The proposed visual servoing scheme will be applied to the control of a large parallel robot driven by eight cables. To this end, in order to obtain the aforementioned desired measurements, we plan to use a multi-camera setup together with force sensors.",

An iterative optimisation is derived that allows the properties of the wind field to be determined from successive measurements of the heading direction and ground track of the aircraft only. We have previously described methods for estimating these parameters using a single vision system. This approach therefore constitutes a purely visual method for estimating the properties of the local wind field. We present results from simulated and real-world flight tests that demonstrate the accuracy and robustness of the proposed method and its practicality in uncontrolled environmental conditions. These properties and the simplicity of the implementation should make this approach useful as an alternative means for estimating the properties of the local wind field from small-scale, fixed-wing UAVs.",

        "abstract": "We propose a novel method of visual anomaly detection for mobile robots in daily real-life settings. Visual anomaly detection using mobile robots is important for security systems or simply for gathering information. However, this task is challenging for two reasons. First, because the number of observed images sampled at the same location is small, anomaly detection systems cannot use standard statistical methods. Second, anomalies must be detected in the presence of other continuous, ambient changes in the visual scene, such as changes in lighting from morning to night. Regarding the former problem, we develop and apply an analysis-by-synthesis-based anomaly detection method for mobile robots. For the latter, we propose a novel definition of anomaly that uses observed samples at other locations to filter out ambient changes that should be ignored by the system. Experimental results demonstrate that our method can detect anomalies from small samples in the presence of ambient changes, which could not be detected by conventional methods.",

In contrast to the Bag-of-Words (BoW) approach, which is dominant in recent studies of the loop closure detection problem that derives an image descriptor from locally extracted keypoint descriptors, our method relies on a single efficient image descriptor of low dimension to describe and measure similarities among images. We employ PCA to transform a high dimensional Gabor-Gist descriptor to a lower dimensional form to improve both the computational efficiency of our method and the discriminative power of the image descriptor. In addition, we use a particle filter to exploit the correlation among images in a sequence captured by the robot in the process of identifying loop closure candidates. Our method is highly scalable due to the compactness of the image descriptor and the simplicity of particle filtering. To validate our method, we used the Oxford City dataset. Our experimental results show that for this dataset, high recall (up to 87%) can be obtained at 100% precision, with only a few particles.",

        "abstract": "In this paper we propose a new way to achieve direct visual servoing. The novelty is the use of the sum of conditional variance to realize the optimization process of a positioning task. This measure, which has previously been used successfully in the case of visual tracking, has been shown to be invariant to non-linear illumination variations and inexpensive to compute. Compared to other direct approaches of visual servoing, it is a good compromise between techniques using the illumination of pixels which are computationally inexpensive but non robust to illumination variations and other approaches using the mutual information which are more complicated to compute but offer more robustness towards the variations of the scene. This method results in a direct visual servoing task easy and fast to compute and robust towards non-linear illumination variations. This paper describes a visual servoing task based on the sum of conditional variance performed using a Levenberg-Marquardt optimization process. The results are then demonstrated through experimental validations and compared to both photometric-based and entropy-based techniques.",

        "abstract": "We present a follow-the-leader scenario with a system of two small low-cost quadrocopters of different types and configurations. The leader is a Parrot AR.Drone which is controlled by an iPad App utilizing the visual odometry provided by the quadrocopter and pilots it autonomously. The follower is an Asctec Hummingbird which is controlled by an onboard 8-bit microcontroller. Neither communication nor external sensors are required. A custom-built pan/tilt unit and the camera of a Nintendo Wii remote tracks a pattern of infrared lights and allows for online pose estimation. A base station allows for monitoring the behavior but is not required for autonomous flights. Our efficient solution of the perspective-3-point problem allows for estimating the pose of the camera relative to the pattern in six degrees of freedom at a high frequency on the microcontroller. The presented experiments include a scenario in which the follower follows the leader with a constant distance of two meters flying different shapes in narrow, GPS-denied indoor environment.",

Our framework achieves Simultaneous Localization And Mapping (SLAM) with previously unseen robustness in onboard aerial navigation for small platforms with natural restrictions on weight and computational power. We demonstrate successful operation in flights with altitude between 0.2\u201370 m, trajectories with 350 m length, as well as dynamic maneuvers with track speed of 2 m/s. All flights shown are performed autonomously using vision in the loop, with only high-level waypoints given as directions.",

        "abstract": "An autonomous wall inspection control based on a stereo optical flow, suitable for unmanned aerial vehicles endowed with a stereo vision system, is proposed in this paper. The inspection task consists of simultaneously controlling the inspection velocity along the surface, the relative yaw angle between the vehicle and the observed plane, as well as the orthogonal distance. A virtual spherical camera is considered at the center of gravity of the vehicle. Then, a stereo optical flow, as if it had been acquired by the virtual camera, is generated from the visual data provided by the stereo vision system. The 3D visual measurements are also employed to estimate the relative position and orientation of the observed plane. Hence, the absolute vehicle velocity is estimated by using a robust translational average optical flow by integrating the total stereo flow. Finally, an inspection control and a hovering control are proposed. The effectiveness of the described approach has been demonstrated with a dynamic simulation in an environment composed of two adjacent walls.",

In order to regain motor function of the upper body, patients are usually treated by regular sessions with a dedicated physical therapist. A cost-effective wearable upper body orthotics system that can be used at home to empower both the patients and physical therapists is described. The system is composed of a thin, compliant, lightweight, cost-effective soft orthotic device with an integrated cable actuation system that is worn over the upper body, an embedded limb position sensing system, an electric actuator package and controller. The proposed device is robust to misalignments that may occur during actuation of the compliant brace or when putting on the system. Through simulations and experimental evaluation, it was demonstrated i) that the soft orthotic cable-driven shoulder brace can be successfully actuated without the production of off-axis torques in the presence of misalignments and ii) that the proposed model can identify linear and angular misalignments online.",

The common-sense knowledge about object locality (CSOL), e.g. a cup is usually located on the table top rather than on the floor and vice versa for a trash bin, is a very helpful context information for a robotic visual search task. In this paper, we propose an online knowledge acquisition mechanism for discovering CSOL, thereby facilitating a more efficient and robust robotic visual search. The proposed mechanism is able to create conceptual knowledge with the information acquired from the largest and the most diverse medium - the Internet. Experiments using an indoor mobile robot demonstrate the efficiency of our approach as well as reliability of goal-directed robot behaviour.",

In ad hoc domains, the capabilities of the robots and how well they perform as a team is initially unknown, and the goal is to find the optimal role assignment policy of the robots that will attain the highest value. In this paper, we formally define the weighted synergy graph for role assignment (WeSGRA), that models the capabilities of robots in different roles as Normal distributions, and uses a weighted graph structure to model how different role assignments affect the overall team value. We contribute a learning algorithm that learns a WeSGRA from training examples of role assignment policies and observed values, and a team formation algorithm that approximates the optimal role assignment policy. We evaluate our model and algorithms in extensive experiments, and show that the learning algorithm learns a WeSGRA model with high log-likelihood that is used to form a near-optimal team. Further, we apply theWeSGRA model to simulated robots in the RoboCup Rescue domain, and to real robots in a foraging task, and show that the role assignment policy found by WeSGRA attains a high value and outperforms other algorithms, thus demonstrating the efficacy of the WeSGRA model.",

        "abstract": "Many robotics tasks require the robot to predict what lies in the unexplored part of the environment. Although much work focuses on building autonomous robots that operate indoors, indoor environments are neither well understood nor analyzed enough in the literature. In this paper, we propose and compare two methods for predicting both the topology and the categories of rooms given a partial map. The methods are motivated by the analysis of two large annotated floor plan data sets corresponding to the buildings of the MIT and KTH campuses. In particular, utilizing graph theory, we discover that local complexity remains unchanged for growing global complexity in real-world indoor environments, a property which we exploit. In total, we analyze 197 buildings, 940 floors and over 38,000 real-world rooms. Such a large set of indoor places has not been investigated before in the previous work. We provide extensive experimental results and show the degree of transferability of spatial knowledge between two geographically distinct locations. We also contribute the KTH data set and the software tools to with it.",

The structure of the PMR consists of a seat slider and two independent leg wheels attached on either side; this enables the driver to mount the PMR by changing the vehicle's height from the squatting position to the standing position. In addition, this structure can control the roll posture of the vehicle and thus prevent the PMR from toppling over because of a short tread. The seat slider facilitates a stable pitch posture with suitable control. We present an overview of the kinematic structure, three-dimensional dynamics model, and control method based on the linear-quadratic regulator (LQR), in order to achieve stable control of the PMR.",

        "abstract": "As elaborate human-robot interaction capabilities continue to develop, humans will increasingly be in proximity with robots, and the management of the ongoing control in case of breakdown becomes increasingly important: taking care of what happens when cooperation goes wrong. The current research addresses three categories of breakdowns where cooperation can go wrong. In the first category, the human detects some type of problem and generates a self-issued stop signal, with a physical palm up posture. In the second category, the human becomes distracted, and physically changes his orientation away from the shared space of cooperation. In the final category that we investigate, the human becomes physically close to the robot such that safety limits are reached and detected by the robot. In each of these three cases, the robot cognitive system detects the failure via the perception of distinct physical states from motion capture: the hand up posture; change in head orientation; and physical distance reaching a minimum threshold. In each case the robot immediately halts the current action. Then, the system should recover appropriately. Each error type returns a specific code, allowing the Supervisor system to handle the specific type of error. Our cognitive system allows the robot to learn composite actions, as a sequence of atomic actions. These composite actions can then be composed into higher level plans. When a plan fails at the level of a composite action, the recovery method is not trivial: should recovery take place at the level of the composite action, or the actual atomic action which physically failed? As the best recovery may depend on the physical context, we expand the plan into atomic actions, and recover at this level, allowing the user to specify whether the action should be skipped or retried. We demonstrate that this system allows graceful recovery from three principal categories of interaction breakdown, and provides an invaluable mechanism for pres... Show More",

        "abstract": "Tactile sensing can be an important source of information for robots, and texture discrimination in particular is useful in object recognition and terrain identification. Whisker based tactile sensing has recently been shown to be a promising approach for mobile robots, using simple sensors and many classification approaches. However these approaches have often been tested in limited environments, and have not been compared against one another in a controlled way. A wide range of whisker-object contact poses are possible on a mobile robot, and the effect such contact variability has on sensing has not been properly investigated. We present a novel, carefully controlled study of simple surface texture classifiers on a large set of varied pose conditions that mimic those encountered by mobile robots. Namely, single brief whisker contacts with textured surfaces at a range of surface orientations and contact speeds. Results show that different classifiers are appropriate for different settings, with spectral template and feature based approaches performing best in surface texture, and contact speed estimation, respectively. The results may be used to inform selection of classifiers in tasks such as tactile SLAM.",

        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "This paper presents a state space model for a multiperson ensemble and an estimation method of the onset timings, tempos, and leaders. In a multiperson ensemble, determining one explicit leader is difficult because (1) participants' rhythms are mutually influenced and (2) they compete with each other. Most ensemble studies however assumed that one leader exists at a time and the others just follow the leader. To deal with the multiple and time-varying leaders, we define leaderness indicating the power to influence the others as the product of the tempo stability and the distance from the ensemble tempo. This definition means that a leader should have a strong desire to change the current tempo. Using the leaderness, we present a state space model of a multiperson ensemble and an unscented Kalman filter based estimation method. The model consists of the leaderness update, the ensemble tempo update, the individual tempo update, and the onset timing adaptation, each of which has a relationship to psychological results of an ensemble. We evaluate our method using simulation and human behavior. The simulation results show that our model is stable for various initial tempos and the number of participants. For the human behavior, pairs and triads of participants are asked to tap keys in synchronization with the others. The results show that the leaderness successfully indicate the dynamics of the leaders, and the onset errors are 181msec and 241msec for pairs and triads on average, respectively, which are comparable to those of humans (153msec and 227msec for pairs and triads, respectively.)",

        "abstract": "Whole-body force sensation with a simple configuration is desirable for robots in human environment. This paper deals with a force sensor-based whole-body force sensing technique of robots and expand it to arbitrary shape end-effectors. Previous techniques could not deal with a non-convex-shaped end-effector since multiple candidates of contact points exist for contact position identification. The problem was solved by explicitly using the property of an external force vector whose direction changes with respect to time. It was found that inertial force degraded the detection rate in cases in which vibration occurred in the end-effector, but it was possible to improve the rate by acquiring data over a longer period of time. It was empirically confirmed that accurate whole-body force sensation is feasible using a non-convex-shaped end-effector.",

        "abstract": "In this paper, we propose a passive wire-type motion support system to guide a human hand through the use of servo brakes. This system is intrinsically safe because servo brakes cannot generate a driving force to control the system. On the other hand, this system may not generate sufficient force to guide the human hand along the desired path because of the use of servo brakes. To resolve this problem, the standard approach would be to increase the number of brake units to generate the desired force. However, the large number of wires attached to each brake unit might restrict the user's motions, and there would be a potential for injury if the wires entwined around the user. Therefore, in order to safely guide the user's motion, we need to decrease the number of brake units having wires. In this paper, we consider a feasible braking force region of the wire-type passive system with multiple brake units and discuss the number of brake units required to guide the user's motion appropriately. We develop the wire-type motion support system that uses servo brakes and conduct path-following experiments considering table tennis as an example of sports training. In addition, we present experimental results that show the passive system with a small number of brake units can guide the user's hand along the desired path.",

Preliminarily, we defined a prioritized Jacobian and a prioritized inverse of Jacobian to formulate the dynamically decoupled model in the task space for the constrained multi-contact multi-rigid-body system with a floating base. Our strategy has two tracks to accommodate the uncertainty and the complexity of the system dynamics. 1) The time-delay estimation and control are combined with the nonlinear programming. 2) Whole kinodynamic constraints are derived as functions of the control input. The proposed balance control algorithm allows the system to traverse desired trajectories satisfying the kinodynamic constraints and improves the mobility of locomotion. The effectiveness of the algorithm is tested with the dynamic simulations.",

        "abstract": "In swarm robotics, large groups of relatively simple robots cooperate so that they can perform tasks that go beyond their individual capabilities [1], [2]. The interactions among the robots are based on simple behavioral rules that exploit only local information. The robots in a swarm have neither global knowledge, nor a central controller. Therefore, decisions in the swarm have to be taken in a distributed manner based on local interactions. Because of these limitations, the design of collective decision-making methods in swarm robotic systems is a challenging problem. Moreover, the collective decision-making method must be efficient, robust with respect to robot failures, and scale well with the size of the swarm.",

        "abstract": "This paper presented a click mechanism, which is inspired by a Dipteran insect, for use in flapping-wing micro aerial vehicle. The clicking mechanism is integrated in a thorax-like compliant mechanism, which buckles and consequently produces a large wing stroke when driven by an electric motor. The thorax-like compliant mechanism can store elastic energy in flexible hinges and is good for storing kinetic energy expended during wing reversal. This work showed that clicking compliant mechanism produces more thrust per input power than a conventional non-clicking rigid-body mechanism. The clicking prototype weighs 3.58g, has 115\u00b0 wing stroke, and is able to achieve hovering at 15.8Hz flapping frequency. The non-clicking prototype is lighter at 3.35g with a wingstroke of 100\u00b0, but could not achieve hover but could not achieve hovering even though driven by the same motor at a faster flapping frequency (16.2Hz) under the same driving voltage (4.9 V). The clicking prototype produces a thrust-to-power ratio of 2.17g/W, higher than 1.15g/W of the nonclicking counterpart.",

        "track": "main",
        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "The problem of door opening is fundamental for robots operating in domestic environments. Since these environments are generally less structured than industrial environments, several types of uncertainties associated with the dynamics and kinematics of a door must be dealt with to achieve successful opening. This paper proposes a method that can open doors without prior knowledge of the door kinematics. The proposed method can be implemented on a velocity-controlled manipulator with force sensing capabilities at the end-effector. The method consists of a velocity controller which uses force measurements and estimates of the radial direction based on adaptive estimates of the position of the door hinge. The control action is decomposed into an estimated radial and tangential direction following the concept of hybrid force/motion control. A force controller acting within the velocity controller regulates the radial force to a desired small value while the velocity controller ensures that the end effector of the robot moves with a desired tangential velocity leading to task completion. This paper also provides a proof that the adaptive estimates of the radial direction converge to the actual radial vector. The performance of the control scheme is demonstrated in both simulation and on a real robot.",
