        "abstract": "Vision-aided Inertial Navigation Systems (V-INS) can provide precise state estimates for the 3D motion of a vehicle when no external references (e.g., GPS) are available. This is achieved by combining inertial measurements from an IMU with visual observations from a camera under the assumption that the rigid transformation between the two sensors is known. Errors in the IMU-camera calibration process causes biases that reduce the accuracy of the estimation process and can even lead to divergence. In this paper, we present a Kalman filter-based algorithm for precisely determining the unknown transformation between a camera and an IMU. Contrary to previous approaches, we explicitly account for the time correlations of the IMU measurements and provide a figure of merit (covariance) for the estimated transformation. The proposed method does not require any special hardware (such as spin table or 3D laser scanner) except a calibration target. Simulation and experimental results are presented that validate the proposed method and quantify its accuracy.",

        "abstract": "In this paper, we propose a vision control strategy to perform automatic microassembly tasks in threedimension (3-D), and develop relevant control software. Specifically, using a 6 degree-of-freedom (DOF) robotic workstation to control a passive microgripper to automatically grasp a designated micropart from the chip, pivot the micropart, and then move the micropart to vertically insert into a designated slot on the chip. In the proposed control strategy, the whole microassembly task is divided into two subtasks, micro-grasping and micro-joining, in sequence. To guarantee the success of microassembly and manipulation accuracy, two different two-stage feedback motion strategies, the pattern matching and auto-focus method are employed, with the use of vision-based control system and the vision control software developed. Experiments conducted demonstrate the efficiency and validity of the proposed control strategy.",

        "abstract": "We developed a novel technique to manipulate lipid nanotubes in 3D by laser tweezers in water solutions. Laser tweezers are well known as one of the noncontact manipulation methods used in a closed space. We reported on 3D 6DOF manipulation of microbeads using 3D Synchronized Laser Micromanipulation (SLM), however, the blur is generated in the microscope image when multiple points at different height are trapped by scanning the focal point of laser. Moreover, it is difficult to manipulate a nano scaled rod-like object stably in 3D, since optical trap force is weak. To manipulate a lipid nanotube for example, firstly, we newly developed an observation system to improve blur of image by synchronization of shutter timing of CCD camera and laser scanning. As a result, we can obtain a clear image of the targets at different height while manipulating them. Secondly, we developed functional gel microtools which can adhere to the lipid nanotubes. We succeeded in controlling the position and orientation of the lipid nanotubes by using 3D SLM with shutter timing control method and novel functional gel microtools.",

        "abstract": "We present a Graph-based method for low-level segmentation of unfiltered 3D data. The core of this approach is based on the construction of a local neighborhood structure and its recursive subdivision. The Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) is the graph support used to measure the attribute variation through the region. The subdivision criterion relies on the evidence for a boundary between two partitions, which is detected through MST edge analysis. Although our algorithm converges to a local minimum, our experiments show that it produces segments that satisfy global properties. We assume that the 3D image is composed of regions homogeneous according to some criterion (color, curvature, etc.), but no assumption about noise, nor spatial repartition/shape of the regions or points is made. Robustness is achieved by choosing the appropriate neighborhood and the analysis of noise impact on the MST construction. We demonstrate the performance of our algorithm with experimental results on real images.",

        "abstract": "This paper presents a new technique for the update of a probabilistic spatial occupancy grid map using a forward sensor model. Unlike currently popular inverse sensor models, forward sensor models can be found experimentally and can represent sensor characteristics better. The formulation is applicable to both 2D and 3D range sensors and does not have some of the theoretical and practical problems associated with the current approaches which use forward models. As an illustration of this procedure, a new prototype 3D forward sensor model is derived using a beam represented as a spherical sector. Furthermore, this model is used for fusion of point-clouds obtained from different 3D sensors, in particular, time-of-flight sensors (Swiss-ranger, laser range finders), and stereo vision cameras. Several techniques are described for an efficient data-structure representation and implementation. The range beams from different sensors are fused in a common local Cartesian occupancy map. Experimental results of this fusion are presented and evaluated using Hough-transform performed on the grid.",

These general solutions are not known in closed-form, and existing closed-form solutions require additional bearing sensors, or impose strong constraints on the geometric structure of the manipulator (in our case, the robots\u2019 trajectories). This paper presents, for the first time, an efficient, algebraic algorithm to solve the relative pose using 10 distance measurements, without imposing any constraints on the robots\u2019 motion. We further present a weighted leastsquares refinement step, and validate our algorithm in various simulations, demonstrating its efficiency and accuracy.",

This effect is accomplished through the use of an exoskeleton that displays active impedance. The proposed method is aimed at improving the dynamic response of the human limbs, while preserving the user\u2019s control authority. Our goal is to use active-impedance exoskeleton control to improve the user\u2019s agility of motion, for example by reducing the average time needed to complete a movement. Our control method has been implemented in a 1-DOF exoskeleton designed to assist human subjects performing knee flexions and extensions. In this paper we discuss an initial study on the effect of negative exoskeleton damping (a particular case of active-impedance control) on the subject\u2019s time to complete a target-reaching motion. Experimental results show this effect to be statistically significant. On average, subjects were able to reduce the time to complete the motion by 16%.",

        "abstract": "Driving in unknown natural outdoor terrain is a challenge for autonomous ground vehicles. It can be difficult for a robot to discern obstacles and other hazards in its environment, and characteristics of this high cost terrain may change from one environment to another, or even with different lighting conditions. One successful approach to this problem is for a robot to learn from a demonstration by a human operator. In this paper, we describe an approach to calculating terrain costs from Bayesian estimates using feature vectors measured during a short teleoperated training run in similar terrain and conditions. We describe the theory, its implementation on two different robotic systems, and results of several independently conducted field tests.",

Robotic systems that rely on high quality sensory data can be sensitive to data containing outliers. Since the standard Kalman filter is not robust to outliers, other variations of the Kalman filter have been proposed to overcome this issue, but these methods may require manual parameter tuning, use of heuristics or complicated parameter estimation. Our Kalman filter uses a weighted least squares-like approach by introducing weights for each data sample. A data sample with a smaller weight has a weaker contribution when estimating the current time step's state. We learn the weights and system dynamics using a variational Expectation-Maximization framework. We evaluate our Kalman filter algorithm on data from a robotic dog.",

Specifically, this work details efforts taken towards learning and generating concepts from the perceived objects and attempts to classify places using the concepts gleaned. The approach is based on learning from exemplars, clustering and the use of Bayesian network classifiers. Experiments on conceptualization and place classification are reported.

To achieve this, the robot should be able to robustly predict the beat times in real time while listening to musical performance with its own ears (head-embedded microphones). However, this has not previously been addressed in most studies on music-synchronized robots due to the difficulty in predicting the beat times in real-world music. To solve this problem, we implemented a beat-tracking method developed in the field of music information processing. The predicted beat times are then used by a feedback-control method that adjusts the robot's step intervals to synchronize its steps in time with the beats. The experimental results show that the robot can adjust its steps in time with the beat times as the tempo changes. The resulting robot needed about 25 [s] to recognize the tempo change after it and then synchronize its steps.",

In computer graphics animation, such motion is created by mapping human motion to the animated character. This paper proposes a method for mapping human facial motion to the android. This is done using a linear model of the android, based on blendshape models used in computer graphics. The model is derived from motion capture of the android and therefore also models the android's physical limitations. The paper shows that the blendshape method can be successfully applied to the android. Also, it is shown that a linear model is sufficient for representing android facial motion, which means control can be very straightforward. Measurements of the produced motion identify the physical limitations of the android and allow identifying the main areas for improvement of the android design.",

        "abstract": "This paper describes an approach to cooperative localization which finds its roots in robust estimation, employing an unknown-but-bounded error model for sensor measurements. In this framework, range and bearing measurements obtained by the robots are viewed as constraints which implicitly define a set of feasible solutions in the joint configuration space of the robot team. The scheme produces bounded uncertainty estimates for the relative configuration of the team by using convex optimization techniques to approximate the projection of this feasible set onto various subspaces of the configuration space. The scheme can also be used to localize distributed sensor nodes. An important advantage of the proposed approach is that it is able to produce bounded uncertainty estimates for the relative configuration of the robots even in the case where the relative orientations of the robots are completely unknown. This is an important practical advance since errors in relative orientation are often a major contributor to positioning uncertainty in multi-robot localization schemes.",

Both visual servoing techniques were tested on a microassembly workstation, and their regulation and tracking performances are evaluated. Calibrated visual servoing demands the optical system calibration for the image Jacobian estimation and if a precise optical system calibration is done, it ensures a better accuracy, precision and settling time compared with the uncalibrated approach. On the other hand, in the uncalibrated approach, optical system calibration is not required and since the Jacobian is estimated dynamically, it is more flexible.",

All the tested implementations used odometry for dead-reckoning as a base position measurement, and all but vSLAM use lasers as a main sensor (ERSP vSLAM uses a video camera). The comparison was taken using two different types of robots in three different environments: an office corridor, an office entry area, and an indoor robot driving course. The comparison uses a novel approach for map accuracy evaluation, one of the key factors in evaluating the performance of a SLAM implementation. The results show that even for similar setups, the outcomes can vary significantly for the different implementations, suggesting that the underlying implementations likely play a significant role in the SLAM performance.",

We present a robust distributed approach to target motion control that utilizes cooperation to minimize the average observation time of the evaders. Targets actively communicate with each other to gain a much richer view of the environment than their immediate sensors provide, and use such information to generate better motion decisions from the group viewpoint. Targets relay information coming from other targets to ensure maximal data spread, and cooperate to escape the pursuers in certain favorable situations. Extensive testing has demonstrated the superiority of the approach over other simpler strategies. Furthermore, robustness with respect to key environmental conditions has been evaluated, and the results suggest the algorithm is a good candidate for real-world applications.",

        "abstract": "This paper considers the problem of coordinating multiple vehicles with kinodynamic constraints that operate in the same partially-known environment. The vehicles are able to communicate within limited range. Their objective is to avoid collisions between them and with the obstacles, while the vehicles move towards their goals. An important issue of real-time planning for systems with bounded acceleration is that inevitable collision states must also be avoided. The focus of this paper is to guarantee safety despite the dynamic constraints with a decentralized motion planning technique that employs only local information. We propose a coordination framework that allows vehicles to generate and select compatible sets of valid trajectories and prove that this scheme guarantees collision-avoidance in the specified setup. The theoretical results have been also experimentally confirmed with a distributed simulator where each vehicle replans online with a sampling- based, kinodynamic motion planner and uses message-passing to communicate with neighboring agents.",

        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "This paper presents an efficient path planner to identify difficult regions for path planning in changing environments, in which obstacles can move randomly. The difficult regions consist of narrow passages and the boundaries of obstacles in robot Configuration Space (C-space). These regions exert significantly negative influence on finding a valid path in static environments. The problem becomes more complicated in changing environments, because that the regions will change their positions when obstacles move. Besides, it is necessary to identify difficult regions in real time since obstacles may move frequently. To identify difficult regions fast when they change their positions, a dynamic bridge builder is proposed based on a W-C nodes mapping and a Bridge planner method. The W-C nodes mapping is used not only to conserve the validity of nodes in C-space, but also to provide the information about where a \"bridge\" should be built, i.e. the positions of narrow passages, and where the boundaries of obstacles are. Furthermore, a hierarchy sampling strategy is employed to boost the density of nodes in difficult regions efficiently. In the query phase, a Lazy-edges evaluation method is adopted to validate the edges in a found path. Simulated experiments for a dual-manipulator system show that our method is efficient for path planning in changing environments.",

This robot relies on its own internal dynamic motions to gain height, unlike previous mechanisms which are quasi- static. One benefit of dynamics is that it allows climbing with only a single actuated degree of freedom. We show with analysis, simulations and experiments that this dynamic robot is capable of climbing vertically between parallel walls. We introduce simplifications that enable us to obtain closed form approximations of the robot motion. Furthermore, this provides us with some design considerations and insights into the mechanism's ability to climb.",

In humanoid robots, flexibility of the sensor is an important feature for preventing physical damage and for interacting with the human. Moreover, stretchability of the sensor has advantages that the sensor is nonbreakable and that the sensor can be easily mounted on curved surfaces or deformable parts such as joints. This paper proposes a novel tactile sensor made of flexible and stretchable silicone rubber. A structure of the sensor is similar to the capacitive tactile sensors. However, the proposed sensor utilizes a different principle from existing sensors. The sensor utilizes static electricity and electrostatic induction phenomenon, and can detect some touch conditions. This paper reports the principle and characteristics of the proposed sensor. Experiments show that the sensor output depends on touch area, touch velocity, and material of touch objects. However, the sensor does not depend on touch weight. Moreover, the experiment shows that even if the proposed sensor is stretched, it performs as the tactile sensor.",

Then the 3D plane parameters of the floor with respect to each ROI are estimated by a direct method using stereo images. We adopt the fast plane parameter estimation method [5], along with the compensation for the errors of the initial parameters by using the internal state of the robot, for the enhancement of the robustness and efficiency in the optimization process. Additionally, we estimate the shape of the floor including slopes from the set of the estimated plane parameters, and feedback the results for updating the footstep plan.

        "abstract": "This paper proposes a novel four-channel multilateral shared control architecture for dual-user teleoperation systems. The proposed control architecture is designed to allow interaction between two users as well as slave and environment through a dominance factor. The dominance factor adjusts the authority of the users over the slave robot and the task. To analyze transparency performance in dual-user systems, a number of performance measures are examined or proposed. These measures are evaluated for various types of environments, users' grasps, and levels of dominance of the users over the task.",

        "abstract": "In this paper we present a heuristic approach to planning in an environment with moving obstacles. Our approach assumes that the robot has no knowledge of the future trajectory of the moving objects. Our framework also distinguishes between two types of moving objects in the environment: hard and soft objects. We distinguish between the two types of objects in the environment as varying application domains could allow for some collision between some types of moving objects. For example, a robot planning a path in an environment with people could have the people modeled as circular disks with a safe zone surrounding each person. Although the robot may try to stay out of each safe zone, violating that criteria would not necessarily result in planning failure. We will show the effectiveness of our planner in general dynamic environments with the soft objects having varying behaviors.",

        "abstract": "A sophisticated and advanced strategy for kinematic calibration of parallel manipulators has been reported. The strategy relies on passing type two singularities (i.e., direct kinematic singularities) and is therefore referred to as singularity-based calibration. Within the parameter estimation process, the singularity-based calibration technique requires to solve a so-called singular kinematic problem (SKP). That is, it involves finding the position of one actuator for which the structure is in a singular configuration of type two under the condition that all other actuators are held at known constant positions. So far, this problem could only be solved for some simple manipulators and structure classes with a maximum of three degree of freedom and thereby limiting the applicability of the singularity-based calibration approach. This article contributes a general approach to close this gap making singularity-based calibration widely applicable. The technique demonstrated by means of exemplarily chosen parallel kinematic structures.",

An omnidirectional view may be acquired by a fisheye camera which provides a full image compared to catadioptric visual sensors and do not increase the size and the weakness of the imaging system with respect to perspective cameras. We prove that the unified model for catadioptric systems can model fisheye cameras with distortions directly included in its parameters. This unified projection model consists on a projection onto a virtual unitary sphere, followed by a perspective projection onto an image plane. The validity of this assumption is discussed and compared with other existing models. Calibration and partial Euclidean reconstruction results help to confirm the validity of our approach. Finally, an application to the visual servoing of a mobile robot is presented and experimented.",

When paired with an appropriate objective function, the solution to the resulting problem instance yields an optimal robot configuration for target tracking at each time-step, while guaranteeing target coverage (each target is tracked by at least one robot) and maintaining network connectivity. Our methodology is based on the graph theoretic result where the second smallest eigenvalue of the interconnection graph Laplacian matrix is a measure for the connectivity of the graph. This formulation enables us to model agent-target coverage and inter-agent communication constraints as linearmatrix inequalities.We also show that when the communication constraints can be relaxed, the resulting problem can be reposed as a second-order cone program (SOCP) which can be solved significantly more efficiently than its SDP counterpart. Simulation results for a team of robots tracking multiple targets are presented.",

What would be surprising is that such a simple control mechanism may underly the control of one of nature's fastest terrestrial insects, the American cockroach. For this paper, we implemented the same controller (up to scale) believed to govern cockroach wall following to successfully control two models of the cockroach: a differential-drive mobile robot with a flexible artificial antenna and a lateral leg spring model with moving center of pressure as the control input. These physical and numerical experiments demonstrate the sufficiency of the cockroach's putative controller in a real-world setting with unmodeled effects, and suggest how the nervous system might guide leg placement in response to sensory stimuli. This hierarchy of models may prove useful in generating prescriptive hypotheses for biological testing and hence elucidating the general principles that underly sensor-guided animal locomotion.",

Our approach uses ACD to subdivide the configuration space into cells and computes localized roadmaps by generating samples within these cells. We augment the connectivity graph for adjacent cells in ACD with pseudo-free edges that are computed based on localized roadmaps. These roadmaps are used to capture the connectivity of free space and guide the adaptive subdivision algorithm. At the same time, we use cell decomposition to check for path non-existence and generate samples in narrow passages. Overall, our hybrid algorithm combines the efficiency of PRM methods with the completeness of ACD-based algorithms. We have implemented our algorithm on 3-DOF and 4-DOF robots. We demonstrate its performance on planning scenarios with narrow passages or no collision-free paths. In practice, we observe up to 10 times improvement in performance over prior complete motion planning algorithms.",

        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "Vision-based robot localization in outdoor environments is difficult because of changing illumination conditions. Another problem is the rough and cluttered environment which makes it hard to use visual features that are not rotation invariant. A popular method that is rotation invariant and relatively robust to changing illumination is the Scale Invariant Feature Transform (SIFT). However, due to the computationally intensive feature extraction and image matching, localization using SIFT is slow. On the other hand, techniques which use global image features are in general less robust and exact than SIFT, but are often much faster due to fast image matching. In this paper, we present a hybrid localization approach that switches between local and global image features. For most images, the hybrid approach uses fast global features. Only in difficult situations, e.g. containing strong illumination changes, the hybrid approach switches to local features. To decide which features to use for an image, we analyze the particle cloud of the particle filter that we use for position estimation. Experiments on outdoor images taken under varying illumination conditions show that the position estimates of the hybrid approach are about as exact as the estimates of SIFT alone. However, the average localization time using the hybrid approach is more than 3.5 times faster than using SIFT.",

        "abstract": "Simple, fast and lightweight SLAM algorithms are necessary in many embedded robotic systems which soon will be used in houses and offices in order to do various service tasks. In this paper the Orthogonal SLAM algorithm is presented as an answer to this need. In continuation of our previous work, the algorithm is extended to generate 3D maps and empirically validated by mapping the long corridor of our lab with the accuracy comparable with hand measured ground truth. The main contribution resides in the idea of reducing the complexity by using orthogonality constraint in indoor environments. This is done by mapping only planes that are parallel or perpendicular to each other which represent the main structure of most indoor environments. Having this assumption, we use an inclined sensor setup (fixed 2D SICK laser range finders) to generate 3D orthogonal maps. The algorithm is extremely fast since in each step it just processes one line of laser measurements.",

        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "For a mobile robot to be able to communicate usefully with others, the symbols it uses to communicate must be grounded to entities in the environment, and those groundings made consistent among agents. While it is common practice to hand-construct such groundings, this does not scale to large problems. In particular, when communicating about useful spatial references, there are a large number of potentially relevant groundings, even for a basic task such as navigation. This paper describes the development and evaluation of an approach that allows a group of robotic agents to develop consistent shared groundings for locations in an environment over time. This approach is based on local communication and interaction, and does not rely on the ability to broadcast references to all agents, and so is suitable for domains in which communication may be sporadic, such as robotic rescue. The evaluation of this approach, which compares several different grounding techniques, shows that shared groundings can be developed effectively over time, and that these improve the effectiveness of communication in a multi-robot setting.",

But such motion planner should be complemented by a local motion planner that addresses the following issues: 1) ensure that two successive nodes belong to the same robot kinematic branch (otherwise connecting these nodes will require to disassemble the robot) 2) verify that all poses between nodes satisfy the robot constraints (if possible taking into account the uncertainties in the robot modeling) 3) eventually try to shorten the trajectory length We present such a local motion planner that addresses all three issues and illustrates its use on a Gough parallel robot.",

The formation of robot teams significantly enhances the performance and efficiency of search and rescue missions in such environments. As opposed to the classical partitioning application domains, the robot aggregation requires multiple confticting objectives to be optimized. We propose a novel microeconomic methodology for simultaneous multi-objective partitioning of robots. The method utilizes the strengths of K-Means algorithm, game theoretic modeling, and Nash equilibrium methodology for fast and socially fair partitioning. In this work, partitions are created on the basis of compaction and equipartitioning objectives to identify decentralized robot teams with each robot in a team closest to its communication gateway, as well as each team equally represented in terms of strength. Rigorous simulations were performed to evaluate the performance of the method, and the results indicate that the proposed method performs significantly better than the K-Means methodology, and identifies good solution points.",

As part of the Claytronics project - which aims to build very large ensembles of modular robots - we investigate how to simplify each module by eliminating moving parts and reducing the number of mechanical mechanisms on each robot by using force-at-a-distance actuators. Additionally, we are also investigating the feasibility of using these unary actuators to improve docking performance, implement intermodule adhesion, power transfer, communication, and sensing. In this paper we describe our most recent results in the magnetic domain, including our first design sufficiently robust to operate reliably in groups greater than two modules. Our work should be seen as an extension of systems such as Fracta [9], and a contrasting line of inquiry to several other researchers' prior efforts that have used magnetic latching to attach modules to one another but relied upon a powered hinge [10] or telescoping mechanism [12] within each module to facilitate self-reconfiguration.",

In this paper, a stable decentralized model-based controller is proposed that can enhance the teleoperation transparency in the presence of constant delay. New state/observation transformations produce partially delay-free dynamics/measurement vectors. Using the transformed states/observastions, two local linear quadratic Gaussian (LQG) controllers are implemented at the master and slave stations. The closed-loop stability is analyzed employing the delay-dependent frequency sweeping test. Using the LQG controllers and a simple control switching strategy, a multi- model teleoperation controller is developed that can achieve delay-free position tracking and tool impedance shaping for free motion/soft contact, as well as position and force tracking for contact with rigid environments. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.",

        "abstract": "Small unmanned air vehicles (UAVs) such as AeroVironments Puma, are designed for military support at the tactical level. These miniature UAVs can be rapidly deployed via a hand or bungee launch. Most commercial unmanned aircraft currently in service are autonomous in the sense that they can be programmed to follow GPS waypoint routes and can be updated in mid-flight. Typical missions include surveillance, reconnaissance, bomb damage assessment, and search and rescue. Although most missions are carried out at extremely low altitudes (e.g. 20100 meters), the UAV flight control systems do not have collision avoidance capabilities. Furthermore, flight in these low altitude or near-Earth environments, such as urban areas and mountainous terrain, often degrade GPS signals.",

        "abstract": "This paper reports a new myoelectric interface for robotic hand control consisting of two main parts. The first part concerns the motion classification using electromyogram (EMG) signals of a support vector machine (SVM). Because there has been little research on the application of the SVM to motion classification using EMG signals, its effectiveness has not yet been established. The SVM has some advantages with respect to generalization and computational complexity, and therefore, we used the SVM to examine its classification ability. The second part concerns the estimation of an operator's joint angle corresponding to the motion determined by the first part. Estimation of the operator's joint angles is based on EMG-Joint angle models, which express the linear relationships between the EMG signals and joint angles. To verify the effectiveness of our interface, we performed off-line hand motion classification and real-time robotic hand control experiments with eight subjects. The experimental results showed that seven hand motions achieved a classification rate of more than 90% for all subjects. In addition, a three-dimensional computer graphics robotic hand was controlled in real-time (62.5 Hz) without delay.",

        "abstract": "Intelligent autonomous mobile robots must be able to sense and recognize 3D environment for navigation and task execution where they live or work. To achieve this, a variety of techniques have been developed for the determination of the 3D geometric information such as stereo vision, laser structured light, laser range finder and so on. However, these methods have several limitations such as susceptibility to noise, low resolution, measurement error in 3D scene. In this paper to overcome these problems we introduce a new sensing method based upon stereo vision methodology which utilizes not only intensity information but also phase information. The novelty of this suggested method comes from the fact that it uses the stereo phase information from the PMP technique together with intensity information captured by stereo image. To verify the efficiency and accuracy of the proposed method, a series of experimental tests is performed. The results show that it greatly enhances correspondence matching performance and measurement resolution.",

        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "Toward obtaining a compact and multiresolution representation of 2D range scans, a wavelet framework is proposed for encoding an orientation measure called running angle (RA). A new shrinkage algorithm is developed using discrete wavelet transform of the RA signal, which leads to a simplified polyline approximation of the initial scanned points. This approach is evaluated in terms of segmentation of 2D range scans as a line extractor. As a proof of concept, an experiment is performed in our laboratory hallway by a mobile robot equipped with two SICK laser range finders which shows that it is possible to successfully segment raw measurements of the scanner using the proposed approach and obtain proper linear abstraction. Besides a simple, fast heuristic line extraction algorithm is also proposed for the sake of comparison. It is based on thresholding the changes of the incident angles between the laser beam and the vertices of the initial polygon observed by the scanner. Despite its simplicity, this approach performs rather well and can be used in structured environments with low measurement noise. Both approaches are experimentally evaluated and compared with some well known and commonly used line extraction algorithms.",

The motion capabilities of the new meta-module is similar to that of previous sliding cube style modules with the addition of one extra action, which is shown to improve the motion capabilities of the modules greatly. In general our work shows that if three simple actions, which is implemented by our proposed meta-module, is implemented by a self-reconfigurable robot module or meta-module then the control of the robot will be simple. The improved motion capabilities allow us to use offline planning for large groups consisting of hundreds of meta- modules. The simple motion constraints of the meta-module further allows us to implement a distributed cluster flow locomotion gait, with the interesting property that the group of meta-modules self-organizes into a shape that makes the locomotion efficient.",

        "abstract": "Lorentz force magnetic levitation devices have been used for fine positioning, compliant assembly, force- reflecting teleoperation, and haptic interaction. The advantages of Lorentz levitation devices compared to motorized linkage and/or cable devices include the lack of friction, hysteresis, and other nonlinearities in actuation dynamics, the simplicity and robustness of a single moving part, and the potential for high closed-loop control bandwidths, a large impedance range, and precise motion. The principal disadvantage of existing Lorentz levitation devices is their motion ranges of 25 mm or less in translation and 20 degrees or less in rotation, which limits their utility in application domains such as haptic interaction. In this paper a novel coil and magnet configuration is presented which extends the possible motion range of Lorentz force magnetic levitation devices to 50 mm and at least 60 degrees, twice the present maximum range in translation and three times the maximum rotation. The motion range of the device design is confirmed through computer-aided design models and the levitation feasibility is shown through magnetic finite element analysis.",

In this paper, we present a novel approach to the problem of power control strategy for series hybrid electric vehicles (SHEVs). We define 3 different SHEV operation modes and a cost function. After the support vector machine (SVM) training process, we generate a classifier to determine which operation mode should be chosen during driving cycles based on the road situation data, battery state of charge (SOC) data and vehicle speed data. The approach does not need models of SHEV devices, costs less computationally and is more efficient. These distinguished advantages make the approach more practicable in real-time operation. Simulation study proves the feasibility of the approach.",

        "abstract": "In this paper, we have constructed an artificial ecological system (AES) used to manage sensor's behaviour and maintain sensor network. We have defined two kinds of species for sensor nodes, one is called prey and the other is called predator. It is desired to keep these sensor nodes reach the blanket coverage and maximize, two species exist and ensure they will not die out. We use two methods namely self-deployment and self-maintenance. The sensor nodes dynamics model (SNDM) based on the molecular dynamics is used to implement the diffusion, and the sensor nodes ecological model (SNEM) is used to maintain the sensor nodes. With these two models, we can create an ecological balance environment with automatic recharge, automatic recycle and automatic quantity control.",

        "abstract": "The problem of tracking multiple objects poses a number of challenges due to the ambiguity of the observations and the presence of partial or complete occlusions. This paper introduces a novel extension to the Particle Filter algorithm for tracking multiple objects with a vision system. The presented approach instantiates separate particle filters for each object and explicitly handles partial and complete occlusion for non- transparent objects, as well as the instantiation and removal of filters in case new objects enter the scene or previously tracked objects are removed. As opposed to single particle filters or mixture particle filter approaches which estimate a single multi-modal distribution, the proposed filter extension allows the continued tracking of objects through occlusion situations as well as the tracking of multiple objects of different types. To allow for the handling of occlusions without an increase in computational complexity beyond the one of the Mixture Particle Filter, the approach presented here addresses occlusions by projecting particles into the image space and back into the particle space, thus avoiding the use of a joint distribution. To present qualitative results, experiments were performed using color-based tracking of multiple objects of different and identical colors. The experiments demonstrate that the Particle filters implemented using the proposed method effectively and precisely track multiple targets and can successfully instantiate and remove filters of objects that enter or leave the image area.",

        "track": "main",
        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "In the field of mobile robotics, trajectory details are seldom taken into account to qualify robot performance. Most metrics rely mainly on global results such as the total time needed or distance traveled to accomplish a given navigational task. Indeed, usually mobile roboticists assume that, by using appropriate navigation techniques, they can design controllers so that the error between the actual and the ideal trajectory can be maintained within prescribed bounds. This assumption indirectly implies that there is no interesting information to be extracted by comparing trajectories if their variation is essentially resulting from uncontrolled noisy factors. In this paper, we will instead show that analyzing and comparing resulting trajectories is useful for a number of reasons, including model design, system optimization, system performance, and repeatability. In particular, we will describe a trajectory analysis method based on point distribution models (PDMs). The applicability of this method is demonstrated on the trajectories of a real differential- drive robot, endowed with two different controllers leading to different patterns of motion. Results demonstrate that in the space of the PDM, the difference between the two controllers is easily quantifiable. This method appears also to be extremely useful for comparing real trajectories with simulated ones for the same set-up since it affords an assessment of the simulation faithfulness before and after appropriate tuning of simulation features.",

Three main topics are addressed that are especially relevant for teleoperation at these scales: transparency, impedance reflection according to human perception, and stability. The proposed passivity based bilateral control scheme provides a stable means of teleoperation with an adaptive force scaling factor according to impedance limits that can be set by the operator and as transparent as possible. As a result, a robust platform to perform teleoperated nanomanipulation on a broad range of materials is achieved. Performance of the resulting bilateral controller is demonstrated in experimental results for simple vertical nanomanipulation touching experiments on glass and polydimethylsiloxane substrates.",

        "abstract": "Digital microfluidic systems (DMFS) are a new class of lab-on-a-chip systems for biochemical analysis. A DMFS uses electro wetting to manipulate discrete droplets on a planar array of electrodes. The chemical analysis is performed by repeatedly moving, mixing, and splitting droplets on the electrodes. Recently, there has been a lot of interest in developing algorithms and computational tools for the design, simulation, and performance evaluation of DMFS. In this paper, we present an algorithm for coordinating droplet movement in batch mode operations on ring layouts with bus-phase addressing. In bus- phase systems, each electrode is not individually addressable, instead a set of electrodes are all controlled by the same signal. Though this hardware design simplifies chip fabrication, it increases the complexity of routing droplets. The presented algorithm allows multiple independent reactions, each with two reactants and one product, and chain reactions with multiple stages, where each stage produces reactants for the next stage, to take place simultaneously on the chip. This algorithm is scalable to different number of reactions within a limit which depends on the size of the layout, placement of sources and number of phases used. It also addresses any sensor constraints under which droplets need to visit sensor locations for specified amounts of time. We present simulation results using our algorithm to coordinate droplet movements for example analyses on a ring layout.",

STRAGEN can deal with different criteria to construct topological maps of the problem space, choosing neighbors that match these criteria and optimize different measures of the learned map. STRAGEN can also learn heterogeneous information, such as angles, torques and positions of a manipulator, preserving their characteristics. This algorithm was tested by generating trajectories for a robotic hand called Kanguera. Kanguera presents a new concept of anthropomorphic robot hand. The hand offers a suitable environment for experimental purposes due to its novel and more accurate transmission system. The implementation of adduction and abduction capacity for both the fingers and the thumb allows the execution of more complex movements.

        "abstract": "Autonomous guidance of micro-air vehicles (MAVs) in unknown environments is a challenging task because these artificial creatures have small aeromechanical time constants, which make them prone to be disturbed by gusts of wind. Flying insects are subject to quite similar kinds of disturbances, yet they navigate swiftly and deftly. Flying insects display high- performance visuo-motor control systems that have stood the test of time. They can therefore teach us how vision can be used for immediate and vital actions. We built a 50-gram tethered aerial demonstrator, called OSCAR II, which manages to keep its gaze steadily fixating a target (a dark edge), in spite of nasty thumps that we deliberately gave to its body with a custom-made \"slapping machine\". The robot's agile yaw reactions are based on: (1) a mechanical decoupling of the eye from the body, (2) an active coupling of the robot's heading with its gaze, (3) a Visual Fixation Reflex (VFR), (4) a Vestibulo-Ocular Reflex (VOR), (5) an accurate and fast actuator (voice coil motor, VCM). The actuator is a 2.4-gram voice coil motor that is able to rotate the eye with a rise time as small as 12 ms, that is, much shorter than the rise time of human oculo-motor saccades. In connection with a micro-rate gyro, this actuator endows the robot with a high performance \"vestibulo ocular reflex\" that keeps the gaze locked onto the target whatever perturbations in yaw affect the robot's body. Whenever the robot is destabilized (e.g., by a slap applied on one side), the gaze keeps fixating the target, while being the reference to which the robot's heading is servoed. It then takes the robot only 0.6 s to realign its heading with its gaze.",

        "abstract": "This paper introduces box approximations as a new tool for path planning of closed-loop linkages. Box approximations are finite collections of rectangloids that tightly envelop the robot's free space at a desired resolution. They play a similar role to that of approximate cell decompositions for open-chain robots - they capture the free-space connectivity in a multi-resolutive fashion and yield rectangloid channels enclosing collision-free paths - but have the additional property of enforcing the satisfaction of loop closure constraints frequently arising in articulated linkages. We present an efficient technique to compute such approximations and show how resolution-complete path planners can be devised using them. To the authors' knowledge, this is the first space-decomposition approach to closed-loop linkage path planning proposed in the literature.",

        "abstract": "The greatest characteristic of soft-fingered manipulation is its softness and flexibility during manipulating operations. In previous works, this intrinsic property had been quantitatively explained from the viewpoint of physical and mechanical perspective that the deformation energy induced by large elastic distortion automatically has a minimum equilibrium point. Hence this report first derive equations of motion of two-fingered soft finger robotic hand on the basis of energybased analysis, and explain that an equilibrium point on a combined energy function exists even in the case of manipulating motions by the hand. In this paper, the equilibrium point is called LMEEwC that is unfolded as Local Minimum of Elastic Energy with Constraints. Next, we show that the posture control of a rigid object grasped by the minimal degrees-of-freedom hand can easily be achieved by applying a two-phased controller associated with each joint angle of the hand, which is newly proposed in this report. This control scheme is constructed by two parts: a PD controller with respect to the finger angle and an integral controller with respect to the orientation of the grasped object. The characteristics of the control method of the latter part is that the desired joint angle of the hand is produced dynamically by the integral controller with respect to the object orientation. Finally, we clarify the effectiveness of the proposed control method in the case of the soft-fingered manipulation.",

The approach is inspired by the motor theory and the discovery of mirror neurons, and use motor representations for both reproduction and recognition of speech. A model of the vocal tract is used to create sound and the created sound is then mapped back to the motor representation using a neural network. To learn the map we mimic the behavior of a child that uses a combination of babbling and interaction with its caregiver to learn how to speak. Several different phases of babbling and interaction are identified and described. These help to overcome the inversion problem. The approach has been implemented on a humanoid robot, which has successfully learned to pronounce Swedish and Portuguese vowels. We have also studied how the different phases of babbling and interaction effect the error of the map and the achieved recognition rate when presented with vowels from different subjects. Finally we compare the recognition rates obtained using motor space with recognition rates obtained by directly using the acoustic parameters.",

        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "To ensure the safety of people, it is important that mobile robots operating in populated environments are able to take the motions of humans in their vicinity into account. An especially demanding task in this respect is accompanying a person walking through an unknown and busy environment, because it requires the robot to stay close to his client and simultaneously prevent bumping into any passers-by. This paper presents a local navigation planning approach for collision avoidance, which aims at achieving this goal. The presented technique uses probabilistic roadmaps to plan collision-free paths to a given target location relative to the robot. A laser-based people tracking component is used to estimate the motions of humans in the robot's surrounding, and a potential field method is applied for predicting the humans' future trajectories based on this information. In addition to preventing collisions, the predictions enable us to choose appropriate target locations relative to the person being attended. We tested our method on real robots and in simulations. The experiments carried out in an office environment confirm that the integrated motion prediction actually improves the performance of the collision avoidance and the robot's ability to stay close to the client it accompanies.",

Passive behavior is an important characteristic of a system that provides mobility to elderly or person with walking disability. It allows the user to control the system based on intention. Passive behavior is implemented using imposed desired dynamics, which represents the actual behavior of passive system. This approach uses user intention represented by applied force/torque to derive the mobility aid desired motion. In addition, a guideline in parameter selection of the desired dynamics is also presented. This guideline is used to ensure the stability of the active robotic mobility aid with passive behavior. Experimental results are presented to show the validity of the proposed control method.",

A complete dynamics model, including aspects of orbital mechanics, is incorporated for accurate estimation. Moreover, a discrete-time model of the entire system which includes the state-transition matrix and the covariance of process noise are derived effectively in a closed form, which is essential for the real-time implementation of the Kalman filter. We will show that the translational and rotational measurements are coupled and consequently derive the corresponding observation matrix. The statistical characteristics of the measurement noise is formulated by a state-dependent covariance matrix. This model allows additive quaternion noise, while preserving the unit-norm property of the quaternion. The estimator takes the noisy measurements from a laser vision system with unknown and possibly varying statistical noise properties, and subsequently the estimator adaptively estimates the full sates, i.e., the pose and the velocities, in addition to the covariance of the measurement noise and the inertial parameters of the target satellite. Simulations and experiments conducted will demonstrate the quality performance of the adaptive estimator.",

One of major culprits of the sample impoverishment problem is lack of the number of particles estimating the pose of the robot and the environment. In this work, an adaptive prior boosting technique is proposed for the efficient sample size according to the uncertainty of each situation in performing FastSLAM. It uses a back-propagation neural network, learned in various environments, in order to decide the required sample size. This adaptive approach generates a small number of particles when the uncertainty is low while performing FastSLAM, and it generates a large number of particles when the uncertainty is high. This technique efficiently generates the sample size in computer simulations and real environmental experiments, which significantly reduces the RMS feature and position errors.",

A locally interacting geometric technique provides a unique solution that allows the robots to converge to the uniform distribution by forming an equilateral triangle with their two neighbors. The basic idea underlying the proposed solution is that robots can be thought of as liquid particles that change their relative positions conforming to the shape of the container they occupy. Specifically, it is assumed that robots are not allowed to have the identification number, a pre-determined leader, a common coordinate system, and communication capabilities. Under such minimal conditions, the convergence of the algorithm is mathematically proved and verified through extensive simulations. The results validate the feasibility of applying the algorithm to self-configuration of mobile sensors across the constrained environment.",

This manuscript proposes a systematic design procedure for improving teleoperation fidelity while maintaining its stability in the presence of constant communication delay and dynamic uncertainty. In a two-step control approach, first local Lyapunov-based adaptive/nonlinear controllers linearize the master/slave dynamics. Teleoperation coordination is then achieved by formulating an input/output (I/O) time-delay Hinfin robust control synthesis which is solved via decomposition to adobe problems. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is demonstrated via numerical analysis and experimental results.",

An important thing is that the initial home posture of real robot is slightly different at every setting because a zero position of joint is not exactly the same. Accurate and consistent initial home posture is essential when we compare and analyze walking control algorithms. In general, the conventional method for electric motor uses an incremental encoder with a limit switch or an absolute encoder such as potentiometer to make a zero position. However, this method for the multi-axis humanoid robot is difficult, time-consuming, and inaccurate. Furthermore, it has the disadvantage that additional limit switch or absolute encoder can interfere with the design objective of compactness. This paper describes a novel adjustment method of home posture for a humanoid robot utilizing incremental encoders, an inertial sensor and force torque sensors. Four kinds of controllers are proposed and adjusted offsets are measured when outputs of the controllers are converged. The experimental results from KHR-2 show the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.",

We consider that the robot has previously learned a task independent affordance-based model of its interaction with the world. This model is used to recognize the demonstration by another agent (a human) and infer the task to be learned. We discuss several important problems that arise in this combined framework, such as the influence of an inaccurate model in the recognition of the demonstration. We illustrate the ideas in the paper with some experimental results obtained with a real robot.",

        "abstract": "Recently, on the base of distributed macro-mini actuation approach (DM2), a new robotic manipulator with hybrid actuation, air muscles-DC motor, has been developed. Among existing actuators, the hybrid actuation employs air muscles because they represent an advantageous tradeoff of performance and safety, due to their power/weight ratio and inherent compliance. The air muscles, however, are limited in bandwidth and their behavior is highly nonlinear. In order to overcome these limitations, the paper presents a torque control strategy based on a pair of differentially connected force-controlled air muscles. This controller was implemented and evaluated on a single joint testbed, first by itself and then as macro component into the Macro-Mini control strategy.",

However, rapid motion of internal heart structures limits the realization of these new procedures. This paper investigates the concept of using a single actuator to compensate for tissue motions which occur largely in one direction. We characterize mitral valve annulus motion and show that it is well approximated by a ID model. The subsequent development of a motion-compensating tool (MCT) is described. The resulting instrument was tested in user trials under a series of positional error and tracking delay conditions. Results indicate that the MCT provides an approximately 50% increase in dexterity and 50% decrease in applied force in comparison to a solid tool. The study also shows that MCT tracking efficacy is highly dependent on tracking delays, indicating the importance of predictive, cyclical control algorithms.",

On the basis of an analysis of three possible features, we propose to design a right-angled triangular checkerboard and to employ the invisible intersection points of the laser range finder\u2019s slice plane with the edges of the checkerboard to set up the constraints equations. The extrinsic parameters are then calibrated by minimizing the algebraic errors between the measured intersections points and their corresponding projections on the image plane of the camera. We compared our algorithm with the existing methods by both simulations and the real data of a stereo measurement system. The simulation and experimental results confirmed that the proposed algorithm can yield more accurate results.",

The paper details the systematic modeling procedure for the laser tracing task and elaborates on the task specific choice of two types of task coordinates: feature coordinates, defined with respect to object and feature frames, which facilitate the task specification, and uncertainty coordinates to model geometric uncertainty. Furthermore, the control and estimation scheme for this specific task is studied. Simulation and real world experimental results are presented for the laser tracing example.",

ANSER localization subsystem is composed of a non-differential GPS unit and a laser rangefinder for landmark-based localization (inertial sensors are absent). An augmented state vector approach and an Extended Kalman filter are successfully employed to estimate the colored components in GPS noise, thus getting closer to the conditions for the EKF to be applicable.",

By using only local decision making we can reduce the overhead of our scatternet protocol dramatically. We show how our SNP software layer simplifies a variety of tasks like the synchronization of central pattern generator controllers for actuators, collecting sensory data and building modular robot structures. The whole BT software stack including our new scatternet layer is implemented on a single Bluetooth and memory chip. To verify and characterize the SNP we provide data from experiments using real hardware instead of software simulation. This gives a realistic overview of the scatternet performance showing higher order effects that are difficult to be simulated correctly and guarantees the correct function of the SNP in real world applications.",

        "abstract": "Image-based deformations are generally used for visual tracking of deformable objects moving in the 3D space. For the visual tracking of deformable objects, this assumption has shown to give good results. However it is not satisfying for the visual tracking of 3D rigid objects as the underlying structure cannot be directly estimated. The general belief is that obtaining the 3D structure directly is difficult. In this article, we propose a parameterization that is well adapted either to track deformable objects or to recover the structure of 3D objects. Furthermore, the formulation leads to an efficient implementation that can considerably reduce the computational load and it is therefore more adapted to real-time robotic applications. Experiments with simulated and real data validate the approach for deformable object visual tracking and 3D structure estimation. The computational efficiency is also compared to standard methods.",

        "abstract": "In real-world robotic applications, many factors, both at low-level (e.g., vision and motion control parameters) and at high-level (e.g., the behaviors) determine the quality of the robot performance. Thus, for many tasks, robots require fine tuning of the parameters, in the implementation of behaviors and basic control actions, as well as in strategic decisional processes. In recent years, machine learning techniques have been used to find optimal parameter sets for different behaviors. However, a drawback of learning techniques is time consumption: in practical applications, methods designed for physical robots must be effective with small amounts of data. In this paper, we present a method for concurrent learning of best strategy and optimal parameters, by extending the policy gradient reinforcement learning algorithm. The results of our experimental work in a simulated environment and on a real robot show a very high convergence rate.",

Adaptability and efficiency are the basic considerations for this robot. Based on these concepts, a prototype is designed and fabricated. The proposed adaptive mobile mechanism equipped with one actuator can perform two working modes, a normal working mode and an assistant enhanced mode. Robot under the normal working mode is used for moving in pipe or monitoring the inner surface of the pipe. On the other hand, robot under the assistant enhanced mode will produce a larger torque to help itself surmount an obstacle in the pipe without any other driving actuator. This special feature is achieved by applying a power transmission mechanism. The rotation problem of the stator is solved according to the calculation results of the robot kinematics. Basic experiments have been conducted to testify the adaptability and efficiency of the robot.",

        "abstract": "Human error is the main cause of the many road traffic accidents which every year take the lives of millions of people and injure many more. Driving safety is thus a major concern leading to research in autonomous driving systems. One project at the centre for computational intelligence (C2i), NTU, aims at using fuzzy neural architectures such as GenSoFNN-Yager to realize intelligent driving Le., to learn to autonomously park, make U-turns, drive, and even decide when to change lane, overtake, etc. This paper presents recent work on intelligent speed adaptation and steering control (ISASC), a novel feature of which is the ability to anticipate the road profile and negotiate curves safely. The proposed system was developed and tested on a driving simulator. Experimental results show the robustness of the system in learning from example the desired human driving expertise and applying this knowledge to negotiate new unseen roads.",

        "abstract": "A prototype smart home environment for service robots has been constructed in the research building of Korea Institute of Industrial Technology (KITECH) to demonstrate the feasibility of a robot-assisted future home environment. An inexpensive service robot outfitted with a camera, a Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) reader, and a communication module is installed in the building as a future service robot system which is cheap but robust. In our robotic system, the RFID reader gets the rough location data and object information, and then the robot performs the object recognition scheme to get the exact position of the object in order to grasp it. Due to its concise and unambiguous description of the complex media contents, we adopted MPEG-7 visual descriptors for our object recognition system. In this paper, we propose a fast object recognition system for our smart home environment project, on the basis of MPEG-7 visual descriptors including color and texture. Experimental results show that our proposed system works well with good performance in terms of speed and recognition rate. This object recognition system will be incorporated into our mobile robotics platform and a shape descriptor is to be included in the next version of our object recognition system.",

We propose three step modules for generating stable walking pattern based on zero moment point(ZMP) and linear inverted pendulum model. The proposed step module uses both the characteristics of periodicity and the least square method in order to reduce the fluctuation range of the ZMP trajectory according to various footprints. In order to implement it, the trajectory of the desired ZMP is designed with the quartic polynomials. This method is more insensitive to variation of the walking pattern owing to the initial value of the ZMP and CoM and various walking step length. And it makes more efficient trajectory of CoM on account of the slope of ZMP in the single support phase. The effectiveness of the propose method is verified by simulation.",

Motion captured data are recorded during natural dialogue, and the rotation angles are estimated from the head marker data. Analysis results showed that nods frequently occur during speech utterances, not only for expressing specific dialog acts such as agreement and affirmation, but also as indicative of syntactic or semantic units, appearing at the last syllable of the phrases, in strong phrase boundaries. Analyses are also conducted on the dependence on linguistic, prosodic and voice quality information of other head motions, like shakes and tilts, and discuss about the potentiality for their use in automatic generation of head motions. The paper also proposes a method for controlling the head actuators of an android based on the rotation angles, and evaluates the mapping from the human head motions.",

Previous studies by Omata and Nagata showed that there is a constraint on static friction forces, which is derived from contact kinematics, in rigid-body power grasps. The set of possible contact forces can be calculated using the constraint. This approach can be applied to not only mechanical analysis of power grasps but also that of other robotic contact tasks. However, there are some cases where Omata and Nagata\u2019s formulation generates paradoxical results on contact forces. In this paper, we investigate this problem and propose a modified method to calculate the set of possible indeterminate contact forces. We also study how to reduce the computation.",

        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "Particle filters are a frequently used filtering technique in the robotics community. They have been successfully applied to problems such as localization, mapping, or tracking. The particle filter framework allows the designer to freely choose the proposal distribution which is used to obtain the next generation of particles in estimating dynamical processes. This choice greatly influences the performance of the filter. Many approaches have achieved good performance through informed proposals which explicitly take into account the current observation. A popular approach is to approximate the desired proposal distribution by a Gaussian. This paper presents a statistical analysis of the quality of such Gaussian approximations. We also propose a way to obtain the optimal proposal in a non-parametric way and then identify the error introduced by the Gaussian approximation. Furthermore, we present an alternative sampling strategy that better deals with situations in which the target distribution is multi-modal. Experimental results indicate that our alternative sampling strategy leads to accurate maps more frequently that the Gaussian approach while requiring only minimal additional computational overhead.",

This joint mechanism, which is called a loosely coupled mechanism, includes a viscoelastic object and soft actuators in place of the cartilage and muscles of a human arm. To confirm motion of the link using one length sensor, we constructed a prototype of the mechanism in two-dimensional (2D) space. Based on this prototype, we constructed a 3D loosely coupled mechanism with length sensors, and we were able to control two projecting angles of the 3D prototype. In addition, we propose an appropriate method of measurement to reduce errors in measurement due to the length sensors. Using this method, we found that, for each projecting plane, the errors were less than 1.0 deg in our 3D prototype.",

A key feature is that the legged locomotion robots developed in this paper have no joints. In other words, the FFP actuators that become the robot legs (links) can directly generate power by their deflections. In addition, the assembly time of the FFP actuators is short due to their simple structure. After investigating the fundamental properties of the FFP actuators, we propose ten types of FFP\u2013actuators that are available for assembling a wide variety of legged locomotion robots. Two\u2013legged and four\u2013legged locomotion robots developed in this paper realize walking by transferring the elastic potential energy (generated by deflections of the FFP actuators) to kinematic energy. We demonstrate that the leg displacement can be controlled by adjusting the deflection of the FFP actuators with simple ON\u2013OFF signals.",

Most of the existing techniques focus mainly on determining the most likely map and leave open how to efficiently compute the marginal covariances. These marginal covariances, however, are essential for solving the data association problem. In this paper we present a novel algorithm for computing an approximation of the marginal. In experiments we demonstrate that our approach outperforms two commonly used techniques, namely loopy belief propagation and belief propagation on a spanning tree. Compared to these approaches, our algorithm yields better estimates while preserving the same time complexity.",

The dynamic gait then becomes always asymptotically stable around the equilibrium points, and this is shown by a simple recurrence formula of the pre-impact kinetic energy. The validity of the method is numerically confirmed via gait generation by virtual passive dynamic walking.",

        "abstract": "The purpose of this research is to develop techniques that enable robots to choose and track a desired person for interaction in daily-life environments. Therefore, localizing multiple moving sounds and human faces is necessary so that robots can locate a desired person. For sound source localization, we used a cross-power spectrum phase analysis (CSP) method and showed that CSP can localize sound sources only using two microphones and does not need impulse response data. An expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm was shown to enable a robot to cope with multiple moving sound sources. For face localization, we developed a method that can reliably detect several faces using the skin color classification obtained by using the EM algorithm. To deal with a change in color state according to illumination condition and various skin colors, the robot can obtain new skin color features of faces detected by OpenCV, an open vision library, for detecting human faces. Finally, we developed a probability based method to integrate auditory and visual information and to produce a reliable tracking path in real time. Furthermore, the developed system chose and tracked people while dealing with various background noises that are considered loud, even in the daily-life environments.",

        "abstract": "This paper presents a novel automated manufacturing process for mass production of nano devices from advanced material such as carbon nanotubes (CNTs). CNTs have been found to be a promising and advanced material for nanoelectronics due to their size and excellent mechanical and electrical properties. Conventional electronic devices replaced by CNT are possibly to be miniaturized, and CNT based nano devices can provide better performance. Therefore, researchers have focused on developing different methods to manufacture CNT based nano devices in recent years. Since the size of CNTs is in nano scale, traditional robotic manipulation cannot be applied. Electrical assembly of CNT based devices is one of the promising methods to manipulate CNT to desired position. Building nano device by a single CNT is challenging, therefore, most people have concentrated on manipulating bundled CNTs. However, the electrical properties of bundled CNTs are difficult to control. As a result, device cannot benefit from quantum properties of a single CNT. Therefore, an automated process for manufacturing single CNT based nano devices is necessary for this application. A CNT deposition system is developed to manipulate a single CNT across microelectrodes precisely and repeatedly by using dielectrophoresis (DEP). Moreover, certain types of CNTs can be selected by using a micro chamber to filter other unnecessary types of CNTs. The system can potentially be used to fabricate an array of CNT based devices, and a fast and feasible batch nano assembly of consistent nano devices can be achieved.",

While noteworthy results have been achieved with respect to off-line training process for appearance-based navigation, novel issues arise when recognition and learning are simultaneous and unsupervised processes. The approach adopted here uses a Gaussian mixture model estimated by a novel incremental MML-EM to model the probability distribution of features extracted by image-preprocessing. A place detector decides which features belong to which place integrating odometric information and a hidden Markov model. Tests demonstrate that the proposed system performs as well as the ones relying on batch off-line environmental learning.",

In this type of interventions the patient body is accessed by inserting especial instruments through small incisions. As these instruments are manipulated by robotic assistants, passive wrists are incorporated for free compliance with the port of entry. With this wrist configuration it is only possible to locate accurately an instrument tip if its port of entry or fulcrum point is known. A vision oriented method is proposed in this paper to estimate the position of this external point of incision. It is based on motion analysis in a sequence of images where geometric properties of projected features and 3D transformations of the instrument are related. In this work we show that it is possible to accurately estimate the position and orientation of this 3D point, as well as the orientation of the instrument with respect to the laparoscopic camera applying determined movements through the robotic assistant.",

        "abstract": "This paper presents the intelligent and automatic application developed in order to assembly ceramic mosaics. The application consists on given an image with different objects (representing real tiles) and a vectorial image design of a ceramic tile mosaic, the application recognizes in a qualitative way which tile in the image belongs to the mosaic design and indicates its position and rotational angle in order that a robot arm places it in the correct position of the mosaic design. In order to implement this application two developments are needed and here presented: first a qualitative shape matching theory has been developed in order to be able to recognize shapes, and then a hybrid method (using quantitative and qualitative techniques) has been also developed in order to obtain the relevant features of an image. These relevant features are needed for their use in the qualitative shape matching theory. The qualitative shape matching theory considers qualitatively their angles, relative side length, concavities and convexities of the boundary and color. The shapes recognized are regular and non-regular closed polygons that can have curve segments and curvilinear shapes. Moreover the shapes can contain holes. Each object is described by a string containing its qualitative distinguish features, which is used to match the object against others.",

        "abstract": "In this paper, we present an approach that applies the reinforcement learning principle to the problem of learning height control policies for aerial blimps. In contrast to previous approaches, our method does not require sophisticated hand- tuned models, but rather learns the policy online, which makes the system easily adaptable to changing conditions. The blimp we apply our approach to is a small-scale vehicle equipped with an ultrasound sensor that measures its elevation relative to the ground. The major problem in the context of learning control policies lies in the high-dimensional state-action space that needs to be explored in order to identify the values of all state-action pairs. In this paper, we propose a solution to learning continuous control policies based on the Gaussian process model. In practical experiments carried out on a real robot we demonstrate that the system is able to learn a policy online within a few minutes only.",

        "abstract": "In this paper, we describe the implementation of a precise reaching controller on an upper-torso humanoid robot. The solution we propose does not rely on prior models of the kinematic structure of either the arm or the head. A learning strategy enables the robot to acquire the required sensory-motor transformations. After learning the robot is able to precisely reach for a visually identified object in the 3-dimensional space. In this technique we use the fixation point (represented in the head joints motor space) as a reference frame to code the position of the object and to represent the eye-to-hand Jacobian matrix. This strategy successfully deals with the kinematic redundancy of the structure and constraints the dimensionality of the problem.",

        "abstract": "In this paper, we investigate autonomous robot- assisted insertion of an active catheter instrumented with shape memory alloy (SMA) actuators using image guidance. An Augmented Hybrid Impedance Control (AHIC) algorithm is implemented on a Mitsubishi robot (PA 10-7C) to insert the active catheter. The robot is constrained to move in Cartesian space along a pre-defined trajectory while controlling the force of insertion. A closed-loop control scheme has been developed to accurately control the bending in the active catheter. The tip of the active catheter is tracked in real-time to provide information on the path of the catheter and for determining the future course of insertion. The catheter is autonomously guided from the point of entry to the site of plaque buildup, thereby shielding the surgeon from the harmful radiation due to the X-rays used for imaging, providing a more ergonomic approach for catheter insertion. Experimental results are given to illustrate the robot-assisted catheter insertion procedure.",

This approach, applied to a quadrotor unmanned aerial vehicle, differs from standard backstepping in that the virtual control inputs are designed based on estimates of the previous virtual control inputs. This eliminates the need to take derivatives of the system dynamics, which simplifies the control law. The estimation design is based on the exact second-order sliding mode differentiator. The controller objective is to achieve good tracking of desired positions and yaw angle while keeping the stability of the pitch and roll angles. The design methodology is based on the Lyapunov stability. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.",

In previous work, a rollover indicator devoted to light ATVs, accounting for these phenomena has been proposed. It is based on the prediction of the lateral load transfer. Such an indicator requires the online knowledge of the tire cornering stiffness, initially selected from a ground classes network. In this paper, an adapted backstepping observer, making only use of yaw rate measurement, is designed to improve specifically tire cornering stiffness estimation. Capabilities of such an observer are demonstrated and discussed through both advanced simulations and actual experiments.",

The manipulator is equipped with multiple linkages and a balloon to support the fetus softly in the uterus. The linkages with two bending mechanisms are designed for inserting the balloon to an optimal position under the fetus. The balloon is fold before the operation and inflated by saline water after arriving at the required position in the uterus. Accuracy evaluation showed that the standard deviations of the bending angle of the wire-driven mechanism and the linkages-driven mechanism were 1.0 degree and 2.5 degree, respectively. Force experiment showed that the balloon-type stabilizer could generate load-bearing power of 500 gf. Furthermore, the manipulator could be well controlled with guidance of ultrasound images. The manipulator could minimize injure to the fetus since the area contacted with the fetus by the balloon could be well controlled.",

The problems addressed are an adherability on a rough surface, which is comes from the seal action of a liquid, and low friction between suction cup and adhered rough and smooth surfaces which is comes form lubricating action of a liquid. Generally, it is difficult that a vacuumed suction cup adheres on rough surface such concrete plate and hardly slidable. In this paper, the adhesion force and friction when a suction cup adheres on smooth glass plate and concrete plate are measured and compared wet condition with dry condition. The experiment result showed that a viscosity is important at the sealing performance of adhesion on rough surface. The silicon oil of a viscosity of 5000cSt allows a suction cup to adhere on concrete surface. In this condition it comes up to the adhesion force when a suction cup adheres on smooth glass with dry condition.",

        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "The last years have witnessed a significant increase in the percentage of old and disabled people. Members of this population group very often require extensive help for performing daily tasks like moving around or grasping objects. Unfortunately, assistive technology is not always available to people needing it. For instance, steering a wheelchair can represent an extremely fatiguing or simply impossible task to many elderly or disabled users. Most of the existing assistance platforms try to help users without considering their specific needs. However, driving performance may vary considerably across users due to different pathologies or just due to temporary effects like fatigue. Therefore, we propose in this paper a user adapted shared control approach aimed at helping users in driving a power wheelchair. Adaption to the user is achieved by estimating the user's true intent out of potentially noisy steering signals before assisting him/her. The user's driving performance is explicitly modeled in order to recognize the user's intention or plan together with the uncertainty on it. Safe navigation is achieved by merging the potentially noisy input of the user with fine motion trajectories computed online by a 3D planner. Encouraging results on assisting a user who cannot steer to the left are reported on K.U.Leuven's intelligent wheelchair Sharioto.",

        "abstract": "To autonomously navigate on rough terrain is a challenging problem for mobile robots, requiring the ability to decide whether parts of the environment can be traversed or have to be bypassed, which is commonly known as Obstacle Negotiation (ON). In this paper, we introduce a planning framework that extends ON to the general case, where different types of terrain classes directly map to specific robot skills, such as climbing stairs and ramps. This extension is based on a new concept called behavior maps, which is utilized for the planning and execution of complex skills. Behavior maps are directly generated from elevation maps, i.e. two-dimensional grids storing in each cell the corresponding height of the terrain surface, and a set of skill descriptions. Results from extensive experiments are presented, showing that the method enables the robot to explore successfully rough terrain in real-time, while selecting the optimal trajectory in terms of costs for navigation and skill execution.",

        "abstract": "We present a robot localization system using biologically-inspired vision. Our system models two extensively studied human visual capabilities: (1) extracting the \"gist\" of a scene to produce a coarse localization hypothesis, and (2) refining it by locating salient landmark regions in the scene. Gist is computed here as a holistic statistical signature of the image, yielding abstract scene classification and layout. Saliency is computed as a measure of interest at every image location, efficiently directing the time-consuming landmark identification process towards the most likely candidate locations in the image. The gist and salient landmark features are then further processed using a Monte-Carlo localization algorithm to allow the robot to generate its position. We test the system in three different outdoor environments - building complex (126times180 ft. area, 3794 testing images), vegetation-filled park (270times360 ft. area, 7196 testing images), and open-field park (450times585 ft. area, 8287 testing images) - each with its own challenges. The system is able to localize, on average, within 6.0, 10.73, and 32.24 ft., respectively, even with multiple kidnapped-robot instances.",

        "abstract": "A novel control strategy of pan-tilt-zoom camera is described. Because the active camera is mounted on a moving autonomous helicopter in visual tracking system, and the tracked object is moving at same time, and there exists the vibration influence of the helicopter, image stabilization becomes poor, and all pixels are running. Therefore, a biomimetic control strategy of on-board pan-tilt-zoom camera is presented. In this paper, the biomimetic oculomotor control model is obtained based on physiological neural path of eye movement control. In order to validate the functions of the biomimetic control model, simulation experiments were done under the same condition as the physiological experiments in physiological researches. Then the biomimetic controller of onboard pan-tilt-zoom camera is developed. The results of flight tracking experiments show that the biomimetic controller can compensate the deflection caused by the flight platform, and enhance the visual tracking system performance.",

Recently, Asano et al. applied this principle to a biped robot with telescopic-legs, and succeeded in generating a sustainable biped gait by computer simulation. In this paper, we deal with a model of a biped robot that has not only semicircular feet but also actuated knees. Though this robot has no actuator at the hip, knee actuators can sustain gait by parametric excitation. We first verify that an actuated knee can cause parametric excitation, and then show by computer simulation that the proposed biped robot can walk continuously with actuated knees only.",

        "abstract": "This paper presents an algorithm for adapting periodic behavior to gradual shifts in task parameters. Since learning optimal control in high dimensional domains is subject to the 'curse of dimensionality', we parametrize the policy only along the limit cycle traversed by the gait, and thus focus the computational effort on a closed one-dimensional manifold, embedded in the high-dimensional state space. We take an initial gait as a departure point, and iterate between modifying the task slightly, and adapting the gait to this modification. This creates a sequence of gaits, each optimized for a different variant of the task. Since every two gaits in this sequence are very similar, the whole sequence spans a two-dimensional manifold, and combining all policies in this 2-manifold provides additional robustness to the system. We demonstrate our approach on two simulations of bipedal robots - the compass gait walker, which is a four-dimensional system, and RABBIT, which is ten-dimensional. The walkers' gaits are adapted to a sequence of changes in the ground slope, and when all policies in the sequence are combined, the walkers can safely traverse a rough terrain, where the incline changes at every step.",

        "abstract": "This paper describes a robot calibration approach called the virtual closed kinematic chain (ViCKi) method. Traditionally, calibration requires the measurement of the position and orientation of the end effector, and measurement resolution limits the accuracy of the robot model. In ViCKi, we attach a laser to the end effector to create a virtual 7th link. The laser spot produced on a distant plane, the end of this virtual link, magnifies small changes at the end effector, resulting in a high resolution error measurement of the end effector. The accuracy of the robot after using the proposed calibration procedure is measured by aiming at an arbitrary fixed point and measuring the mean and standard deviation of the radius of spread of the projected points. The mean and standard deviation of the radius of spread were improved from 5.64mm and 1.89mm to 1.05mm and 0.587mm respectively. It is also shown in simulation that the method can be automated by a feedback system that can be implemented in real-time.",

        "abstract": "In order to search and rescue the victims in rubble effectively, a 3D map of the rubble is required. As a part of the national project of rescue robot system, we are investigating a method for constructing a 3D map of rubble by teleoperated mobile robots. In previous work, we have developed the second prototype of laser range finder for rubble measurement. The prototype laser range finder consists of a ring laser beam module and two omni-vision cameras. Also, the third prototype, which is more compact than the second one, is newly developed. Our range finder has the features that the omni-directional distance around the range finder can be measured at once and the omni-directional picture image can be captured at the same time. The measurement accuracy of the sensor depends on the adjustment of some parameters. Although we were adjusting the parameters manually so far, this adjustment requires much time and effort. However, it is difficult for manual adjustment to derive fine measurement accuracy. Then, we developed a calibration system which adjusts the parameters using a Genetic Algorithm. In this paper, the third prototype laser range finder and the calibration system are described. The calibration method of the parameters for the laser range finder is also described. The calibration system makes it possible to adjust the parameters easily. Results of calibration by using the constructed calibration system show the availability of the system.",

        "abstract": "The two main categories of deformable models used in surgical simulators are Mass Spring Models (MSM) and Finite Element Models (FEM). Mass spring models are often preferred due to their simplicity and low computational cost and because they allow to perform topology changes on the modeled body without significant computational overhead. The principal drawback of the mass spring model is the need of complex calibration procedure since they don't have a clear physical meaning. In this paper we propose a new method to calibrate mass spring models. Our method uses CAT data to identify mass values and deformation measures to define elastic coefficient and damping ratio for the springs of the model. Spring parameters are obtained through a genetic algorithm that minimizes the difference between the model and the measured behavior. The algorithm we developed to compute the masses was tested with medical CAT data whereas the spring algorithm correctness was tested with synthetic models. Simulation verifications are presented.",

By taking into account the midfield line which passes through the center circle\u2019 center, a novel camera calibration method using the images of the midfield is proposed in this paper. A point at infinity can be determined from the center circle and the midfield line using the pole-polar relationship. The image of a point at infinity is called a vanishing point. The image of a circle is called a circle image in this paper. From one circle image and one coplanar vanishing point, a cubic constraint on the IAC can be obtained. The degenerate cases are discussed, and some applications are given in this paper.",

By just looking at the scene they can decide which places or objects they can easily reach and which are difficult to approach. Possessing a similar abstraction of a robot arm's capabilities in its workspace is important for grasp planners, path planners and task planners. In this paper, we show that robot arm capabilities manifest themselves as directional structures specific to workspace regions. We introduce a representation scheme that enables to visualize and inspect the directional structures. The directional structures are then captured in the form of a map, which we name the capability map. Using this capability map, a manipulator is able to deduce places that are easy to reach. Furthermore, a manipulator can either transport an object to a place where versatile manipulation is possible or a mobile manipulator or humanoid torso can position itself to enable optimal manipulation of an object.",

The only sensor of the robot is a digital camera oriented to the ceiling of the map, which is used to approximate the Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) problem. We have divided the algorithm into two steps: (i) action estimation, which approximates the actions of the robot maximizing the Mutual Information between consecutive views; and (ii) global rectification, which rectifies the drift of the global trajectory minimizing the entropy of the map. Moreover, a fisheye lens is used to recover enough information from ceilings, reducing their inherent ambiguity. Such lenses produce a semi-spherical aberration in the images, that must be rectified using some information about calibration. In order to do so, we propose a novel technique for image rectification, also based on Information Theory. Finally, we present some experimental results using real data, that prove the robustness of the method.",

In this work, optimality is defined in terms of the worst case relative manipulability index. While this approach is applicable to both serial and parallel mechanisms, it is especially applicable to parallel mechanisms with a limited workspace. It is shown that a previously derived inequality for the worst case relative manipulability index is generally not achieved for fully spatial manipulators and that the concept of optimal fault tolerance to multiple failures is more subtle than previously indicated. Lastly, the authors identify the class of eight degree-of-freedom Gough-Stewart platforms that are optimally fault tolerant for up to two locked joint failures. Examples of optimally fault tolerant seven and eight degree-of-freedom mechanisms are presented.",

        "abstract": "Stimuli-responsive polymers and gels have been applied to biomimetic actuators or artificial muscles. Biomimetic robots using such materials can move like a living creature. Especially, electroactive polymers are said to be promising materials as advanced soft actuators. Its mechanical motion is controlled by external stimuli such as a change in solvent composition, pH, temperature and electric field etc. On the other hand, many living organisms generate an autonomous motion without external driving stimuli. In this paper, we report a novel biomimetic gel actuator that can bend and stretch with worm-like motion spontaneously without external driving stimuli. The gel actuator converts the chemical energy of oscillating reaction, i.e., the Belouzov-Zhabotinsky (BZ) reaction into the kinetic energy inside the gel. Although the gel is completely composed of synthetic polymer, it shows autonomous motion as if it is alive. To cause anisotropic contraction with curvature changes, the gel strip with gradient structure was prepared. Furthermore, the gel can walk with repeated bending and stretching motion by itself like a looper by coupling with ratchet mechanism. The \"self-walking\" gel actuator will create a new framework of biomimetic chemical robot.",

        "abstract": "Audio-visual speech recognition (AVSR) is a promising approach to improve noise robustness of speech recognition in the real world. A phoneme and a viseme are used as an auditory and visual unit for AVSR, respectively. However, in the real world, they are often misclassified due to additional input noises. To solve this problem, we propose two approaches. One is audio-visual integration based on missing feature theory to cope with missing or unreliable audio and visual features for recognition. The other is a biologically-inspired approach, that is, phoneme and viseme grouping based on coarse-to-fine recognition. Preliminary experiments show that audio-visual speech recognition based on these approaches improves the noise robustness of AVSR drastically.",

These structures can (1) exactly match arbitrary user-specified designs, (2) adapt their shape to immovable obstacles, or (3) form a wall of given minimum width around an environmental feature. These three possibilities span the range from entirely prespecified structures to those whose shape is entirely determined by the environment. Robots require no explicit communication, instead using information storage capabilities of environmental elements (a form of \"extended stigmergy\") to coordinate their activities. We provide theoretical proof of the correctness of the algorithms for the first two types of structures, and experimental support for algorithms for the third.",

Instead of simulating the swing trajectories and checking for collisions along them, our approach uses machine learning techniques to predict whether a swing trajectory is collision-free. Using a set of local terrain features, we apply supervised learning to train a classifier to predict collisions. Both in simulation and on a real quadruped platform, our results show that our classifiers can improve the accuracy of collision detection compared to a real-time geometric approach without significantly increasing the computation time.",

In order to realize the coordination, robots have to behave as not only followers but also leaders when they execute tasks with humans. As an example of the advanced human-robot coordination systems, a male-type dance partner robot is developed, which behaves as a male dancer and executes ballroom dances with a human. In ballroom dances, a male dancer leads a female dancer, and selects the next step based on the information such as the relative position between themselves and other dance couples, their positions in the dance floor, and so on. This paper addresses the step selection problems, which contains collision avoidances with other dance couples. Hidden Markov models are used to estimate their dance step trajectories. Experiments and simulations are performed to illustrate the validity of the proposed method.",

The main idea is to create an occupancy grid that moves along with the vehicle and extract features into a fixed global map. Vice versa, global features or a-priori knowledge can be inserted into the grid. The maps are calculated onboard to be used for autonomous behavior like path planning and obstacle avoidance. With the described method, maps are created and updated in real-time, and due to its flexibility, the vehicle is not restricted to a pre-defined area. The developed approach has been demonstrated in flights with a small unmanned helicopter.",

        "abstract": "Two novel methods for computing 3D structure information from video for a piecewise planar scene are presented. The first method is based on a new line constraint, which clearly separates the estimation of distance from the estimation of slant. The second method exploits the concepts of phase correlation to compute from the change of image frequencies of a textured plane, distance and slant information. The two different estimates together with structure estimates from classical image motion are combined and integrated over time using an extended Kalman filter. The estimation of the scene structure is demonstrated experimentally in a motion control algorithm that allows the robot to move along a corridor. We demonstrate the efficacy of each individual method and their combination and show that the method allows for visual navigation in textured as well as un-textured environments.",

The locomotion concept is based on an adapted magnetic wheel unit integrating two lateral lever arms. These arms allow for slightly lifting off the wheel in order to locally decrease the magnetic force, as well as laterally stabilizing the wheel unit. The robot has the main advantage to be compact and mechanically simple. It features 5 active degrees of freedom: 2 driven wheels each equipped with an active lifter-stabilizer and 1 steering unit. This paper also presents the design and implementation of a prototype robot and its high mobility is shown. It is able to pass 90deg convex and concave obstacles with any inclination regarding the gravity. Finally, it only requires limited space to maneuver, since turning on spot around the rear wheel is possible.",

        "abstract": "One might expect that after nearly 50 years of research in robot manipulation and mobile robotics the architectural design of robot systems has converged to a small set of best practice solutions, very much like in the area of operating systems, where the world is dominated by less then a handful systems. Quite the opposite is the case. It is only a small overstatement to say that almost every lab has brewed its own solution for robot control architecture, middleware and software integration concepts. One reason for this situation is the fact that the complexity and variety of systems and applications has grown considerably since then leading to a diversity of approaches. Another reason is clearly the lack of any sound methodology to measures and compare architectural designs. This article tries to address the problem by proposing a comparison and evaluation methodology for robotics software systems. The methodology facilitates an assessment of software systems through experimentation and takes into account the possible operational profile and quality attribute requirements of the robotic application. The approach is validated through the evaluation of three software systems, i.e. GenoM, ORCA2 and GO. The results suggest possible applicability domains of each system and show the efficiency of the approach.",

        "abstract": "In robot-assisted surgery, surgical tools interact with tissues that have nonlinear mechanical properties. For situations where a pre-specified trajectory of tool positions (or applied forces) is desired, there are many controller designs that might be used. Four candidates are comparatively evaluated here, via computer simulation involving a nonlinear model of soft tissue behavior during grasping actions. The parameters for this model were obtained experimentally (in earlier work). The four candidate controllers are: (1) a well- tuned PID controller; (2) feedback linearization in combination with deadbeat control; (3) an optimal open-loop control law obtained via minimization of a quadratic cost function; and (4) a model predictive controller. Simulation trials are used to compare the transient performance of these candidate controllers under different assumptions regarding input and output noises. The conditions where each of the candidates is best are characterized.",

        "abstract": "Object immobilization is important to robot hand grasping and to many manufacturing processes. A huge number of existing papers considered issues such as the analysis of grasps, the existence of immobilizing grasps for various classes of objects, and the synthesis of immobilizing grasps for twoand three-dimensional objects. However, no algorithm has been proposed to efficiently enumerate all form-closure grasps for any class of three-dimensional objects. As an initial step towards a general solution to this complex problem, we propose the first efficient algorithm for computing all form-closure grasps of a rectilinear polyhedron. Our approach is based on a decomposition of the original problem in the abstract sixdimensional wrench space into closely related subproblems in three-dimensional subspaces, and a subsequent transformation of these subproblems into two-color intersection problems on planar screens in these spaces. We then use techniques from computational geometry to efficiently solve the planar intersection problems. The resulting algorithm reports all K sets of six to seven faces of a rectilinear polyhedron that yield at least one form-closure grasp in O(n2K\u2032log4 n + K) time, where n is the number of the faces, and K\u2032 is the size of an intermediate output. We show that K = \u03a9 (n2K\u2032) in the worst case.",

As a way towards this ambitious goal, this paper presents a recognition algorithm able to measure its own level of confidence and, in case of uncertainty, to seek for extra information so to increase its own knowledge and ultimately achieve better performance. We focus on the visual place recognition problem for topological localization, and we take an SVM approach. We propose a new method for measuring the confidence level of the classification output, based on the distance of a test image and the average distance of training vectors. This method is combined with a discriminative accumulation scheme for cue integration. We show with extensive experiments that the resulting algorithm achieves better performances for two visual cues than the classic single cue SVM on the same task, while minimising the computational load. More important, our method provides a reliable measure of the level of confidence of the decision.",

        "abstract": "The concept of C-space entropy for sensor-based exploration and view planning for general robot-sensor systems has been introduced in [?], [?], [?], [?]. The robot plans the next sensing action (also called the next best view) to maximize the expected C-space entropy reduction, (known as Maximal expected Entropy Reduction, or MER). It gives priority to those areas that increase the maneuverable space around the robot, taking into account its physical size and shape, thereby facilitating reachability for further views. However, previous work had assumed a Poisson point process model for obstacle distribution in the physical space, a simplifying assumption. In this paper we derive an expression for MER criterion assuming an occupancy grid map, a commonly used representation for workspace representation in much of the mobile robot community. This model is easily obtained from typical range sensors such as laser range finders, stereo vision, etc., and furthermore, we can incorporate occlusion constraints and their effect in the MER formulation, making it more realistic. Simulations show that even for holonomic mobile robots with relatively simple geometric shapes (such as a rectangle), the MER criterion yields improvement in exploration efficiency (number of views needed to explore the C-space) over physical space based criteria.",

First, a traditional maximum a posterior (MAP) parameter estimate is used to achieve regularization based on conjugate priors. Next, a model order selection criterion is derived from Bayesian-Laplace approaches such that the conjugate prior distribution can be used to measure the uncertainty in the estimated parameters. As a result, the proposed learning method avoids the possibility of convergence toward local minima in the parameter space, and is also capable of selecting the optimal order for a GMM using an additional complexity penalty for the prior distribution. The proposed method is applied to electromyogram (EMG) pattern recognition for controlling a multifunction myoelectric hand, and experiments conducted to recognize nine kinds of hand motion from EMG signals for ten subjects. In conclusion, the proposed learning method effectively estimated the change of feature vectors according to the subject and the GMM classifier demonstrated a high recognition accuracy.",

This paper clarifies how to integrate existing methods to implement a robust and efficient solver. Virtual spring-damper joints are proposed to simulate a shock absorbing mechanism that many biped humanoid robots have in their feet to increase the stability of walking motion. The combination of the rigid contact model and the elastic virtual joints can improve the accuracy of the simulation.

In this paper, we propose a scheme of generating a hybrid visual map based on the visual plane framework. The hybrid visual map has two levels of map representations: 1) absolute map representation of distinctive visual planes via EKF-SLAM and 2) relative map representation of dense visual features for each visual plane via sparse information filter update. It can inherit the advantages of the visual plane by maintaining the absolute map. Moreover, the relative map can reconstruct a 3-D map of visual features efficiently without loosing dense visual information. The performance of the proposed method was verified by the experimental results of consistent hybrid visual maps in two real indoor environments.",

        "abstract": "This paper discusses a simulation model of flying robots (developed in our previous paper) with a variable attack angle mechanism. The simulation model constructed in this paper are divided into three parts. The first part is a socalled attack angle model to compute the change of angle of attack. The second part is a so-called lift force model to compute lift force based on the computational result from the first part. In the second part, we compensate lift and drag coefficients with aero dynamical (experimental) data in previous studies on pitching (motion) wing since the variable attack angle mechanism realizes a pitching motion. The third part is a socalled power model to compute the electrical power of motors. The utility of the simulation model is verified by comparing simulation results with experimental results.",

        "abstract": "Planetary missions generate a large quantity of image data. In flight operations or on servers such as Planetary Data Systems (PDS) these data products are only searchable by keys such as the Sol, spacecraft clock, or rover motion counter index, with little connection to the semantic content of the images. During mission science operations the science team typically pores over each and every data product returned, which may not require more sophisticated organization and search tools. However, for analyzing existing image databases with thousands or millions of images, manual searching, matching, or classification is intractable. In this paper, we present a method for matching images based on similarities in visual texture. For every image in a database, a series of filters are used to compute the response to localized frequencies and orientations. Filter responses are turned into a low dimensional descriptor vector, generating a 37 dimensional fingerprint. At query time, fingerprints are quickly matched to find images with similar appearance. Image databases containing several thousand images are pre-processed offline in a matter of hours. Image matches from the database are found in a matter of seconds. We have demonstrated this image matching technique using three sources of data and carried out user tests to evaluate matching performance by hand labeling results. User tests verify approximately 40 % false positive rate within the top 14 matches. This represents a powerful search tool for databases of thousands of images where the a priori match probability for an image might be less than 1%.",

This approach relies on three elements: (i) a minimal-complexity classifier for performing fast coarse localization (submap classification); (ii) an optimized saliency detector which exploits the visual statistics of the submap; and (iii) a fast view-matching algorithm which filters initial matchings with a structural criterion. The latter algorithm yields fine localization. Our experiments show that these elements have been successfully integrated for solving the global localization problem. Context, that is, the awareness of being in a particular submap, is defined by a supervised classifier tuned for a minimal set of features. Visual context is exploited both for tuning (optimizing) the saliency detection process, and to select potential matching views in the visual database, close enough to the query view.",

Periodic smoothing splines are used by a robot to approximate the contour of encountered obstacles in the environment. The splines are generated through minimizing a cost function subject to constraints imposed by a linear control system and accuracy is improved iteratively using a recursive spline algorithm. The filtering effect of the smoothing splines allows for usage of noisy sensor data and the method is robust to odometry drift. Experimental evaluation is performed for contour reconstruction of three objects using a SICK laser scanner mounted on a PowerBot from ActivMedia Robotics.",

An optimal high-order sliding mode control via state-dependent Riccati equation approach is introduced providing a robustness of motion control including elimination of chattering effect for decoupled systems of an AUV. Motion planning for a docking is introduced. The average vector field based on an artificial potential field method gives a desired trajectory using existing information from ocean network sensors. It provides a guidance for an AUV to follow the path to a required position with final desired orientation. A Line-of-Sight method is used for an AUV to follow the predefined path. In order to improve a docking manoeuver, a switched weight technique is proposed for controlling a vehicle\u2019s path and final stage docking.",

        "abstract": "The performance index in teleoperation, transparency, is often defined as linear scaling of force and position between the master/operator and slave/environment. Motivated by applications involving soft tissue manipulation such as robotic surgery, the transparency objective is generalized to include monotonic nonlinear mappings between the master/slave position and force signals. To demonstrate the utility of such performance index, an enhanced sensitivity non-linear force mapping design is proposed that can improve stiffness discrimination in telemanipulation tasks. The mapping design is validated using adaptive psychophysics perception experiments. Lyapunov-based adaptive motion/force controllers are presented that can guarantee the convergence of position and force tracking errors in the presence of dynamic uncertainty. Given a priori known bounds on the unknown operator/environment parameters, the robust stability of the proposed teleoperation system is analyzed using an off-axis circle criterion and the Nyquist envelope of interval plant systems. Experimental results with a two-axis teleoperation setup are provided.",

The HITL platform incorporates a nonlinear dynamic model of the USSV, emulation of sensors and instrumentation onboard the USSV, and the actual hardware and software components used for control of the USSV in the experimental testbed. Detailed models of hydrodynamic effects, actuators including thrusters/propellers and control surfaces, and disturbances including ocean currents, waves, and wind are included in the dynamic simulation. The fidelity of the developed HITL simulator is demonstrated through comparisons with experimental data collected from a USSV. We also propose a nonlinear backstepping-based controller for stabilization and tracking for USSVs and present closed-loop results from HITL simulation and experimental testing.",

        "abstract": "In this paper, a new biomimetic control method for a quadruped walking robot is proposed. The method is derived by the observation of the gravity load receptor and stimulus- reaction mechanism of quadrupeds' locomotion, and the study of the stances on walking and energy efficiency. Though the controller is simple, it provides a useful framework for controlling a quadruped walking robot. In particular, by introducing a new rhythmic pattern generator the heavy computational burden to be paid on solving kinematics is relieved. The effectiveness of the proposed method is validated via a dynamic simulation and experimental works in a quadruped walking robot, called AiDIN(Artiflcial Digitigrade for Natural Environment).",

        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "In this paper, we introduce a passive mobile robot called PRP to realize a transportation of an object in cooperation with a human which is developed based on a concept of passive robotics. The PRP (Passive Robot Porter) consists of three omni-directional wheels with servo brakes and a controller. It can manipulate an object by controlling an external force/moment applied by a human based on the control of the servo brakes. Therefore, if the required external force and moment for realizing the manipulation of the object are become large, the burden of the human would increase and the controllability of the robot would decrease. To overcome these problems, in this paper, we propose a system in which the PRP carries the object through a free joint. By using the free joint, the orientation of the object is changed by the intentional moment applied by the human and the robot only controls the position of the object based on the servo brake control, so that the required intentional force for transporting the object could reduce compared to the previous version of the PRP without using free joint. Additionally, in this paper, we propose a motion control algorithm for the PRP with free joint and illustrate the validity of the proposed system and its control algorithm through the experiments of the object handling.",

A distributed low-level control mechanism is developed based on Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH) and it is coupled with a high-level control layer that is responsible for the control of fluid parameters to generate desired behaviors from the swarming characteristics of the robots. It is shown by simulations that using the same low-level SPH model, different swarming behaviors can emerge from the local interactions of robots according to the settings of the fluid parameters that are controlled by the high-level control layer.",

The planner considers the state of the robot in a global context. The low-level controllers consider only the local environment of the robot and are able to operate at a high frequency to ensure the safety of the robot. Also, it is often the case that the low-level controllers consider more aspects of the robot's state (e.g. kinematic constraints) than the planner. The consideration of such constraints at the planning level would prohibitively increase the state space the planner must consider and, accordingly, its running time and complexity. In this paper, we investigate how we can take advantage at the planning level of domain knowledge encapsulated in the lower level controllers, and we introduce a feedback mechanism that enables low-level controllers to influence the high-level planner.",

The central idea is the development of an abstraction for the team of ground robots that allows the aerial platform to control the team without any knowledge of the specificity of individual vehicles. This happens in much the same way as a human operator can control a single robot vehicle by simply commanding the forward and turning velocities without a detailed knowledge of the specifics of the robot. The abstraction includes a gross model of the shape of the formation of the team and information about the position and orientation of the team in the plane. We derive controllers that allow the team of robots to move in formation while avoiding collisions and respecting the abstraction commanded by the aerial platform. We provide simulation and experimental results using a team of indoor mobile robots and a three-dimensional, cable-controlled, parallel robot which serves as our indoor unmanned aerial platform.",

However, it cannot control the walking behavior because it is dominated by the fixed body dynamics. Observing the human cyclic locomotion emerged by elastic muscles, we add the compliant hip joint on PDW, and we propose a \"phasic dynamics tuner\" that changes the body dynamics by tuning the joint compliance in order to control the walking behavior. The joint compliance is obtained by driving the joint utilizing antagonistic and agonistic McKibben pneumatic actuators. This paper shows that PDW with the compliant joint and the phasic dynamics tuner enhances the walking performance than present PDW with passive free joints. The phasic dynamics tuner can change the walking velocity by tuning the joint compliance. Experimental results show the effectiveness of the joint compliance and the phasic dynamics tuner.",

By combining two strongly heterogeneous robots the diversity of accomplishable tasks increases as the variety of sensors and actuators in the robot systems is extended compared with a team consisting of homogeneous robots. The scenario describes a tightly cooperative task, where the humanoid robot and the wheeled robot follow for a long distance a ball, which is kicked finally by the humanoid robot into a goal. The task can be fulfilled successfully by combining the abilities of both robots. For task distribution and allocation, a newly developed objective function is presented which is based on a proper modeling of the sensing, perception, motion and onboard computing capabilities of the cooperating robots. Aspects of reliability and fault tolerance are considered.",

        "abstract": "In this work we overview two popular algorithms for sensor fusion, linear opinion pool (LOP) and logarithmic opinion pool (LGP) and introduce a new method to overcome their difficulties: cooperative opinion pool (COP). COP considers all of the dependencies between observations such as LOP and reduces the uncertainty such as LGP. We check its performance on a simulated multi-robot environment, where a group of robots cooperate to reduce uncertainty of self- localization and object localization. Simulation results show that the entropy of cooperative localization is reduced as the number of cooperating robots grows.",

In this control algorithm, each mobile manipulator is controlled as if its grasping point has an impedance dynamics by using the real dynamics of the manipulator instead of force/torque sensors. These mobile manipulators handle a single object in coordination using the leader-follower type control algorithm based on the impedance dynamics. Then, the effect of parameter identification errors is discussed and a method to reduce it is proposed. The proposed control algorithm is experimentally applied to two mobile manipulators, and the experimental results illustrate the validity of the proposed control algorithm.",

To use a team of automated vehicles safely and effectively they must be coordinated to avoid collisions and deadlock situations. Unexpected events may occur during the operation which may affect vehicles' velocities, so the coordination method must be robust with respect to these events. In this paper, a path coordination method is introduced which delays decisions about mission coordination as long as possible during mission execution so such unexpected situations are efficiently handled. The method's computation speed and solution quality are evaluated through simulation, and compared with two other methods based on common path coordination techniques.",

        "abstract": "In this paper we address the joint problems of automated data acquisition and view planning for large-scale indoor and outdoor sites. Our method proceeds in two distinct stages. In the initial stage, the system is given a 2-D map with which it plans a minimal set of sufficient covering views. We then use a 3-D laser scanner to take scans at each of these views. When this planning system is combined with our mobile robot, it automatically computes and executes a tour of these viewing locations and acquires the views with the robot's onboard laser scanner. These initial scans serve as an approximate 3-D model of the site. The planning software then enters a second stage in which it updates this model by using a voxel-based occupancy procedure to plan the next best view. This next best view is acquired, and further next best views are sequentially computed and acquired until a complete 3-D model is obtained. Results are shown for Fort Jay on Governors Island in the City of New York and for the church of Saint Menoux in the Bourbonnais region of France.",

In this context, DSLAM is a challenging task. First, data exchange fails due to cut off communication links. Second, loop-closure is cumbersome due to the fact that firefighters will intentionally try to avoid performing loops when facing the reality of emergency response, e.g. while they are searching for victims. In this paper, we introduce a solution to this problem based on the non-selfish sharing of information between pedestrians for loop-closure. We introduce a novel DSLAM method which is based on data exchange and association via RFID technology, not requiring any radio communication. The approach has been evaluated in both semi-indoor and outdoor environments. The presented results show that sharing information between single pedestrians allows to optimize globally their individual paths, even if they are not able to communicate directly.",

        "abstract": "This work proposes a control architecture for the consistent motions of a group of nonholonomic robotic vehicles. We present a decentralized control strategy that permits each vehicle to autonomously compute an optimal trajectory by using only locally generated information. In addition, to reach the desired positions in the robot formation, each robot follows a trajectory that is adapted thanks to reactive terms incorporated in the path planning process. This allows the robot to avoid obstacles and to maintain communication with the rest of the formation. We provide the proof of the convergence of this algorithm. Simulation results validate and highlight the efficiency and relevance of this method.",

The robot delivers verbal messages among the inhabitants of an office-like environment. Essential to the robot's robust performance is our behavior-based robot control architecture enhanced with a state of the art decision theoretic planner that takes into account the temporal characteristics of the robot's actions. The decision theoretic layer is based on the partially observable Markov decision process (POMDP) framework allowing us to achieve principled coordination of complex subtasks implemented as robot behaviors/skills. We compute approximate POMDP policies using the randomized point-based value iteration algorithm and we present heuristics for improving its computational efficiency.",

        "abstract": "Robots are emerging from industrial plants toward every people's daily life. Thus, navigation in and understanding of human related environments becomes a prerequisite for the systems of tomorrow. Most such environments can be efficiently described using line segments. However, incorporation of extent information is often difficult, as line segments are seldom observed completely and erroneous data-association may corrupt the information associated to a certain segment. To reduce such problems this paper proposes a statistically driven description of line segments. The corresponding parameters are decomposed into line and corner features, which are separately tracked through an extended Kalman filter (EKF). Information about the extent of the lines is encoded statistically. Therefore, we use a method to recursively incorporate the information gained through a time-series of measurements. Thus, the covariance matrix belonging to a line segment grows as new regions of the corresponding line are discovered. Experimental results obtained by implementation on the mobile platform ITrike show the validity of our algorithm.",

An organ model including such detailed material characteristics is important to achieve the control method in question. Firstly, the material properties of the liver are modeled from the measured data and its viscoelastic characteristics are represented by differential equations, including the term of the fractional derivative. Nonlinearity in terms of the fractional derivative was measured, and modeled using the quadratic function of strain. Next, a solution of an FE model using such material properties is shown. We use sampling time scaling property as the solution for the viscoelastic system. The solution for a nonlinear system using the Modified Newton-Raphson method is also shown. Finally, the organ deformation, assuming the needle is inserted, is simulated using an organ model and the overall deformation and distribution of the strain is computed in these simulations.",

This technique is currently made possible thanks to the use of mechanical stabilizers. Nevertheless, the available stabilizers are not fully satisfying. Indeed, they have been demonstrated to exhibit significant residual motion. In this paper we propose a novel piezo-actuated compliant stabilizer, whose architecture is compatible with a minimally invasive surgery context. This active stabilizer is controlled using high speed visual feedback in order to compensate in real time for the residual cardiac motion. In vivo experimental results using the developed prototype are given to demonstrate the efficiency of the adopted approach.",

The robot is composed of six actuated universal joints which are serially chained to construct a twelve degrees of freedom snake-like robot optimized for strength and compactness. Any joint in the robot is strong enough to produce a torque that is capable of cantilevering the entire robot. This paper also presents the low-level system- control architecture, which is based on a high-speed RS-485 data bus; this allows the entire system to be operated with only two power and two data wires. The system is controlled from a remote computer on a wireless network and can also run over the Internet.",

Also it has the superior feature in the temperature and frequency stability. On the other hand, the quartz crystal resonator had been hardly applied to a dynamic force measurement because of low degree of mechanical characteristic, that is, it is weak to the impact, bend, and tension. The objective of this study is to construct the sensor mechanism that safely maintains the quartz crystal resonator for the external force with flat structure. We designed and analyzed a novel retention mechanism of the quartz crystal resonator for the flat structure. The proposed force sensor is flat, small, and sensitive enough to be applied to several usages such as medical treatment and dynamic contact force detection of human.",

        "abstract": "This work concerns the development of advanced robotic systems for nuclear application. The manipulator will be used for light intervention in spent fuel management facilities. The robot must meet severe specifications: small diameter, long reach within a minimum range of 6 m, high dexterity to move in constrained environment and lots of degrees of freedom (DOF) for obstacle avoidance. In order to meet these requirements, a very challenging robotic carrier (called P.A.C.) which is able to perform light intervention tasks inside high range of blind hot cells using existing engineering penetrations is developed. This long reach multi-link carrier has 11 DOF and weighs less than 30 kg. The gravity effect in the manipulator is largely compensated by a special mechanical structure (the parallelogram) that helps reducing the size of the rotation actuators used to operate the robot. Also, a glass fiber epoxy equilibrium spring is used to compensate the gravity effect over the elevation actuators. A field test is made to measure the robot's repeatability and accuracy by using a laser tracker to measure the end effector's position. Due to its size and weight, this large robot manipulator holds lots of elastic and geometric deformations. Thus it possesses a very low accuracy. A mechanical model is developed to take into account the flexibilities of the structure. This flexible model will be used to improve the accuracy of the manipulator. Applications tests were made to evaluate the ability and performances of the system to meet the operational requirements. The operation took place in an existing decontaminated hot cell and it turned out to be successful.",

        "abstract": "This paper describes a control for the brachiation robot with holonomic constraint. In our previous work, the brachiation controller is composed of two actions: swing-back and locomotion. The purpose of swing-back is to excite a robot so as to achieve the locomotion successfully, while locomotion action is to move forward by releasing the ladder with the backward arm in the direction of locomotion and gripping the target ladder with another arm. However, the conventional control can not apply brachiation in irregular ladder. And the convetional control was not consider energy efficiency. Thus, a novel method to achieve brachiation in irregular ladder and an energy-efficient brachiation by exacting a swing-back during locomotion is proposed. Experimental results show that the proposed method can improve the locomotion action as much as over 30% in energy consumption.",

PZT is known as one of the promising materials for this purpose with respect to bandwidth, stress, and reliability. However, the most critical drawback of PZT is its extremely small strain, i.e. only 0.1 %. This paper presents a nested rhombus structure for strain amplification of PZT stack actuators. This structure provides a \"power-law\" strain amplification, resulting in over 20 % strain, which is particularly useful for gaining a large strain in a compact body, appropriate for many robotic applications. The notational convention and fundamental force-displacement analysis will be presented. In addition, the feasibility of the design concept will be addressed through the design of a proof- of-concept prototype.",

The device is a drive and steer by wire device using closed loop feedback to provide both fore-aft stability as well as directional control. The controller consists of two parts, a closed loop pitch controller that maintains balance and governs the morion of the device forward and backward and a yaw or steering controller that governs the turn rate via differential wheel speed. The transporter is unique in that it is much smaller than the operator and it couples to motions of the entire body, rather than an arm or leg independently. An impedance model was adopted to account for the human in the loop, there by making the design problem tractable and relatively straightforward to implement.",

Meeting these constraints requires implementing a complex mechanical and electrical architecture. Here we present our solution, which involves the construction of sixteen aluminum modules and creation of the Super Servo, a modified hobby servo. To create the Super Servo, we have replaced the electronics in a hobby servo, adding such components as sensors to monitor current and temperature, a communications bus, and a programmable microcontroller. Any robust solution must also protect components from hazardous environments such as sand and brush. To resolve this problem we insert the robots into skins that cover their surface. Functions such as climbing the inside and outside of a pipe add a new dimension of interaction. Thus we attach a compliant, high-friction material to every module, which assists in tasks that require gripping. This combination of the mechanical and electrical architectures results in a robust and versatile robot.",

The most important operational requirement of this device is that the device should support large weight of the PDP panel and be foldable to save the space between the PDP panel and the wall. An asymmetric parallel structure that has three kinematic chains with internal four-bar is proposed to meet such requirements. The special four-bar mechanism is foldable and supports large weight structurally, which allows employment of small-sized actuators for motion. The kinematic modeling and kinematic analysis was performed along with actuator sizing. Finally, this mechanism was developed and tested to show the effectiveness as the PDP TV mounting device. It is believed that this device is a successful commercialized parallel mechanism.",

For this purpose, we develop an operation model in which each robot enters a maintenance mode while operating on the basis of its reliability. We also aim to design the mean time between failure (MTBF) which is a kind of a measure of robot performance on the basis of the robots\u2019 reliability as well as the number of robots. However, this is a combinatorial design problem. Therefore, we propose a design methodology in order to derive one combinatorial design solution for a given demand by considering a system management cost that includes a system construction cost and a penalty cost. The designed systems are evaluated on the basis of the system management costs. Finally, we present the validity of the proposed design methodology and designed systems.",

        "abstract": "Natural orifice transluminal endoscopic surgery, or NOTES, allows for exceedingly minimally invasive surgery but has high requirements for the dexterity and force capabilities of the tools. An overview of the ViaCath System is presented. This system is a first generation teleoperated robot for endoluminal surgery and consists of a master console with haptic interfaces, slave drive mechanisms, and 6 degree-of-freedom, long-shafted flexible instruments that run alongside a standard gastroscope or colonoscope. The system was validated through animal studies. It was discovered that the devices were difficult to introduce into the GI tract and manipulation forces were insufficient. The design of a second generation system is outlined with improvements to the instrument articulation section and a steerable overtube. Results of basic evaluation tests performed on the tools are also presented.",

We incorporate coil shape SMA as variable length tendons of tendon-driven robots. By controlling electrical resistance of SMA tendons, we can control posture of the robot structure in model-based method. A method to resolve electrical resistance for control from given posture of a high degree of freedom robot by using model of SMA and the robot is proposed. A small electrical system for high D.O.F. robots is also developed. As an application of our system, we show a four-legged robot with 16 D.O.F. joints and 24 SMA tendons.",

Next, a new, simplified method of modeling kinematics is introduced. A novel verification procedure is then applied to examine the validity of the proposed model in two different domains of applicability and could be used to verify many other models that are constructed based on similar assumptions. Finally, a two-level electrical control scheme enables rapid prototyping.",

        "abstract": "Recent events have proven the utility of aerial robots in search and rescue and military operations performed in near-Earth environments. However, autonomy in such environments is still limited by the robot's ability to perform collision avoidance. Real time, high fidelity maps can be utilized to assist the robot in performing collision avoidance. This paper explores the use of a laser range finder to accomplish real time map building in the presence of obscurants. Experiments were conducted to determine the probabilistic models of the sensor in the presence of rain and fog. These models are then utilized to map obstacles and terrain features in the presence of obscurants. Preliminary results show the implementation of these methods in an aerial vehicle testing facility.",

A walking model is built to describe the periodicity of the movement of the feet in the spatial-temporal domain, and a mean-shift clustering technique in combination with spatial- temporal correlation analysis is applied to detect pedestrians. Based on the walking model, particle filter is employed to track multiple pedestrians. Compared with camera-based methods, our system provides a novel technique to track multiple pedestrians in a relatively large area. The experiments, in which over 300 pedestrians were tracked in 5 minutes, show the validity of the proposed system.",

        "abstract": "Recently, Intra-Operative Magnetic Resonance Imaging (IO-MRI) has attracted attention for the reason of operating quality. In the other hand, surgical assist robot with high accuracy is widely researched. By combining IO-MRI and surgical assist robot to an MR-compatible surgical assist robot, higher quality of operation is expected. In this paper, we introduce a novel actuator for MR-compatible Surgical Assist Robot, which actively uses MR magnetic field and is drive by regulating pulse current. Use of ratchet mechanism enables step wise motion of the rotor similar to stepping motors. The position of the rotor can be controlled without an encoder. Clock-wise rotation, counter clock-wise rotation, constrained and non-constrained conditions were achieved by using this mechanism. Evaluation of the first prototype (84\u00d776\u00d758(mm3), 380 (gram)) shows that it is MR-compatible and has a very high positioning accuracy (step angle CW: 12.04\u00b10.28 (deg), CCW : 12.22\u00b10.36(deg); backlash < 1(deg)). No-load maximum rotational speed is 35.71(rpm) and maximum torque 15.1\u00d7 10\u22123 (N\u00b7m).",

        "abstract": "The shortage of nurses in large hospitals of developed countries has become a major problem. Especially, the shortage of scrub nurses, who assist operating surgeons exchange surgical instruments, has been chronically severe. To compensate for this shortage, we have been proposing the scrub nurse robot (SNR) system that is capable of functioning as a skilled human scrub nurse in endoscopic and laparoscopic surgery. We developed the 2nd version of SNR, and achieved smooth and wide movement of its arms each with 4 DOF. The 2nd SNR is able to speak several sentences and recognize some words as well as the names of surgical instruments, and is also capable of recognizing a surgeon's intraoperative actions by its real-time visual recognition system (RTVRS). The RTVRS is basically composed of both a commercially-available 3D position tracking system and the algorithm that we developed to recognize surgeons' actions during exchange of instruments from the above-mentioned positional data. In this paper, we evaluated how quickly and timely the RTVRS-driven SNR helped surgeon's stand-ins exchange instruments in a laboratory, in comparison with human scrub nurses in real surgical operations. We found two problems about the current RTVRS-driven SNR: one is its response time and the other is chiefly related to the design and mechanism of the part storing the surgical instruments. 1) Concerning the first problem, the RTVRS-driven SNR took 2.11 sec until it finished holding out its hand with an instrument after it had detected a surgeon's stand-in's motions observed during extraction of a surgical instrument. However, a skilled real surgeon took 1.90 sec until he got the requested instrument in the clinical cases although he had to wait for as long as 1.24 sec until receiving it. Therefore, we must speed up the SNR's performance at least by 0.2 sec to assist the real surgeon as human scrub nurses did. Especially, since 0.68 sec out of the 2.11 sec was spent in data processing withi... Show More",

The wearable motion capture is defined that it not only measures the posture of the human body but also collects environmental information and the human\u2019s internal state simultaneously and easily. Because the realized device automatically configures wireless networks and is small enough to attach it anywhere, it is easy to gather any sensor information. The feature of the orientation estimation method is that models are switched according to the environment to exclude the effect of motion disturbances. In experiments, by integrating of sole sensors and the orientation sensors, walking around, walking up and down, and jumping tasks were successfully measured. Because it is difficult to measure these motions with only the inertial sensors, it showed the importance of integrating various sensors for acquiring human motion.",

The robot arms are equipped with force sensors to detect physical contact with objects. We proposed a motion algorithm consisting of searching tasks, self-localization, correction of locomotion direction and obstacle avoidance. Priority is given to right-side direction to navigate the robot locomotion in conjunction with a strategy to avoid obstacles. The proposed algorithm is evaluated in an experiment with a humanoid robot operating in a room with walls and obstacles. The experimental results reveal good performance of the robot when recognizing objects by touching and grasping, continuously generating suitable trajectory to correct locomotion direction and avoiding collisions.",

        "abstract": "This paper presents the development of a finger-mounted tactile sensor for surface irregularity detection. The sensor is composed of a thin rubber sheet and a silicone rubber with the void in the center. On the center of the rubber sheet, two strain gauges are attached point-symmetrically. The user puts his/her finger on the silicone rubber of the sensor and slides the sensor over the objective surface. For mounting the sensor on the finger, the sensor is embedded in a cotton work glove. By obtaining difference between the two strain gauges, the sensor responds to the surface irregularity. It does not respond to the uniform surface. Furthermore, real-time signal processing utilizing the wavelet transform is proposed for detecting surface irregularity from sensor output signals. Experiments are carried out on the plane surface and curved surface with a small protrusion. Moreover, the sensor is improved on the basis of the experimental results. Silicone oil sheet is attached on the bottom of the sensor as a viscous fluid medium for improving unstable contact between the sensor and the objective surface. Using the improved sensor, experiments are carried out. The results show that the proposed sensor is capable of detecting the surface irregularity.",

        "abstract": "Studies of individual cells via microscopy and microinjection are a key component in research on gene functions, cancer, stem cells, and reproductive technology. As biomedical experiments become more complex, there is an urgent need for robotic systems to: improve cell manipulation, increase throughput, reduce lost cells, and improve reaction detection. Automation of these tasks using visual servoing creates significant benefits for biomedical laboratories including repeatability of experiments, higher throughput, and a controlled environment capable of operating 24 hours a day. In this work the design and development of a new five degree-of- freedom biomanipulator designed for single-cell microinjection, is described. The biomanipulator employs three degrees of linear motion and two degrees of rotation. This provides the ability to manipulate/micro-inject cells at varying orientations, thereby increasing flexibility in dealing with complex operations such as injecting clustered cells. The capability of the biomanipulator is shown with preliminary experimental results using mouse myeloma cells.",

        "abstract": "This article provides in-depth knowledge about our undergoing effort to develop an open architecture micromanipulation system with force sensing capabilities. The major requirement to perform any micromanipulation task effectively is to ensure the controlled motion of actuators within nanometer accuracy with low overshoot even under the influence of disturbances. Moreover, to achieve high dexterity in manipulation, control of the interaction forces is required. In micromanipulation, control of interaction forces necessitates force sensing in milli-Newton range with nano-Newton resolution . In this paper, we present a position controller based on a discrete time sliding mode control architecture along with a disturbance observer. Experimental verifications for this controller are demonstrated for 100, 50 and 10 nanometer step inputs applied to PZT stages. Our results indicate that position tracking accuracies up to 10 nanometers, without any overshoot and low steady state error are achievable. Furthermore, the paper includes experimental verification of force sensing within nano-Newton resolution using a piezoresistive cantilever end- effector. Experimental results are compared to the theoretical estimates of the change in attractive forces as a function of decreasing distance and of the pull off force between a silicon tip and a glass surface, respectively. Good agreement among the experimental data and the theoretical estimates has been demonstrated.",

(3) Receiving users' command as a simple user-interface. (4) Communicating to a host computer and informs the contents of the container and users' command. To realize those roles, the container is equipped with a grasping navigation mechanism for robot handling, RFID reader for the recognition of contents, and LCD device to display supporting information to human and robot. Finally, a primary function is evaluated in experiment to confirm that an acceleration sensor enables the container to detect being transferred by human. In the future, the intelligent container will play a role of contact point for human and robots in our target system, that enables human-robot symbiotic life.",

        "abstract": "Experiments on animals has been playing very important part in psychology, medical science, genetics and brain science. Rodents are one of the most popular experimental subjects in these experiments. In psychology and brain science, behavior test and analysis on rodents, especially rats, has been performed to clarify mechanisms of mind or brain functions. \"Open-field test\" is one of the most popular research methods to investigate their behavior. In the \"open-field test,\" rats are released into the \"open-field,\" circle or square, flat arena surrounded by walls, and their behavior parameters such as position, moving distance, number of grooming and rearing are measured. With conventional experimental setups, these parameters has been measured and recorded by humans. Observing and recording are heavy task for experimenters, and also involves some human errors and subjectivity. Therefore, we developed an autonomous experimental setup which measures rats' position, number of grooming and rearing in the open-field. In addition, an active tracking camera which takes high resolution images of the rat in the open-field was developed. To prevent losing tracks of the rat, a prediction model of rat's movement is developed and integrated into the control of this camera.",

The wheel is used in a omnidirectional mobile robot realizing high step-climbing capability with its hemispherical wheel. Conventional Omniwheels can realize omnidirectional motion, however they have a poor step overcoming ability due to the sub-wheel small size. The proposed desing solves this drawback by means of a 4 wheeled design. \u201cOmni-Ball\u201d is formed by two passive rotational hemispherical wheels and one active rotational axis. An actual prototype model has been developed to illustrate the concept and to perform preliminary motion experiments, through which the basic performance of the Omnidirectional vechicle with this proposed Omni-Ball mechanism was confirmed. An prototype has been developed to illustrate the concept. Motion experiments, with a test vehicle are also presented.",

Applying the muscle suit to non-healthy people such as elderly people and/or disable one requires very high-level safety and usability, from the practical point of view.

One of the important matter to realize mobile robots for extreme environments are to establish systems in tbe movement and their structures which are strong enough to disturbance and breakdowns. A solution to develop robust robot systems are to learn and imitate biological systems. For example, in the spinal cord of animals, neural oscillator systems called Central Pattern Generator (CPG) are proven to exist and investigated that CPG control rhythmical signals such as swimming pattern, walking locomotion, heart beats, etc. In this paper, neural oscillator based motion control system was developed using micro-computer PIC, and applied to motion control of snake-like robot. The robot can move forwards, backwards by changing weights and change direction by adjusting command parameters from the upper layer.",

Extra degrees of freedom (DOF) of a redundant robot are effective for realizing an objective position and orientation of its end effector (referred to hereafter as \"pose\"), while the robot is avoiding obstacles. The path should be planned so as that the robot can avoid obstacles and realize the desired goal pose. The models of six elementary types of obstacles are assumed, taking account of real environment. The path planning method proposed herein is divided into three procedures as follows: 1) solving inverse kinematics by an analytical method for avoiding six elementary types of obstacles, 2) solving inverse kinematics by a semi-analytical method for realizing a goal pose, and 3) generating a path from a start pose to the goal one. A computational simulator for a redundant robot to avoid arbitrary obstacles based on these procedures is developed.",

        "abstract": "Airway management is provided by emergency medical technicians or anesthetists in order to save unconscious patients who are unable to breathe. Even though it is a basic technique, many accidents may occur when the procedure is not provided followed. In order to avoid any risks to patients, emergency medical technicians are required to practice airway management using training devices such as mannequins; which are designed to accurately reproduce the human anatomy. However, such training devices do not provide any quantitative information about the learning progress of trainees (passive training). For that purpose, we have proposed the development of a airway management training system which is designed to embed array of sensors so that quantitative information of trainees' performance can be acquired. In this paper, we are presenting the Waseda-KyotoKagaku airway No. 1 (WKA-1). The WKA-1 consists of three different kinds of array of sensors which are embedded into a conventional mannequin. In order to embed the array of sensors, we have simplified the design of some of the simulated organs (upper airway, oral cavity, tongue and teeth) of the mannequin. A set of evaluation parameters were proposed based on the information collected through the sensors. A set of experiments were proposed to experimentally verify the effectiveness of the proposed evaluation parameters to quantitatively detect differences among different levels of skills (anesthetists and unskilled persons).",

        "abstract": "Authors have proposed as a long-term goal, since 2004, the development of a patient robot which could serve for both training purposes as well as an evaluation tool of medical procedures. As a first approach, we have developed last year a suture and ligature training system named Waseda Kyotokagaku Suture No. 1 (WKS-1), which is composed by a commercial skin dummy with arrays of embedded sensors designed to acquire quantitative data of the task. The WKS-1 was designed to reproduce realistically the task conditions as well as providing objective assessment of the task performance. In particular, the proposed evaluation function considered the following performance indexes: time, displacement and force levels. By performing experiments with medical doctors and unskilled persons, we confirmed the effectiveness of WKS-1 to provide objective assessments of the task performance. However, the functionalities of WKS-1 were too restricted as few automatic procedures were implemented for the acquisition and processing of the collected data. Therefore; in this paper, we are presenting the Waseda Kyotokagaku Suture No. 2 (WKS-2). The WKS-2 has been designed to provide more detailed information of the task performance as well as improving its portability, connectivity, and usability. In addition, thanks to the design improvements on the WKS-2, we have proposed additional evaluation parameters to measure the quality of the suture (after the task has been completed). For this purpose, we proposed a image processing algorithm to automatically measure the width of sutures, the distance among them and the wound area. Preliminary experiments were carried out to verify its effectiveness.",

This method computes both object and finger trajectories as well as the finger relocation sequence. Its specificity is to use a special structuring of the research space that allows to search for paths directly in the particular subspace GSn which is the subspace of all the grasps that can be achieved with n grasping fingers. The solving of the dexterous manipulation planning problem is based upon the exploration of this subspace. The proposed approach captures the connectivity of GSn in a graph structure. The answer of the manipulation planning query is then given by searching a path in the computed graph. Simulation experiments were conducted for different dexterous manipulation task examples to validate the proposed method.",

        "abstract": "This paper describes a series of gaits which we developed for a free crawling snake robot. Snake robots, a class of hyper-redundant mechanisms, can use their many degrees of freedom to achieve a variety of locomotion capabilities. Like their biological counterparts, snake robots locomote using cyclic motions called gaits. These cyclic motions directly control the snake robot's internal degrees of freedom which causes a net motion (e.g. sining moves the robot forward, strafing moves the robot laterally, and spinning rotates the robot about its center). The gaits described in this paper fall into two categories: differentiable and piecewise differentiable. The differentiable gaits, as their name suggests, can be described by a differentiable function whereas the piecewise cannot. This paper describes the functions we prescribed for gait generation and our experiences in making these robots operate in real experiments.",

It is based on the stochastic search of solutions in the state space to the global localization problem by means of a differential evolution algorithm. A non linear evolutive filter, called Evolutive Localization Filter (ELF), searches stochastically along the state space for the best robot pose estimate. The proposed SLAM algorithm operates in two steps: in the first step the ELF filter is used at a local level to re-localize the robot based on the robot odometry, the laser scan at a given position and a local map where only a low number of the last scans have been integrated. In a second step the aligned laser measures together with the corrected robot poses are use to detect when the robot is revisiting a previously crossed area. Once a cycle is detected, the Evolutive Localization Filter is used again to re-estimate the robot poses in order to integrate the sensor measures in the global map of the environment. The algorithm has been tested in different environments to demonstrate the effectiveness, robustness and computational efficiency of the proposed approach.",

We extend this concept to robotic hands and show how a similar dimensionality reduction can be defined for a number of different hand models. This framework can be used to derive planning algorithms that produce stable grasps even for highly complex hand designs. Furthermore, it offers a unified approach for controlling different hands, even if the kinematic structures of the models are significantly different. We illustrate these concepts by building a comprehensive grasp planner that can be used on a large variety of robotic hands under various constraints.",

        "abstract": "Existing visual servoing techniques which do not need metric information require, on the other hand, prior knowledge about the object's shape and/or the camera's motion. In this paper, we propose a new visual servoing technique which does not require any of them. The method is direct in the sense that: the intensity value of all pixels is used (i.e. we avoid the feature extraction step which introduces errors); and that the proposed control error as well as the control law are fully based on image data (i.e. metric measures are neither required nor estimated). Besides not relying on prior information, the scheme is robust to large errors in the camera's internal parameters. We provide the theoretical proofs that the proposed task function is locally isomorphic to the camera pose, that the approach is motion- and shape-independent, and also that the derived control law ensures local asymptotic stability. Furthermore, the proposed control error allows for simple, smooth, physically valid, singularity-free path planning, which leads to a large domain of convergence for the servoing. The approach is validated through various results using objects of different shapes, large initial displacements as well as large errors in the camera's internal parameters.",

For modeling the developmental process of discovering ability, the following three approaches are employed. (i) Projection of a selfmodel for predicting other individual\u2019s actions. (ii) Mediation by a physical object between self and other individual. (iii) Introduction of infant imitation by parent. For creating the self-model of a robot, we apply Recurrent Neural Network with Parametric Bias (RNNPB) model which can learn the robot\u2019s body dynamics. For the other-model of a human, conventional hierarchical neural networks are attached to the RNNPB model as \u201cconversion modules\u201d. Our target task is a moving an object. For evaluation of our model, human discovery experiments by the robot projecting its self-model were conducted. The results demonstrated that our method enabled the robot to predict the human\u2019s motions, and to estimate the human\u2019s position fairly accurately, which proved its adequacy.",

We begin by offering a brief system overview and then describe methods to determine the range of operation of the robot. Next, a discrete-time model of the system is presented. Thereafter, we present an online algorithm for modeling motor behavior. The majority of the paper is dedicated to describing three feedback control laws used to enable accurate trajectory tracking for both linear and non-linear motion profiles. We present experimental results that highlight the strengths and weaknesses of these mechanisms and conclude by offering a series of future plans for NIMS3D.",

        "abstract": "The present work considers modular robotic structures equipped with an embedded control architecture and proposes a distributed kinematic inversion technique enabling the execution of manipulation operations. The presented strategy is not based on role assignments; all the modules are identical from the control point of view and can be therefore added, removed or exchanged on wish, with no impact on the overall control architecture. In addition every module has just to a-priori know a very limited set of local information while can be totally unaware about the characteristics of the remaining part of the chain. All the information needed for coordination are indeed on-line obtained through communication with other modules. No external centralized controller knowing the overall robot geometry and kinematics is necessary. More simply a global self-coordinating behaviour is autonomously established and propagated along the chain through data-exchanges.",

        "abstract": "When a small object in a hand-held device moves periodically and prismatically with asymmetric acceleration (strong in one direction and weak in the other), the holder typically experiences the kinesthetic illusion of being pushed or pulled continuously by the held device. We investigated this perceptual effect for its potential application to a hand-held, non-grounded, haptic device that can convey a sense of a continuous translational force in one direction, which is a yet missing tile in haptics research. A one-degree of freedom haptic device based on two symmetric slider-crank mechanism was constructed to convert the single-speed rotational cyclic movement of a motor into asymmetric translational cyclic movement with asymmetric acceleration and to cancel unwanted side acceleration. We verified our previous results with the haptic device and investigated the effect of the gross weight of the device on force perception.",

        "abstract": "This paper deals with a novel approach based on the synergy between the dynamic motions of balancing masses and arms to reject large perturbations applied to the upper part of a bipedal robot. Initially the stabilization is carried out with a trunk having 4 degrees of freedom: three translations and one rotation. In the second time the stabilization is performed with a system with arms and having 10 DOFs. At first, for a vertical posture of the robot, the trunk bodies of ROBIAN are used to compensate the external three-dimensional efforts applied to the robot. During the simulation, this study allows us to determine on-line, the required movements and accelerations of the trunk bodies in order to maintain the robot stability. In the following stage, we study the required movements of a system which is made up of a trunk and two arms in order to ensure the robot stability in presence of disturbances or during a handling of an object. The same formalism is chosen to study the dynamics of the new upper part of the robot. This study shows the importance of the arms for the robot stability.",

First, the robot dynamics are parameterized in a new form to exclude the stiffness torque, and are solved with a rich set of data. The stiffness torque is then reconstructed from the new parameter set, and a torsional spring model is fit to the measured data. This method offers a better conditioned system of equations for weakly-flexible systems, and more flexibility in the choice of torsional spring model. The two-step identification method is experimentally evaluated on a Mitsubishi PA10-6CE.",

This algorithm integrates a dynamic multidimensional scaling (MDS) method and the dead reckoning method enabled by a wearable position tracking (WePoST) system through sensor fusion technique. The essential idea of the dynamic MDS (DMDS) is to reduce the localization error by increasing the network density and connectivity through the addition of virtual nodes. Sensor fusion technique is used to improve the consistency of the dynamic MDS algorithm by integrating the knowledge of short distance displacement. Tests done in simulation verify the proposed dynamic localization algorithm.",

        "abstract": "Carbon nanotubes (CNTs) are good candidates for many electronics and sensing applications. These applications will require moving (deposit) and orienting carbon nanotubes to specific location, and separating CNTs with semiconducting and metallic band structure. In this paper, a new mathematical model describing precisely the rotational motion of carbon nanotubes in viscous medium (acetone) is presented. This new mathematical model correctly assumes that carbon nanotubes form a line shape after undergoing AC electric field compare to existing model that assumes carbon nanotubes to be a spherical particle. The new mathematical model is based on a newly developed model for applied torque due to electrorotation. It is also a method for controlled assembly of the CNTs on microstructures that have the plausibility to be scaled to waferlevel manufacturing. Simulation results are presented for the developed models. The developed model can be used to detect the position of carbon nanotubes and further implemented in the separation of semiconducting and metallic band structure carbon nanotubes.",

        "abstract": "Dynamic Parameter Identification is a useful tool for developing and evaluating robot control strategies. However, a multi degree of freedom robot arm has many parameters, and the process of determining them is challenging. Much research has been done in this area and experimental methods have been applied on several robot arms. To our knowledge, there is currently no set of inertial parameters, either by modelling or by estimation, available for the CRS A460/A465 arm, a popular laboratory table top robot. In this paper we review and compare a number of methods for dynamic parameter identification and for generating trajectories suitable for estimating the identifiable dynamic parameters of a given robot. We then present a step by step process for dynamic parameter identification of a serial manipulator, and demonstrate this process by experimentally identifying the dynamic parameters of the CRS A460 robot.",

        "abstract": "There is a tendency today toward the study of distributed systems consisting of many heterogeneous, networked, cooperating robotic devices. We refer to a system of this type as an ecology of robots. We call functional configuration of this ecology a way to allocate and connect functionalities among its robots. In general, the same ecology can perform different tasks by using different configuration. Moreover, the same task can often be solved using different configurations, and which is the best one depends on the available resources. This potential flexibility of a robot ecology is reduced by the fact that, in most current approaches, configurations are pre-programmed by hand. In this paper, we propose a plan-based approach to automatically generate a preferred configuration of a robot ecology given a task, environment, and set of resources. In contrast to previous approaches, the state of the ecology is automatically acquired at planning time, and it is monitored during execution in order to reconfigure if a functionality fails. We illustrate these ideas on a specific instance of an ecology of robots, called PEIS Ecology. We also show an experiment run on our PEIS Ecology testbed, in which a robot needs to reconfigure when the original configuration fails.",

The model takes as input the steering angle of the wheels in front and the rotational velocities of the drive wheels in the back of the vehicle. It delivers a 3-DOF output in terms of CoG vehicle velocity, body slip angle and the yaw rate of the vehicle in the x-y plane, as well as estimates on the forces acting on the system. It is suitable for modeling dynamic vehicle regimes in e.g. overtaking maneuvers/obstacle avoidance and lane-keeping, enabling active steering control by stabilizing the dynamics of the vehicle. The physical model description is based on previous works combined with a suitable friction model that is tractable in practice. Experimental verification of the obtained model is given for the Smart testing vehicle platform, where a separate analysis is done for directly measured as opposed to estimated/optimized parameters of the model.",

        "abstract": "Field Robots are machines that work in unstructured environments. Handling the mobility performance requirements of a challenging rough terrain makes a suspended wheeled mobile robot (SWMR), with multiple dexterous manipulators, an appropriate field robot design. In this study, first a general systematic procedure for dynamics modeling of such complicated systems is presented based on application of Newton-Euler's formulation for a chain of rigid bodies. Then, to verify the obtained dynamics model, another model for the considered system has been developed using ADAMS simulation software. Comparison between the results obtained from these two models confirms the thoroughness of the proposed analytical model. The presented approach can provide the interaction wrench(es) between the mobile base and the mounted arm(s). Next, using the obtained dynamics, the tip-over stability of such systems will be investigated. To this end, the new dynamic tip-over Moment- Height Stability (MHS) measure will be extended for suspended wheeled mobile robotic systems. Proposing the concept of virtual structure, the obtained planar model of SWMR has been employed to evaluate the behavior of the system on rough terrain in terms of its stability. Therefore the presented model and the MHS measure can be employed for stable planning and model-based control of autonomous SWMR during object manipulation tasks.",

Surmounting steps is normally not considered when determining peak torque needs, yet it can be the maximum requirement. This work looks at the statics and dynamics of this situation to determine the necessary peak torque. It finds that using a dynamic model that includes the wheel elasticity is essential for properly representing a real-world tire. When torque is increased using a step function, energy is stored in the tire - higher tire elasticity eases climbing. Knowledge of this phenomenon could facilitate the use of smaller actuators. The model is numerically integrated and results are found to agree with experiment.",

        "abstract": "Piezoelectric bending actuators are an attractive option for driving microrobots due to their light weight, scalability, ease of integration and high bandwidth. However, the only existing energy or power output measurements for piezoelectric bending actuators have been extrapolated from DC values or unloaded AC values and are most likely overestimates. For microrobot applications such as flapping flight, accurate measures of power density are critical. In this work, to properly measure the energy output of a lOmg piezoelectric actuator, a custom dynamometer is designed and constructed to directly measure the power output at various frequencies and conditions. The dynamometer can simulate a pure resistive load at resonant frequencies from 1 to 100Hz. Due to low internal damping and fracture limits, actuators cannot be run in the matched condition at high fields (> 1 V/mum). Using the device, energy output per cycle at 1.6 V/mum was measured to be a maximum of 19.1 muJ/cycle (232 mum amplitude, 30Hz), giving a delivered energy density per cycle of 1.89J/kg. Internal actuator damping was measured at 1 V/mum to account for an energy loss of only 0.21muJ per cycle (232 mum amplitude, 30Hz).",

        "track": "main",
        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "In robot teleoperation scenarios, the interface between the user and the robot is undoubtedly of high importance. In this paper, electromyographic (EMG) signals from muscles of the human upper limb are used as the control interface between the user and a remote robot arm. The proposed interface consists of surface EMG electrodes, placed at the user's skin at several locations on the arm, letting the user's upper limb free of bulky interface sensors or machinery usually found in conventional teleoperation systems. The motion of the human upper limb entails the activation of a large number of muscles (i.e. more than 30 muscles, not including finger movements). Moreover, the human arm has 7 degrees of freedom (DoFs) suggesting a wide variety of motions. Therefore, the mapping between these two high-dimensional data (i.e. the muscles activation and the motion of the human arm), is an extremely challenging issue. For this reason, a novel methodology is proposed here, where the mapping between the muscles activation and the motion of the user's arm is done in a low-dimensional space. Each of the high-dimensional input (muscle activation) and output (arm motion) vectors, is transformed into an individual low-dimensional space, where the mapping between the two low-dimensional vectors is then feasible. A state-space model is trained to map the low-dimensional representation of the muscles activation to the corresponding motion of the user's arm. After training, the state-space model can decode the human arm motion in real time with high accuracy, using only EMG recordings. The estimated motion is used to control a remote anthropomorphic robot arm. The accuracy of the proposed method is assessed through real-time experiments including motion in two-dimensional (2D) space.",

Shared control is typically achieved either by giving control to the human or the robot at some specific situations. In this work, we propose a method to share control between humans and robots at each point of a given trajectory, so that both have weight in the resulting behavior of the mobile. This is achieved by estimating their respective local efficiencies at each time instant and combining their commands into a single order. In order to achieve a seamless combination, this procedure is integrated into a bottom-up architecture via a reactive layer. The system is meant to be used in wheelchair control for people with disabilities. Thus far, we have tested the proposed method using a Pioneer AT robot driven by several volunteers. Results have been satisfactory both from a quantitative and qualitative point of view.",

        "abstract": "Learning maps is one of the fundamental tasks of mobile robots. In the past, numerous efficient approaches to map learning have been proposed. Most of them, however, assume that the robot lives on a plane. In this paper, we consider the problem of learning maps with mobile robots that operate in non-flat environments and apply maximum likelihood techniques to solve the graph-based SLAM problem. Due to the non-commutativity of the rotational angles in 3D, major problems arise when applying approaches designed for the two-dimensional world. The non-commutativity introduces serious difficulties when distributing a rotational error over a sequence of poses. In this paper, we present an efficient solution to the SLAM problem that is able to distribute a rotational error over a sequence of nodes. Our approach applies a variant of gradient descent to solve the error minimization problem. We implemented our technique and tested it on large simulated and real world datasets. We furthermore compared our approach to solving the problem by LU-decomposition. As the experiments illustrate, our technique converges significantly faster to an accurate map with low error and is able to correct maps with bigger noise than existing methods.",

        "abstract": "Motion planning for humanoid robotic systems with many degrees of freedom is an important and still generally unsolved problem. To give the robot the ability of acting and navigating in complex environments, the motion planner has to find collision-free paths in a robust manner. The runtime of a planning algorithm is critical, since complex tasks require several planning steps where the collision detection and avoidance should be accomplished in reasonable time. In this paper we present an extension of standard sampling-based techniques using Rapidly Exploring Random Trees (RRT). We extend the free-bubble path validation algorithm from Quinlan, which can be used to guarantee the collision-free status of a C-space path between two samples. By using enlarged robot models it is possible to avoid costly distance calculations and therefore to speed up the planning process. We also present a combined approach based on lazy collision checking that brings together the advantages of fast sampling-based and exact path-validated algorithms. The proposed algorithms have been evaluated by experiments on a humanoid robot in a kitchen environment and by a comparison to a validation based on Quinlan's free bubbles approach.",

It uses the popular PRM method for navigating a robot through an environment. One of the key features of PRM is that it moves the major part of the calculations involved in the path planning process to the preprocessing phase. After that, paths can be extracted very quickly (in a query phase) usually without any noticeable delay. While very successful in many applications, doing most of the work in a preprocessing phase restricts the environment to be static i.e. obstacles are not allowed to change their configurations after the preprocessing phase. In this paper we describe and evaluate an algorithm based on PRM that does allow obstacles to change their configuration after preprocessing while still allowing for a quick query phase.",

        "abstract": "A simple and robust inter-module latch is possibly the most important component of a modular robotic system. This paper describes a latch based on electric fields and capacitive coupling. Our design provides not only significant adhesion forces, but can also be used for inter-module power transmission and communication. The key insight presented in this paper, and the factor that enables electrostatic adhesion to be effective at the macroscale, is the use of electric field attraction to generate frictional shear forces rather than electric field attraction alone. A second important insight is that a specific degree of flexibility in the electrodes is essential to maximize their mutual coupling and the resulting forces - electrodes which are too flexible or too rigid will perform less well. To evaluate the effectiveness of our latch we incorporate it into a cubic module 28 cm on a side. The result is a latch which requires almost zero static power and yet can hold 0.6 N/cm2 of latch area.",

        "abstract": "Reinforcement learning addresses the question of programming an autonomous agent to execute tasks that are described as reinforcement functions. Then, the agent is responsible for discovering the best actions to fulfil such task. Most of the work on reinforcement learning considers that reinforcements are given by the environment, not addressing the problem of how to describe tasks as reinforcement functions. Preference elicitation addresses the problem of describing a human preference through utility functions, from which reinforcement functions are special cases. This paper proposes an approach where preference elicitation and reinforcement learning are handled in an integrated manner, providing an autonomous method of programming an agent. The agent is programmed through pairwise evaluations over observed behaviours of the agent, where the evaluations are summarised in the reinforcement function. In this paper we present an approach to solve such a problem based on evaluations over observed behaviours. We propose a new algorithm, PEOB-RS, that can be shown to converge towards an optimal policy, providing the number of trials for each behaviour tends to infinity. Experimental results from learning in a grid stochastic environment are used to obtain a reinforcement function, illustrating the effectiveness of PEOB-RS, even if requiring too many evaluations. Such reinforcement function is then transferred to a more real-like environment simulating a pioneer robot, showing the abstraction property of utility functions.",

        "abstract": "Autonomous robots are presently unable to match the adaptive capabilities of even the simplest of animals. Affective processes such as emotions are highly effective facilitators of adaptive behavior in humans and animals. Thus, it can be argued that emotions can bestow robots with similar adaptive advantages. In particular, artificial emotions can improve a robot's performance by modulating actions, prioritizing goals and providing reinforcements for learning. A hierarchical robot architecture that incorporates reactive and deliberative emotions has been developed to test this hypothesis. Reactive emotions arise from predictions of emotion-eliciting events from short-term sensor data and internal representations. Deliberative emotions are modeled as learned associations between environmental states and previous emotion-eliciting events. Emotions interact with multiple architectural levels by modulating parameters controlling the robot's degree of bias towards various competing drives, such as goal-seeking, safety and exploration. The model has been implemented on a simulated mobile robot for a navigation task.",

The concept of the mirror neurons/systems[1] is very interesting and suggests that behavior acquisition and the inferring intention of other are related to each other. That is, the behavior learning modules might be used not only for behavior acquisition/execution but also for the understanding of the behavior/intention of other. We propose a novel method not only to learn and execute a variety of behaviors but also to understand behavior of others supposing that the observer has already acquired the utilities (state values in reinforcement learning scheme) of all kinds of behaviors the observed agent can do. The method does not need a precise world model or coordination transformation system to deal with view difference caused by different viewpoints. This paper shows that an observer can understand/recognize a behavior of other not by precise object trajectory in allocentric/egocentric coordinate space but by estimated utility transition during the observed behavior.",

        "abstract": "This paper introduces a home robot application of multi-channel based spatial noise reduction for creating human-robot speech interfaces. A microphone array is employed first to create a speech-only directional conduit, which is realized through adaptive beamforming. Through the directional conduit, the intended speech signal from the desired direction is processed for detection and recognition, while unintended speech-like-sources or undesirable noise from other angles is suppressed. If speech signal is absent among the incoming signals through the conduit, further attenuation of undesirable signals is achieved by using a spatial noise reduction filter. Experimental validation of the technique was conducted using a computer simulation and also an online Samsung AnyBot test. Although the environments exhibited highly non-stationary noise, the method achieved an average speech recognition rate of 87.4% in the case of the computer simulation and 81.6% for the online Samsung AnyBot test. From the cases tested so far, the proposed implementation seems to be effective for practical robot applications in highly non-stationary noise environment.",

Energy is used to define the metric on the configuration space. Once the projection is found the 6-DOF wrench can be computed. The configuration space is locally represented with exponential coordinates to make the algorithm more efficient. Numerical examples compare the proposed algorithm with the existing approaches and show its advantages.",

These simulations, classically used by the pharmaceutical industry, for example Sanofl-Aventis, are based on the energy description of atoms to estimate the interactions between a ligand and a protein. The main drawback is that forces and torques cannot be calculated by the means of a simple derivation. The proposed method is to locally build an energy model, the shape of which is correctly predetermined, depending on parameters to be estimated, themselves functions of the energy of the interatomic interactions and of the displacement of the haptic device. The interaction's wrench can be obtained using an analytic derivation of the energy model. The molecular simulator does not need to be optimized or modified, only the calculated interaction energy is used to build a model which will interact with the haptic device. This new method can then be used with any force field using a minimization process, ensuring stable manipulation, and a low- force dynamic, therefore allowing comprehensive and stable force feedback.",

The main difficulty of the enhancement lies on that heterogeneous piecewise equations of motions have to be handled at once, and seamless conditioning about the angular-momentum conservation and the body attitude before/after contact phase changing have to be achieved. For the former issue, multiple boundary conditions of piecewise differential equations are set up and solved in the same way with the original BCR. They are based on an approximately mass-concentrated biped model, so that contact state transition and severe time constraints are dealt with at low computational cost. Vertical-horizontal interference of COM trajectory is also taken into account by applying numerical solution of the initial value problem of differential equations. For the latter, a Jacobian-based inverse kinematics with a continuously-varying weight-blending in accordance with the shift of the contact state is presented.",

Three types of movements are recorded and used to perform the identification. We concluded that designed movements and movements from clinical diagnosis of neuromuscular diseases are good to perform the identification; however swing of the arms during normal walk does not provide enough excitation to obtain consistent results.",

In order to realize such system, the following is required: 1) detection of the reaching movements, 2) prediction of the target object among multiple objects, and 3) handing-over the object to a user. In this paper, the first two of them are discussed. To detect the reaching movements, we use the speed of a hand movement, the smoothness of the hand trajectory, and the relation between a position of hand and a gaze point. To predict the target object, we use a probabilistic model based on the user's hand movements and his/her gaze direction. The proposed system can detect reaching movements and predict the target object at a very early stage. A description of the experimental results demonstrates the advantage of the method proposed here.",

        "abstract": "Minimally invasive surgery is a technique that provides numerous benefits to the patient, but presents challenges to the surgeon in that dexterity, hand-eye coordination and haptic perception are compromised. Robot-assisted minimally invasive approaches have addressed the problems of dexterity and coordination; however, the lack of kinesthetic and tactile feedback remains a significant drawback. Despite many advances in this area, little is currently known about what level of feedback performance is adequate to allow the surgeon to palpate tissue to detect an underlying tumour. This paper describes experiments that were conducted on ex-vivo porcine lung, using artificial tumours, to elucidate one measure of sensor performance required to detect the presence of a tumour. The results indicate that a force- sensitive probe with a sensing range of 0 to 10 N and a resolution of 0.01 N would allow a tumour to be localized via palpation using kinesthetic feedback.",

        "abstract": "Limbs are an attractive approach to certain niche robotic applications, such as urban search and rescue, that require both small size and the ability to locomote through highly rubbled terrain. Unfortunately, a large number of degrees of freedom implies there is a large space of non- optimal locomotion trajectories (gaits), making gait adaptation critical. On the other hand, these extra degrees of freedom open many possibilities for active sensing of the terrain, which is essential information for adapting the gait. In previous work, we developed a metric for terrain classification that makes use of the loping body motion (i.e. gait bounce) during locomotion. In this work we present a framework for evolving gaits to better differentiate the gait bounce signal across terrains. This framework includes a limb/terrain interaction model that estimates gait bounce based on established models of wheel/terrain interaction, and an objective function that can be optimized for terrain discriminability. Additional objective functions for improved locomotion are presented, as well as culling agents that help guide the evolution process away from real-world impossibilities.",

In this paper, we present a tactile-driven approach that dynamically uses the robot's grasping experience to address this issue. During the grasp movement, the current contact information is used to dynamically adapt the grasping control by targeting the best matching posture from the experience base. Thus, the robot recalls and actuates a grasp it already successfully performed in a similar tactile context. To efficiently represent the experience, we introduce the grasp manifold assuming that grasp postures form a smooth manifold in hand posture space. We present a simple way of providing approximations of grasp manifolds using self-organising maps (SOMs). The algorithm is evaluated on three different geometry primitives - box, cylinder and sphere - in a physics-based computer simulation.",

An optical fiber probe has been developed to measure the tissue recovery precisely through a static indentation method. Ex-vivo soft tissue recovery tests have been conducted on porcine liver. A robotic manipulator is used to control the motion of the probe and the force sensor is used to record the interaction force at the tip of the probe. An empirical mathematical model which describes the relationship of the liver recovery behavior and the holding time during which the probe keeps the tissue statically indented has been developed. The error analysis shows this model is able to predict liver recovery reasonably well. The experimental study shows that the recovery behavior of soft tissue depends on the holding time of the probe. In addition, the formula of the recovering force of the liver, which was deduced from the rate of liver recovery, is proposed.",

        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "Recently, a new technique for generating periodic motions in mechanical systems which have less actuators than degrees of freedom has been proposed. A motivating example for studying such motions is a dynamically stabilized walking robot, where the target trajectory is periodic, and one of the joints - the ankle joint - is unactuated, or weakly actuated. In this paper, the technique is implemented on the Furuta pendulum, an experimental testbed that is simpler than a walking robot but retains many of the key challenges - it is underactuated, open-loop unstable, and practical problems such as friction and velocity estimation must be overcome. We present a detailed description of the practical implementation of the controller. The experiments show that the technique is sufficiently robust to be useful in practice.",

        "abstract": "This work aims at improving real-time motion control and dead-reckoning of wheeled skid-steer vehicles by considering the effects of slippage, but without introducing the complexity of dynamics computations in the loop. This traction scheme is found both in many off-the-shelf mobile robots due to its mechanical simplicity and in outdoor applications due to its maneuverability. In previous works, we reported a method to experimentally obtain an optimized kinematic model for skid-steer tracked vehicles based on the boundedness of the instantaneous centers of rotation (ICRs) of treads on the motion plane. This paper provides further insight on this method, which is now proposed for wheeled skid-steer vehicles. It has been successfully applied to a popular research robotic platform, pioneer P3-AT, with different kinds of tires and terrain types.",

The design and development of the mechanical flapping experimental testbed, which can flap a given wing/fin in three rotational degrees of freedom is presented in detail.

The main purpose of this work is to verify these theoretical properties in a real-world scenario. As a side contribution, a low-cost experimental setup is presented, based on the LEGO Mindstorms technology. The setup features good scalability, it is versatile enough to be adopted for the evaluation of different control strategies, and it exhibits several issues to be faced in real- world applications.",

The decision for invoking one of the reaction patterns is based on acceleration data measured during the impact. The experiments confirm that the robot is able to react swiftly, resembling the reaction patterns of humans.",

Successful corridor navigation is achieved through closed loop feedback of the first two spatial harmonics of the optic flow, which provide the lateral and rotational stiffness with respect to local obstacles required to stabilize a collision-free trajectory through the environment.",

In addition, the bucky gel device generates electromotive force when bending, and then it also can be used as a sensor. Since sensor and actuator functions exist in a same device, flexible and miniature integrated actuator-sensor systems for soft robotics can be constructed easily. In this study, we conduct some experiments to verify the possibility of the bucky gel actuator/sensor. Feedback controls of the actuator are demonstrated and the characteristics of the sensor are investigated. By utilizing both functions of the actuator and the sensor, feedback control based on the sensor signal is demonstrated.",

        "abstract": "This paper describes a new semi-blind source separation (semi-BSS) technique with independent component analysis (ICA) for enhancing a target source of interest and for suppressing other known interference sources. The semi BSS technique is necessary for double-talk free robot audition systems in order to utilize known sound source signals such as self speech, music, or TV-sound, through a line-in or ubiquitous network. Unlike the conventional semi-BSS with ICA, we use the time-frequency domain convolution model to describe the reflection of the sound and a new mixing process of sounds for ICA. In other words, we consider that reflected sounds during some delay time are different from the original. ICA then separates the reflections as other interference sources. The model enables us to eliminate the frame size limitations of the frequency-domain ICA, and ICA can separate the known sources under a highly reverberative environment. Experimental results show that our method outperformed the conventional semi-BSS using ICA under simulated normal and highly reverberative environments.",

        "abstract": "A cognitive robot system has to acquire and efficiently store vast knowledge about the world it operates in. To cope with every day tasks, a robot needs to learn, classify and recognize a manifold of different objects. Our work focuses on an object representation scheme that allows storing perceived objects in a compact way. This will enable the system to store extensive information about the world and will ease complex recognition tasks. The human visual system deploys several mechanisms to reduce the amount of information. Our goal is to develop an artificial system that mimics these mechanisms to create representations that can be used in cognitive tasks. In particular, in this paper we will present an approach that exploits similarities among different views of objects. The proposed representation scheme allows for reduction of storage required for the representation of objects and preserves the information about the similarity among objects. This is achieved by selecting 'important views' of objects, depending on their stability. Furthermore, by extending the same approach to multiple objects, we are able to exploit similarities between objects to find a common representation and to further reduce the storage requirements.",

This method proceeds by building a data structure called SRT (sensor-based random tree). The SRT represents a roadmap of the explored area with an associated safe region, and estimates the free space as perceived by the robot during the exploration. The original work presents two techniques: SRT-ball and SRT-star. In this paper, we propose an alternative strategy called SRT-radial that deals with non- holonomic constraints using two alternative planners named SRT-extensive and SRT-goal.

        "abstract": "Simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) for mobile robots has attracted research interests in the past two decades. Recent years, Rao-Blackwellized particle filter (RBPF) approach proved to be an effective means to estimate the full SLAM posterior. However, most of the SLAM practices are implemented in static environment. To navigate in dynamic environment, model based approaches have been implemented. The approaches require modeling, classification, and data association. Modeling and classification often require prior knowledge of the environment and are less robust in highly complex environment. To obviate modeling, classification and data association in dynamic environment, a solution framework based on Rao-Blackwellised genetic algorithmic filter (RBGAF) is extended for recovering the full SLAM posterior, using raw sensor measurements. The resultant extended RBGAF-SLAM recovers the negative sensor information during SLAM so that the moving objects can be efficiently identified in the particle maps. This approach permits the implementation of SLAM without prior knowledge of the environment and the static environment assumption. Simulations and experimental results obtained in an outdoor environment using a laser measurement system are presented to demonstrate the method's effectiveness.",

Therefore this paper investigates extended transparency as a performance measure in bilateral teleoperation. First, through an analysis based on control objective, extended transparency has two independent control objectives: trackability and immersivity. Second, we develop the performance measure for each control objective of extended transparency by using both the transmission delay constant and the error vector magnitude for the effect of time delay, and both the meaningful perception bandwidth and the compliance just-noticeable-difference for human haptic perception. Finally, extended transparency is applied to two kinds of control architecture in a one-DOF LTI teleoperation system. The case study and simulations demonstrate the ease of application and the validity of the proposed method.",

        "abstract": "In this paper, we describe a new approach for the extrinsic calibration of a camera with a 3D laser range finder, that can be done on the fly. This approach does not require any calibration object. Only few point correspondences are used, which are manually selected by the user from a scene viewed by the two sensors. The proposed method relies on a novel technique to visualize the range information obtained from a 3D laser scanner. This technique converts the visually ambiguous 3D range information into a 2D map where natural features of a scene are highlighted. We show that by enhancing the features the user can easily find the corresponding points of the camera image points. Therefore, visually identifying laser- camera correspondences becomes as easy as image pairing. Once point correspondences are given, extrinsic calibration is done using the well-known PnP algorithm followed by a noninear refinement process. We show the performance of our approach through experimental results. In these experiments, we will use an omnidirectional camera. The implication of this method is important because it brings 3D computer vision systems out of the laboratory and into practical use.",

The planning for arms with high-degree-of-freedom (DOF) is hard because its search space is large (exponential in the number of joints), and the links may collide with static obstacles or other joints (self-collision). In this paper we present a motion planning algorithm that finds plans of motion from one arm configuration to a goal arm configuration in 2D space assuming no self-collision. Our algorithm is unique in two ways: (a) it utilizes the topology of the arm and obstacles to factor the search space and reduce the complexity of the planning problem using dynamic programming; and (b) it takes only polynomial time in the number of joints under some conditions. We provide a sufficient condition for polytime motion planning for 2D-space arms: if there is a path between two homotopic configurations, an embedded local planner finds a path within a polynomial time. The experimental results show that the proposed algorithm improves the performance of path planning for 2D arms.",

Since robots usually have a plurality of uncoordinated sensors, our algorithm has an advantage over filtering-based estimation algorithms, which cannot incorporate delayed measurements optimally. We provide an implementation of the general fixed-lag smoothing algorithm using square root smoothing, a technique that has become prominent. Square root smoothing uses fast sparse matrix factorization and enables our fixed-lag pose estimation algorithm to run at upwards of 20 Hz. Our algorithm has been extensively tested over hundreds of hours of operation on a robot operating in outdoor environments. We present results based on these tests that verify our claims using wheel encoders, visual odometry, and GPS as sensors.",

        "abstract": "In this paper, the sampling real-time QMDP value method is proposed and applied to a goalkeeper task of a soccer robot. Soccer is a challenging task for an autonomous robot that has poor computing resources and sensors, and a good subject in the study of decision making in dynamic environments. A robot frequently decides its behavior without enough observation of the environment. In the proposed method, the risk of a score is solved beforehand toward every set of position of the goalkeeper and motion of the ball. The shortage of observation is calculated and represented by particle filters. The proposed method uses the risk function and the particle filters so as to choose appropriate behavior of the goalkeeper. The experiment with an actual robot suggests that the method can decide actions reflexively toward the motion of the ball.",

        "abstract": "SLAM has been one of the main focuses of attention in robotics research. In the last years, some new graphical solutions for this problem have been proposed, which are concerned about jointly determining the environment map and the robot localization history, a more specific problem known as Smoothing and Mapping (SAM). When applied to topological maps, Loopy Belief Propagation (LBP) provides an incremental and distributed solution to this problem, but eventually may incur time-consuming convergence. This work introduces the concept of starting points of belief propagation, a technique that can be used to reduce the convergence time of the LBP algorithm. We then propose an approach for determining starting points using information about the specific SAM graph structure in order to limit the number of iterations needed by LBP to provide an approximated global Maximum a Posteriori (MAP) estimate of the map and the robot trajectory. The experiments presented, performed with real-world data, confirm the adequacy of the proposed approach and encourage further investigation on it.",

        "abstract": "In this paper, a novel approach is proposed to recover human body pose from 3D voxel data. The use of voxel data leads to viewpoint-free estimation, which benefits in that reconstruction of a training model is needless in different multi- camera arrangements. Other notable aspects of our approach are real-time ensuring speed (up to 30[FPS]), flexibility towards various complex motions, and robustness towards voxel noise. The main concept of our approach is based on an example based approach. Human posture candidates are constructed beforehand from a large motion capture database, and the most appropriate posture is estimated per frame by comparing the likelihoods between 3D voxel data and posture candidates. The evaluation is formulated by introducing a histogram- based feature vector that represents the 3D shape context of human body. In addition, a fast near-neighbor search metric is installed prior to the evaluation process, in order to reduce the computational cost and ensure real-time processing. Estimation stability is also improved by a graphical model of motion, which adds a smoothing effect to the motion sequence. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach with experiments on both synthetic and real image sequences.",

        "abstract": "Reinforcement learning (RL) has been used as a learning mechanism for a mobile robot to learn state-action relations without a priori knowledge of working environment. However, most RL methods usually suffer from slow convergence to learn optimum state-action sequence. In this paper, it is intended to improve a learning speed by compounding an existing Q-learning method with a shortest path finding algorithm. To integrate the shortest path algorithm with Qlearning method, a stochastic state-transition model is used to store a previous observed state, a previous action and a current state. Whenever a robot reaches a goal, a Stochastic Shortest Path(SSP) will be found from the stochastic state-transition model. State-action pairs on the SSP will be counted as more significant in the action selection. Using this learning method, the learning speed will be boosted when compared with classical RL methods. To show the validity of our proposed learning technology, several simulations and experimental results will be illustrated",

Known objects are objects with known geometry, position, orientation, and configuration. Unkown objects are objects which have to be detected by a vision sensor but with unkown geometry, position, orientation and configuration. The known objects are modeled and expanded in 3D and then projected into a camera image. The camera image is classified into object areas including known and unknown objects and into non-object areas. The distance is conservatively estimated by searching for the largest expansion radius where the projected model does not intersect the object areas classified as unknown in the camera image. The method requires only minimal computation times and can be used for surveillance and safety applications.",

Robot systems take pictures with calibrated cameras from known positions and may simultaneously capture depth measurements in the scene. This allows known constraints on the 3D size and position of objects to be translated into constraints on potential locations and scales of objects in the image, eliminating potentially expensive image operations for geometrically infeasible object locations. We show this integration to be very natural in the context of face detection and find that the computational effort of the standard Viola Jones face detector (as implemented in OpenCV) can be reduced by 85 percent with three times fewer false positives.",

In the future, various tasks ranging from daily chores to safety-related tasks will be carried out by individual humanoid robots. If the importance of the tasks is different, the required dependability will also vary accordingly. Therefore, for mobile humanoid robots operating under power constraints, fault tolerance that dynamically changes based on the importance of the tasks is desirable because fault-tolerant designs involving hardware redundancy are power intensive. This paper proposes a taskbased dynamic fault tolerance scheme and a duplex computer system that is characterized by performing safety failover when the standby computer unit is in a cold standby state. Moreover, this paper presents the hardware design of the redundancy controller in which the safety failover subsystem is implemented.",

We explore how to methodically select a minimal set of hand pose features from optical marker data for grasp recognition. Supervised feature selection is used to determine a reduced feature set of surface marker locations on the hand that is appropriate for grasp classification of individual hand poses. Classifiers trained on the reduced feature set of five markers retain at least 92% of the prediction accuracy of classifiers trained on a full feature set of thirty markers. The reduced model also generalizes better to new subjects. The dramatic reduction of the marker set size and the success of a linear classifier from local marker coordinates recommend optical marker techniques as a practical alternative to data glove methods for observation learning of grasping.",

        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "Temporal classification, such as activity recognition, is a key component for creating intelligent robot systems. In the case of robots, classification algorithms must robustly incorporate complex, non-independent features extracted from streams of sensor data. Conditional random fields are discriminatively trained temporal models that can easily incorporate such features. However, robots have few computational resources to spare for computing a large number of features from high bandwidth sensor data, which creates opportunities for feature selection. Creating models that contain only the most relevant features reduces the computational burden of temporal classification. In this paper, we show that lscr1 regularization is an effective technique for feature selection in conditional random fields. We present results from a multi-robot tag domain with data from both real and simulated robots that compare the classification accuracy of models trained with lscr1 regularization, which simultaneously smoothes the model and selects features; lscr2 regularization, which smoothes to avoid over-fitting, but performs no feature selection; and models trained with no smoothing.",

        "track": "main",
        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "Tracking sonar features in real time on an underwater robot is a challenging task. One reason is the low observability of the sonar in some directions. For example, using a blazed array sonar one observes range and the angle to the array axis with fair precision. The angle around the axis is poorly constrained. This situation is problematic for tracking features in world frame Cartesian coordinates as the error surfaces will not be ellipsoids. Thus Gaussian tracking of the features will not work properly. The situation is similar to the problem of tracking features in camera images. There the unconstrained direction is depth and its errors are highly non-Gaussian. We propose a solution to the sonar problem that is analogous to the successful inverse depth feature parameterization for vision tracking, introduced by [1]. We parameterize the features by the robot pose where it was first seen and the range/bearing from that pose. Thus the 3D features have 9 parameters that specify their world coordinates. We use a nonlinear transformation on the poorly observed bearing angle to give a more accurate Gaussian approximation to the uncertainty. These features are tracked in a SLAM framework until there is enough information to initialize world frame Cartesian coordinates for them. The more compact representation can then be used for a global SLAM or localization purposes. We present results for a system running real time underwater SLAM/localization. These results show that the parameterization leads to greater consistency in the feature location estimates.",

        "abstract": "A robotic hand may change its grasp status and relocate some of its fingers in order to perform a large scale manipulation. Such a strategy is called a finger gait. In this paper, a randomized manipulation planning algorithm is proposed to solving the finger gait planning problem. One of the most used finger gaiting primitives, finger substitution, is introduced. Because of its discrete-continuous characteristics, the kinematics model of a finger substitution is formulated into a hybrid automaton. Considering the discrete and continuous topology of the automaton, both the discrete metric and continuous metric are defined on the state space. An improved RRT based planner is proposed to find a feasible finger substitution. Finally, simulation results verify the validity of the proposed finger gait planner.",

Therefore, a soft actuator loses its compliance when these sensors are used with the actuator. Thus, in this research, we have developed a flexible displacement sensor that can keep the compliance of a soft actuator. The fabricated flexible displacement sensor is composed of piezoelectric polymer, conductive paste and base rubber. Piezoelectric polymer: poly(vinylidene fluoride- trifluoroethylene) [P(VDF/TrFE)] was used for the detection of displacement and conductive paste was used for electrodes. An intelligent FMA (flexible microactuator) was developed by attaching these sensors. Displacement of the intelligent FMA and the sensor output voltage were compared, and sensing features were evaluated. Furthermore, servo control of the intelligent FMA using the sensor was performed. As a result, high positioning accuracy was verified.",

Without explicitly solving the inverse dynamics problem, the method can determine, by examining the Jacobian matrix of the manipulator, whether a feasible force solution exists. The equivalence (i.e., necessity and sufficiency) of the proposed method to an existing force-closure theorem developed for the robot grasping problem is mathematically proven and hence, this work rigorously shows, for the first time, that the theory for grasping problem is also applicable to cable manipulators. Moreover, a convex-analysis based simplification of the method is discussed.",

This paper introduces the first trajectory deformation scheme as an effort to improve path deformation. The main idea is that by incorporating the time dimension and hence information on the obstacles' future behaviour, quite a number of situations where path deformation would fail can be handled. The trajectory deformation scheme presented operates in two steps, ie, a collision avoidance step and a connectivity maintenance step, hence its name 2-step-trajectory-deformer (2-STD). In the collision avoidance step, repulsive forces generated by the obstacles deform the trajectory so that it remains collision-free. The purpose of the connectivity maintenance step is to ensure that the deformed trajectory remains feasible, ie, that it satisfies the robot's kinematic and/or dynamic constraints. Moreover, unlike path deformation wherein spatial deformation only takes place, 2-STD features both spatial and temporal deformation. It has been tested successfully on a planar robot with double integrator dynamics moving in dynamic environments.",

        "abstract": "In this paper, we studied how a mobile robot equipped with a 3D laser scanner can start from primitive behaviors and learn to use them to achieve goal-directed behaviors. For this purpose, we propose a learning scheme that is based on the concept of \"affordances\", where the robot first learns about the different kind of effects it can create in the environment and then links these effects with the perception of the initial environment and the executed primitive behavior. It uses these learned relations to create certain effects in the environment and achieve more complex behaviors.",

The control parameters found with this model are successfully used on the helicopter without re-tuning. The last part of this paper describes the control approach (integral backstepping) and the scheme we propose for full control of quadrotors (attitude, altitude and position).

In this video we show the robot's ability to map, detect and negotiate obstacles. The first part shows the robot exploring a test arena, that contains a pallet and a ramp, that have to be traversed. The second part demonstrates the autonomous stair climbing skill. The planning process uses a new concept called behavior maps, that has been developed to support planning while integrating obstacle negotiation.",

The mobile platform has two independent translations (T2) and three independent rotations (R3). A method is proposed for structural synthesis of fully-isotropic redundantly-actuated T2R3-type PMs based on the theory of linear transformations. A one-to-one correspondence exists between the actuated joint velocity space and the external velocity space of the moving platform. The Jacobian matrix mapping the two vector spaces of fully-isotropic T2R3-type PMs presented in this paper is 5 times 5 identity matrix throughout the entire workspace. The condition number and the determinant of the Jacobian matrix being equal to one, the manipulator performs very well with regard to force and motion transmission capabilities. Redundant actuation is used to obtain fully-isotropic solutions. This paper presents for the first time in the literature the use of redundancy to design fully- isotropic T2R3-type PMs.",

        "abstract": "Within the next years a new generation of humanoid robots able to manage autonomously sophisticated tasks in a complex, time varying domestic and public environment is going to be developed. To cope with these advanced requirements a new multi-sensor based discrete- continuous supervisory control concept is proposed, which is able to accomplish even complex human skills. Each skill is divided into a sequence of elementary actions (so called Primitive Skills). Depending on the multi-sensor perception of the current state of the system, the discrete control has to provide an optimal selection and activation of the appropriate sequence of action and control strategy. An on-line decision making algorithm based on the structure of Primitive Skills (PS) has been implemented. On a lower level the continuous control has to assure that each PS is performed by means of the most appropriate sub-controllers. The theoretical approach and first experimental results of the ongoing research are presented in this paper.",

Implementation of this approach is based on the design and optimization of fuzzy logic controller (FLC) performed in two stages. In the first stage, the FLC parameters are trained and optimized offline using a rapid prototyping algorithm combined with a method based on Solis and Wetts algorithm. The latter algorithm allows convergence of the cost function to its global minimum by using a local search algorithm which is a randomized hill-climber with an adaptive step size. For convenience of analysis, the structure of the FLC is divided into multi-input-single-output (MISO) controllers. In the second stage, an online learning of the FLC is then implemented into the proposed control structure. Robustness of the proposed approach is shown by the stability analysis based on the Lyapunov method. To show the performances of the proposed approach, simulations are carried out on a 3DOF robot performing contour following under force constraints.",

In particular, motion and observation models are learned from training examples using Gaussian process (GP) regression. The state estimator is an unscented Kalman filter (UKF). The resulting GP-UKF algorithm has a number of advantages over standard (parametric) UKFs. These include the ability to estimate the state of arbitrary nonlinear systems, improved tracking quality compared to a parametric UKF, and graceful degradation with increased model uncertainty. These advantages stem from the fact that GPs consider both the noise in the system and the uncertainty in the model. If an approximate parametric model is available, it can be incorporated into the GP; resulting in further performance improvements. In experiments, we show how the GP-UKF algorithm can be applied to the problem of tracking an autonomous micro-blimp.",

The seven different configurations are 1) single frequency code differential DGPS, 2) double frequency code differential DGPS, 3) RTK-GPS receiving RTCM correction from a mobile phone, 4) RTK-GPS receiving RTCM correction information via wireless module from base antenna, 5) StarFire WADGPS, 6) StarFire-DGPS dual mode and 7) StarFire-RTK GPS dual mode. As GPS is mostly used in loosely coupled configurations where receiver output is fused with other sensors, the contribution of this paper is the statistical comparison in two dimensions of different GPS configurations using as performance index availability, precision (using standard deviation parameters of each measurement) and reliability. Two types of study environments were tested, open sky and under tree shading. Time for re-acquiring fix solution for RTK-GPS configurations and re-acquiring dual frequency solution by dual frequency configurations are discussed as well. Finally, experimental measurement results show how under tree shading, biased position data with small covariance can be rejected thresholding measurements with small HDOP values and large number of satellites used for solution.",

        "abstract": "This work focuses on the relevance of visual attention in affordance-inspired robotics. Among all approaches in robotics related to Gibson's concept of affordances the dealing with attention cues is only rudimentary. We are introducing this concept within the perception layer of our affordance-inspired robotic framework. In this context we present a high-performance visual attention system handling invariants in the optical array. This layer builds the base of higher-sophisticated tasks, like a \"curiosity drive\" that helps a robotic agent to explore its environment. Our attention system derived from VOCUS utilizes the parallel design of the graphics processing unit (GPU) and reaches real-time performance for the processing of online video streams in VGA resolution on a single computer platform. GPU-VOCUS is currently the fastest known visual attention system running on standard personal computers.",

        "abstract": "For humanoid robots to fully realize their biped potential in a three-dimensional world and step over, around or onto obstacles such as stairs, appropriate and efficient approaches to execution, planning and perception are required. To this end, we have accelerated a robust model-based three-dimensional tracking system by programmable graphics hardware to operate online at frame-rate during locomotion of a humanoid robot. The tracker recovers the full 6 degree-of- freedom pose of viewable objects relative to the robot. Leveraging the computational resources of the GPU for perception has enabled us to increase our tracker's robustness to the significant camera displacement and camera shake typically encountered during humanoid navigation. We have combined our approach with a footstep planner and a controller capable of adaptively adjusting the height of swing leg trajectories. The resulting integrated perception-planning-action system has allowed an HRP-2 humanoid robot to successfully and rapidly localize, approach and climb stairs, as well as to avoid obstacles during walking.",

However, those robots can exercise only in the sagittal plane. This paper extends this control method to generate three-dimensional motion for gymnastics robots having an ankle joint pivoted at the floor. This ankle joint has two orthogonal axes and can not be actuator-driven. In order to maneuver intrinsically unstable robots, we propose an extended ZMM method by redefining the ZMM as a (n-2)- dimensional configuration manifold for such robots with n joints. It is shown theoretically that any motion toward the target pose starting from any given posture on a subset of the ZMM can be stabilized by using this extended ZMM control. Some simulation results of a 10-DOF gymnastics robot model show the effectiveness of the proposed method.",

        "abstract": "The purpose of evaluation procedures is to achieve both qualitative and quantitative statements on haptic rendering realism and performance. Since a haptic interface provides an interaction between a user and a virtual environment, fidelity of a haptic interface directly affects the performance. To our knowledge, a standard, generic and reusable validation method which comprehensively addresses all the attributes of haptic feedback has not been realized yet. Despite the large number of human factor studies, only few of them have been proposed as well for haptic interface performance measurements. For this reason, we review validation procedures for haptic rendering and propose an evaluation method based on testbeds to obtain a systematic haptic interface assessment. We integrated the approaches of human factor studies into the testbeds to obtain a simple and yet complete measure of human-machine interaction performance. The testbeds were tested on a haptic interface, the IHP of Xitact SA, and performance results are presented. In the testbeds, performance metrics for generic haptic interaction tasks are expressed in terms of information transfer (bits) and sensory thresholds which are indeed device specific benchmark metrics. Thus, the suitability of a haptic interface for a defined task can be verified, device comparisons become possible and the obtained information can be used to identify possible improvements.",

        "abstract": "One primary goal in rescue robotics is to deploy a team of robots for coordinated victim search after a disaster. This requires robots to perform sub- tasks, such as victim detection, in real-time. Human detection by computationally cheap techniques, such as color thresholding, turn out to produce a large number of false-positives. Markov Random Fields (MRFs) can be utilized to combine the local evidence of multiple weak classifiers in order to improve the detection rate. However, inference in MRFs is computational expensive. In this paper we present a novel approach for the genetic optimizing of the building process of MRF models. The genetic algorithm determines offline relevant neighborhood relations with respect to the data, which are then utilized for generating efficient MRF models from video streams during runtime. Experimental results clearly show that compared to a Support Vector Machine (SVM) based classifier, the optimized MRF models significantly reduce the false-positive rate. Furthermore, the optimized models turned out to be up to five times faster then the non-optimized ones at nearly the same detection rate.",

        "abstract": "One of the potential benefits of robotic systems in cardiac surgery is that their use can increase the number of possible off-pump (beating heart) coronary artery bypass grafting procedures. Robotic systems can actively synchronize the motion of surgical tools to the motion of the surface of the heart, with the surgeon specifying only the relative motion of the tool with respect to the heart. Accurate prediction of the motion of the heart surface is obviously of crucial importance for the safety and robustness of such a system. This paper presents a novel approach to predict the motion of the surface of a beating heart. We show how ECG and respiratory information can be used to extract two periodic components from the quasi-periodic motion of the heart surface. Contrary to most existing literature, we consider the full geometric motion, including rotation due to respiration. We then show how to combine the periodic components to accurately predict future motion of the heart surface, and how this information can be used to design an explicit controller that asymptotically stabilizes the relative motion of the surgical tool to a desired relative distance and orientation.",

        "abstract": "Grasp synthesis on real 3D objects is a critical problem in grasp and manipulation planning. This paper presents a geometrical approach to compute force closure (FC) grasps, with or without friction and with any number of fingers. The object's surface is discretized in a cloud of points, so the algorithm is applicable to objects of any arbitrary shape. One or more FC grasps are obtained with a geometrical approach, which embeds the FC test in the algorithm to simplify achieving the force-closure property. This initial FC grasp may be improved with a complementary optimization algorithm. The grasp quality is measured considering the largest perturbation wrench that the grasp can resist with independence of the perturbation direction. The efficiency of both algorithms is illustrated through numerical examples.",

        "abstract": "Unlike traditional rigid-linked robots, soft robotic manipulators can bend into a wide variety of complex shapes due to control inputs and gravitational loading. This paper presents a new approach for modeling the dynamics of soft robotic manipulators that incorporates the effect of material nonlinearities and distributed and payload weight and is geometrically exact for the large curvature, shear, torsion and extension that often occur in these manipulators. The model is based on the general Cosserat theory of rods and a fiber reinforced model of air muscle actuators. The model is validated experimentally on the OctArm V manipulator, showing less that 5% average error for a wide range of actuation pressures and base orientations as compared to almost 50% average error for the constant curvature model previously used by researchers.",

We propose an algorithm for mobile robots equipped with color cameras that allows for smooth operation under illumination changes. The robot uses image statistics and the environmental structure to autonomously detect and adapt to both major and minor illumination changes. Furthermore, the robot autonomously plans an action sequence that maximizes color learning opportunities while minimizing localization errors.

        "abstract": "This paper presents a method to perform localization in urban environments using segment-based maps together with particle filters. In the proposed approach, the likelihood function is generated as a grid, derived from segment-based maps. The scheme can efficiently assign weights to the particles in real time, with minimum memory requirements and without any additional pre-filtering procedure. Multi-hypotheses cases are handled transparently by the filter. A local history-based observation model is formulated as an extension to deal with 'out-of-map' navigation cases. This feature is highly desirable since the map can be incomplete, or the vehicle can be actually located outside the boundaries of the provided map. The system behaves like a 'virtual GPS', providing global localization in urban environments, without using an actual GPS. Experimental results show the performance of the proposed architecture in large scale urban environments using route network description (RNDF) segment-based maps.",

        "abstract": "In this paper, we present two methods for the estimation of a globally valid visual-motor model of a robotic manipulator. In conventional uncalibrated visual servoing, the visuo-motor function is approximated locally with a Jacobian. However, for optimal task planning, or nonlinear controller design with global stability guarantee, one needs to know a model that provides some information about the behavior of the system over the whole workspace. Our presented methods remedy this drawback in uncalibrated visual servoing by incrementally building a global estimator based on the movement history. We implement two such methods. The first method is a K-nearest neighborhood regressor over Jacobian that uses previously estimated local models. The second method stores previous movements and computes an estimate of the Jacobian by solving a local least squares problem. Experimental results show that both methods provide better global estimation quality compared to the conventional local estimation method with much lower estimation variance.",

It first shows that commonly used approaches such as assumptive planning can result in very long and costly robot traverses. It then shows how one can solve the same problem using a general probabilistic planner we have recently developed called PPCP (Probabilistic Planning with Clear Preferences). The paper also introduces two optimizations to the PPCP algorithm that make it run up to five times faster for our domain. The experimental results show that solving the problem with PPCP can substantially reduce the expected execution cost as compared to assumptive planning.",

It is based on a flexible building block method, called Flexln, which uses an evolutionary approach, to optimize a truss-like structure made of building blocks. From the first design step, in addition to conventional mechanical criteria, dynamic gramian- based metrics can be considered in the optimization procedure to fit expected frequency responses of the synthesized mechanisms. A planar monolithic compliant coupling structure is obtained by the optimal design method to act as a stroke amplifier for piezoelectric stacked actuators, to operate in both static and dynamic motions, and to passively filter out undesirable vibrations. Finally, performance comparisons between some of the pseudo-optimal Flexln synthetized compliant mechanisms demonstrate the interests of the proposed optimization method for the design of dynamic operating smart microrobotic structures.",

Recently these solutions have been extended to map large environments with six degrees of freedom (DoF) poses. To demonstrate the capabilities of these SLAM algorithms it is common practice to present the generated maps and successful loop closing. Unfortunately there is often no objective performance metric that allows to compare different approaches. This fact is attributed to the lack of ground truth data. For this reason we present a novel method that is able to generate this ground truth data based on reference maps. Further on, the resulting reference path is used to measure the absolute performance of different 6D SLAM algorithms building a large urban outdoor map.",

Crawled vehicles, because of their terrain adaptability, have a considerable importance for rescue operations and tasks performed in unstructured environments. In this contribution we present the newest version of HELIOS robot (HELIOS VIII). It consists of the same mechanical concept introduced with its predecessor. Nevertheless all the efficient motion capabilities of HELIOS concept were maintained and improved. In this paper we will focus a lot on the development of a new gripper for HELIOS vehicle. It consists of four fingers actuated by one actuator and they can adapt to the grasped object surface. Besides we introduce also a special docking mechanism utilized for the connection of the vehicle with auxiliary crawler units.",

        "abstract": "The requirements for planetary manipulation systems are becoming more stringent with time. Missions are moving beyond simple driving and instrument placement to include sample handling, target selection from meters away, and precision re-sampling of a location. In one of these tasks, remote target selection, the target is selected in a high-viewpoint camera pair. The rover begins tracking the target in these cameras as the rover approaches the target. When the rover gets close enough that the target is in view of the low-viewpoint cameras, target handoff occurs. Target handoff is the process of identifying the same target in each set of cameras so that the low-viewpoint cameras can commence tracking. Tracking is then done in the lower cameras until the rover is within optimal range for manipulation operations. Target handoff also has applications in areas such as surveillance, security, and multi-viewpoint tracking. Planetary manipulation systems typically employ two sets of calibrated stereo cameras to achieve precision on the order of one centimeter or ten pixels. As imprecision in handoff translates to location error of the final sample, this level of precision is not sufficient for upcoming missions. By utilizing the method of hybrid image-plane/stereo (HIPS), initially developed for visually guided manipulation, handoffs have been achieved with errors of about one and a half pixels.",

        "abstract": "Locomotion on an irregular surface is a challenging task in robotics. Among different problems to solve to obtain robust locomotion, visually guided locomotion and accurate foot placement are of crucial importance. Robust controllers able to adapt to sensory-motor feedbacks, in particular to properly place feet on specific locations, are thus needed. Dynamical systems are well suited for this task as any online modification of the parameters leads to a smooth adaptation of the trajectories, allowing a safe integration of sensory-motor feedback. In this contribution, as a first step in the direction of locomotion on irregular surfaces, we present a controller that allows hand placement during crawling in a simulated humanoid robot. The goal of the controller is to superimpose rhythmic movements for crawling with discrete (i.e. short-term) modulations of the hand placements to reach specific marks on the ground.",

Focusing on two-dimensional planar objects and two finger grasps for simplicity, we present a principled approach for selecting contact points by analyzing the risk of force closure failure. The key contribution of this paper is the development of a method that incorporates shape uncertainty into grasp stability analysis. We propose a grasp quality metric that can be used to identify stable contact regions in the face of shape and contact location uncertainty. The proposed method successfully distinguishes grasps that are equivalent without uncertainty, and we illustrate the properties of this technique with simulation experiments in two classes of objects.",

        "abstract": "Executing plans by mobile robots, in real world environments, faces the challenging issues of uncertainty and environment dynamics. Thus, execution monitoring is needed to verify that plan actions are executed as expected. Semantic domain-knowledge has been proposed as a source of information to derive and monitor implicit expectations of executing actions. For instance, when a robot moves into a room asserted to be an office, it would expect to see a desk and a chair. We propose to extend the semantic knowledge-based execution monitoring to take uncertainty in actions and sensing into account when verifying the expectations derived from semantic knowledge. We consider symbolic probabilistic action models, and show how semantic knowledge is used together with a probabilistic sensing model in the monitoring process of such actions. Our approach is illustrated by showing test scenarios run in an indoor environment using a mobile robot.",

In an initial step a reference model of the environment is created and changes are then detected with respect to the reference model as differences in coloured 3D point clouds, which are obtained from a 3D laser range scanner and a CCD camera. The suggested approach introduces several novel aspects, including a registration method that utilizes local visual features to determine point correspondences (thus essentially working without an initial pose estimate) and the 3D-NDT representation with adaptive cell size to efficiently represent both the spatial and colour aspects of the reference model. Apart from a detailed description of the individual parts of the difference detection system, a qualitative experimental evaluation in an indoor lab environment is presented, which demonstrates that the suggested system is able register and detect changes in spatial 3D data and also to detect changes that occur in colour space and are not observable using range values only.",

        "abstract": "A mobile robot can be a rather significant source of noise: noisy fans cool onboard computers, motors are spinning, rubber wheels are squeaking against the floor, and mechanical parts are grinding against each other. Despite these noise problems, robots are often suggested as ideal security and surveillance tools, since they can reliably patrol an area, and remove people from harms way. While the arguments for using a robot are persuasive, the use of a noisy robot for these tasks is questionable. Certainly, they might allow a human to be separated from immediate harm, but given the ease with which people and/or machines can detect changes in the ambient noise, a noisy robot might not be very effective at performing its duties. One solution is to make very small, very quiet robots. But such small robots do not usually do very much either, as their sensing and computational power is minimal. An alternative solution is to use a larger robot, but make the robot aware of its own acoustic signature. Combined with knowledge about sound sources and sound flow through the environment, an acoustically aware robot may hide its own acoustic signature in the ambient noise to reduce the risk of being detected.",

We show through simplified aerodynamic models that not only do sinusoidal actuator drives produce close to maximal lift, but significantly improved wing trajectories due to non-sinusoidal actuator drives are practically unobtainable due to actuator limitations.",

        "abstract": "This paper introduces our recently developed high precision robot localization system employing position sensitive detectors (PSD). A lateral effect PSD is an ideal position sensitive device with a resolution of approx. 0.5 mum. Such a device can be used to enhance the precision capabilities of robot localization or robot calibration. The developed PSD guided localization system is comprised of a structured laser pointer system attached to the robot end-effector and a PSD fixture. It is capable of feeding back the movement information of the TCP relative to the PSD frame. This is achieved by detecting the position of the laser beams emitted from the laser pointers onto the PSD surface. The system was well designed, mapped, and constructed and hence allows it to perform precision localization of the robot. Simulations and preliminary experiments demonstrated the effectiveness of the developed PSD guided localization system including hardware, software, and algorithms. Therefore, it is capable of improving the localization performance of robots as well as promoting the application of precision robot calibration.",

Coded structured light projection methods have been proposed for acquiring three-dimensional images. Most of them are not suitable for measuring high-speed phenomena because the errors are caused when the measured objects move due to light projection of multiple patterns. In this paper, we propose a new coded structured light projection method that can select not only a temporal encoding but also a spatial encoding adaptively for obtaining three-dimensional images at a high-speed frame rate. We also develop an evaluation system that uses a DLP projector and an off-line high-speed video camera, and verify the effectiveness of the proposed method by showing the obtained three-dimensional shapes for moving objects.",

        "abstract": "This paper presents a new type of omnidirectional and holonomic mobile platform with a four-wheel-drive (4WD) mechanism for improving traction of electric wheelchairs on slippery surfaces and enhancing mobility on rough terrain. The 4WD mechanism includes a pair of normal wheels on the rear and a pair of omniwheels on the front. The normal wheel in rear and the omniwheel in front on the same side of the drive mechanism are connected by a power transmission to rotate in unison with a common motor. Omniwheels enable the front of the mechanism to roll freely from side to side. A third motor turns the chair about a vertical axis at the center of the mobile platform Thus the platform is controlled by three motors, no redundancy and no motor confliction are found on the drive system High step climb capability of the 4WD mechanism solves the insufficient mobility problem and the omnidirectional control enables simple and easy operation with no complicated maneuvering. To verify the availability of the proposed mobile system for wheelchairs, a prototype is designed and built. The fundamental step climb capability and holonomic and omnidirectional mobility are verified by a series of experiments.",

The particle filtering framework enables the fusion of visual cues, both into an importance function from which the particles are sampled, and into a measurement model used for weights definition. The multi-cues associations prove to be more robust than any of the cues individually. For the purpose of gestures recognition, a tracker is proposed which handles multiple hand configurations templates. Finally, implementation and experiments on a tour-guide robot are presented in order to highlight the relevance and complementarity of the developed visual functions. Extensions are finally discussed.",

        "abstract": "There has been little previous research assessing people\u2019s emotions and cognitions in response to different types of robot behaviour. This study investigated how people think and feel during interactions with robots who behave either well or poorly. 45 participants interacted with a B21r robot in a basic task to lead the robot along a marked path. Each participant was randomly assigned to either the robot following well or the robot following poorly. The most frequently reported emotions were frustration, fear, and happiness, and people commonly reported thoughts about the robot and also about themselves in the interaction. People reported more positive emotions in response to the good robot. Independently of group assignment, positive emotions during the task were associated with more positive evaluations of the robot and negative emotions were associated with more negative evaluations. These results suggest that robot designers should seek to maximize people\u2019s positive emotions and minimize negative emotions to maximise the quality of human-robot interactions. Results also suggest that recognising emotions may be difficult for robots, and direct questioning may be an easier strategy.",

However, since such a model is difficult to obtain, then the robotics interface must observe accurately the subject's behaviour when interacting with him. We present here a new human-robot interface for active interaction with the cognitive and emotional human domains. Since eye movements convey a lot of information about one subject's cognitive and emotive status, we have designed a new human-robot interface which uses a video-based Eye-Tracker (ET) to observe the subject's line of gaze. Since we are also interested in using our interface for studying and treating depression, our interface can send stimulating inputs to the subject using both a Transcranial Magnetic Stimulator (TMS) and a visual stimulus. The latter elicits the subject's emotions and consists of a set of pictures of facial expressions, which have been shown according to a novel visualization protocol, called Memory-Guided Filtering (MGF). Its effectiveness has been verified by means of many experimental results. We also present the application of our human-robot interface for preliminary studies concerning new cognitive rehabilitation strategies in depression.",

We propose a \"whole body contact motion\" of a humanoid robot. It is defined as a control of contact state of a humanoid robot which has the distributed tactile sensors. We develop conformable and scalable tactile skin and an adult-size humanoid with a smooth surfaces for arbitrary contact. We install the skin on the entire surfaces of the humanoid.

        "abstract": "This paper presents a hybrid localization scheme for a mobile robot using the hierarchical atlas. The hierarchical atlas is a map that consists of a higher level topological graph with lower level feature-based metric submaps associated with the graph edges. Our method employs both a discrete Bayes filter and a Kalman filter to localize the robot in the map. This framework accommodates localization in a map with no prior information (global localization) and localization in a map with an incorrect pose estimate (kidnapped robot). Our approach efficiently scales to large environments without sacrificing accuracy or robustness. We have verified our method with large-scale experiments in a multi-floor office environment.",

Our approach presents an alternative to the routing algorithms used in wireless sensor networks which focus on the minimization of energy consumption of each node which is mainly due to data transmission. The method has two layers: i) Reactive Layer in which the data collected from a sensor node is modelled as a potential function whose gradient attracts the robot and ii) Planning Layer, that dictates the action the robot must take to collect sensor data. Results from both simulation and real world experiments showing the performance of the proposed methodology are shown, compared and discussed.",

        "abstract": "the piezoelectric actuator (PEA) accuracy is limited due to hysteresis nonlinearity as well as mechanical loading effect. Investigation of the fundamental properties of the piezoceramics depicts that the external mechanical loads cause inclination in hysteresis loop can deteriorate tracking performance furthermore. Other limiting problem is the rate dependency of hysteresis nonlinearity in PEA. Herein a new controller scheme to compensate mentioned limiting factors in PEA is presented. In this study an adaptive inverse control method based on modified Prandtle-Ishlinskii operator is proposed. It compensates both the rate dependant hysteresis nonlinearity and the mechanical loading effect in PEA. The controller structure has a simple design and can be quickly identified. The control system is capable to achieve suitable tracking control only by measuring the applied external load and rate of control input. Therefore it is convenient to use and can be quickly applied to the practical PEA applications. To verify the efficiency of the proposed method, we have conducted simulation by using the PEA system model as the unknown piezo actuator (PEA) dynamic.",

The article focuses on decentralized reinforcement learning (RL) in cooperative MAS, where a team of independent learning robots (IL) try to coordinate their individual behavior to reach a coherent joint behavior. We assume that each robot has no information about its teammates' actions. To date, RL approaches for such ILs did not guarantee convergence to the optimal joint policy in scenarios where the coordination is difficult. We report an investigation of existing algorithms for the learning of coordination in cooperative MAS, and suggest a Q-learning extension for ILs, called hysteretic Q-learning. This algorithm does not require any additional communication between robots. Its advantages are showing off and compared to other methods on various applications: bi-matrix games, collaborative ball balancing task and pursuit domain.",

The KF-based localization design incorporates the wheel slip estimation and utilizes robot velocity constraints and estimates to overcome the large drift resulting from the integration of the IMU acceleration measurements. The estimation methodology is tested and validated experimentally with a computer vision- based localization system.",

Therefore, the various massage points, such as the change of the stiffness of human skin muscle, can be controlled by using impedance control method. The hybrid impedance control is comprised of the two methods of the position-based and the force-based impedance control were applied. The position-based impedance control is used to control the lateral position of massage on the human skin muscle. On the other hand, the force-based impedance control is used to control the force of the vertical direction on human skin muscle. This paper also gives the identification of human skin muscle through robot perception of impedance to decide the parameter of impedance controller. The control strategy using impedance control to implement an adaptive control system is presented, when human condition is changed with soft and hard skin muscle. Effectiveness of massage control system by using multi- fingered robot hand with hybrid impedance control is demonstrator through actual massage experiments of pushing and rubbing motion.",

Most devices consist of an articulated mechanical structure introducing distortions between the operator and the explored world. This distortion must be identified in order to assess the quality of the interface. The least-squares (LS) regressions are often used because of their simplicity. However, if the identification process takes place when the device is controlled by feedback, then the LS estimator is biased. To verify the reliability of the results, the bias of the estimator must be evaluated. This paper deals with this issue and introduces the design and the application of a derivate of the CESTAC method.",

        "abstract": "In addition to possessing a number of other important properties, kinematically redundant manipulators are inherently more tolerant to locked-joint failures than non- redundant manipulators. However, a joint failure can still render a kinematically redundant manipulator useless if the manipulator is poorly designed or controlled. This paper focuses on the implementation issues involved in identifying a region of the workspace for which task completion is guaranteed in the event of a locked-joint failure for a general class of planar 3R manipulators. The existence of such a region, called a failure-tolerant workspace, will be guaranteed by imposing a suitable set of artificial joint limits prior to a failure. The authors have developed a graphical user interface (GUI) that computes all workspace boundaries of interest for the planar 3R manipulators. This GUI allows the user to explore different robot geometries, and adjust the artificial joint limits, in an attempt to gain further understanding of a manipulator's failure-tolerant workspace.",

A typical problem occurred in the motion control, which has been identified through experimental experiences, is skidding of the mobile wheel. It sometimes results in uncertain rotation of the steering wheel. This is due to mismatching between the command and the mechanical hardware. To cope with this problem, a motion planning algorithm pursuing the natural configuration of the mobile wheel was mainly investigated, which resolves the skidding problem and uncertain motions of the steering wheel. Through simulations and experimentation, the feasibility of this algorithm was verified.",

        "abstract": "Range sensors are popular for localization since they directly measure the geometry of the local environment. Another distinct benefit is their typically high accuracy and spatial resolution. It is a well-known problem, however, that the high precision of these sensors leads to practical problems in probabilistic localization approaches such as Monte Carlo localization (MCL), because the likelihood function becomes extremely peaked if no means of regularization are applied. In practice, one therefore artificially smoothes the likelihood function or only integrates a small fraction of the measurements. In this paper we present a more fundamental and robust approach, that provides a smooth likelihood model for entire range scans. Additionally, it is location-dependent. In practical experiments we compare our approach to previous methods and demonstrate that it leads to a more robust localization.",

The robot actively cancels heart motion by closely following a point of interest (POI) on the heart surface -- a process called active relative motion canceling (ARMC). Due to the high bandwidth of the POI motion, it is necessary to supply the controller with an estimate of the immediate future of the POI over a prediction horizon. In this paper, a prediction algorithm, using an adaptive filter to generate future position estimates, is implemented and studied. The effects of predictor parameters on tracking performance are studied. Finally, the predictor is evaluated using a 3 degrees of freedom test-bed and prerecorded heart motion data.",

        "abstract": "We propose to improve the locomotive performance of humanoid robots by using approximated biped stepping and walking dynamics with reinforcement learning (RL). Although RL is a useful non-linear optimizer, it is usually difficult to apply RL to real robotic systems - due to the large number of iterations required to acquire suitable policies. In this study, we first approximated the dynamics by using data from a real robot, and then applied the estimated dynamics in RL in order to improve stepping and walking policies. Gaussian processes were used to approximate the dynamics. By using Gaussian processes, we could estimate a probability distribution of a target function with a given covariance function. Thus, RL can take the uncertainty of the approximated dynamics into account throughout the learning process. We show that we can improve stepping and walking policies by using a RL method with the approximated models both in simulated and real environments.

        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "This paper introduces a new approach to the problem of simultaneously localizing a team of mobile robots equipped with proprioceptive sensors able to monitor their motion and with exteroceptive sensors able of sensing one another. The method is based on a series of extended Kalman filters hierarchically distributed. In particular, the team is decomposed in several groups and, for each group, an extended Kalman filter estimates the configurations of all the members of the group in a local frame attached to one robot, the group leader. Finally, at the highest level of the hierarchy, one single filter estimates the locations of all the group leaders. The key advantage of this approach is its ability to distribute the computation necessary to perform the multi robot localization under limited computation and communication capabilities. In particular, the approach significantly outperforms an optimal approach based on a single estimator. This is shown by analytically computing the precision on the localization of each robot in the case of one single degree of freedom. In particular, the best hierarchy is analytically determined by deriving the dependency of the localization precision on the communication and computation capabilities and on the sensors accuracy.",

The preliminary models were in accordance with data obtained in experiments performed in the carotid artery of a living swine where a 1.5 mm sphere was propelled with a velocity of 13 cm/s.

This approach has a number of limitations for minimal access surgery, such as narrow angle imaging, limited workspace, counter-intuitive motions and additional incisions for the endoscpic instruments. Our intent is to go beyond this paradigm, and remotize sensors and effectors directly into the body cavity. To this end, we have developed a prototype of a novel insertable pan/tilt endoscopic camera with an integrated light source. The package has a size of 110 mm in length and 10 mm in diameter and can be inserted into the abdomen through a standard trocar and then anchored onto the abdominal wall, leaving the incision port open for access. The camera package contains three parts: an imaging module, an illumination module, and a pan/tilt motion platform. The imaging module includes a lens and CCD imaging sensor. The illumination module attaches to the imaging module and has an array of LED light sources. The pan/tilt platform provides the imaging module with pan of 120 degrees and tilt motion of 90 degrees using small servo motors. A fixing mechanism is designed to hold the device in the cavity. A standard joy stick can be used to control the motion of the camera in a natural way. The design allows for multiple camera packages to be inserted through a single incision as well.",

It is more realistic, practical, and efficient to take advantages of observation of skilled players than to discover new skills and necessary information only through the interaction of a learner and an environment. The learner automatically detects state variables and a goal of the behavior through the observation based on mutual information.

We use a recently introduced version of the incremental SVM, which allows to control the memory requirements as the system updates its internal representation. At the same time, it preserves the recognition performance of the batch algorithm. In order to assess the method, we acquired a database capturing the intrinsic variability of places over time.

In this work, we formulate the Coordinated Task Selection Problem (CTSP) to form the basis of an efficient dynamic task selection scheme for allocation of interrelated tasks of a complex mission to the members of a multi-robot team. Since processing times of tasks are not exactly known in advance, the incremental task selection scheme for the eligible tasks prevents redundant efforts as, instead of scheduling all of the tasks, they are allocated to robots as needed. This approach results in globally efficient solutions through mechanisms that form priority based rough schedules and select the most suitable tasks from these schedules. Since our method is targeted at real world task execution, communication requirements are kept limited. Empirical evaluations of the proposed approach are performed on the Webots simulator and the real robots. The results validate that the proposed approach is scalable, efficient and suitable to the real world safe mission achievement.",

It is true that many kinds of localization techniques have been researched for several years in order to contribute to realize ubiquitous system; particularly, such a ubiquitous system needs much highly precise accuracy to be practical and efficient. However, a number of localization systems for indoor space do not unfortunately have enough accuracy to establish any special task such as precise position control of moving target even though they have comparatively high developed cost. Therefore, we developed Indoor Mobile Localization System having high localization performance; specifically, the Unscented Kalman Filter is applied for improving the localization accuracy. In addition, we also present the additive filter named \u2018Pre-filtering\u2019 to compensate the performance of estimation algorithm. Pre-filtering has been developed to overcome bad effect from unexpected external noise so that localization through Unscented Kalman Filter has come to be stable. Moreover, we tried to demonstrate the performance comparison of the Unscented Kalman Filter and another estimation algorithm, such as the Unscented Particle Filter (UPF) through simulation for our system.",

First, the existence of a limit cycle mode due to the limited sensor resolution in the systems with P-controller is shown in analogy to [1]. Because of the poor transient response of the P-controlled system the extension to the PD-controller is thereafter taken into consideration. A simple solution for limit cycles avoidance in terms of modification of controller structure is provided. The experimental data confirm the theoretical analysis for the robotics actuators.",

        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "In this paper describes a pair of wall climbing robots that use magnetic wheels for adhesion. They are designed for inspecting the interior surfaces of gas-tanks in oversea ships. Environments like this were impossible to access by previous climbing robots, as they are made out of very thin sheet metal that cannot support a high robot mass and contain several types of difficult obstacles. In order to master these challenges, the system described in this work uses two robots in a \"mother-child\"-structure: the smaller robot is built very lightweight and simple, without the ability to steer or climb vertically. It just moves horizontally and uses ridges in the gas tank surface as guidance rails. In order to pass from one ridge to the next one, the smaller robot docks to the bigger \"mother\"-robot. This robot always stays in an area where the sheet metal is thicker and never enters the extremely fragile surfaces. Thus, its mass is not critical for the structural stability of the environment and the robot can hence be built big enough to be able to climb in all directions of gravity and to pass difficult obstacles along its path. In the present paper, the basic concept, the mechanical design of all important components and the proposed control strategy are described briefly, followed by test results of the most critical components. An outlook to similar applications to which the basic idea of this work can be successfully transferred concludes this article.",

Balance is achieved by integral control, which decouples the dynamics and produces smooth torque signals. Simulation shows the controller performs better than other simple balance controllers. Because the controller is inspired by human balance strategies, we compare human motion capture and force plate data to simulation. A model tracking controller is also presented, making it possible to control complex robots using this simple control.",

In this paper we present the robot head MEXI which is able to recognize emotions of its human counterpart from a video sequence using a fuzzy rule based approach. It reacts on these perceptions in an emotional way. Therefor MEXI maintains an internal state made up of (artificial) emotions and drives. This internal state is used to evaluate its perceptions and action alternatives and controls its behavior on the basis of this evaluation. This is a major difference between MEXI and usual goal based agents that rely on a world model to control and plan their actions. For MEXI the behavior based programming paradigm originally developed by Arkin for robot navigation was extended to support a multidimensional control architecture based on emotions and drives.",

In some cases, 80% or more of the total information can be described with only two scalar component values. Robotic hands, however, commonly only couple intra-finger joints, and rarely take advantage of this inter-finger coordination. In this paper, real-world data on a variety of human hand postures was collected using a data glove, and principal components analysis was used to calculate these synergies, resulting in what we call eigenpostures. A novel mechanism design is presented to combine the eigenpostures and drive a 17-degree-of-freedom 5-fingered robot hand. The hand uses only 2 DC motors to accurately recreate a wide range of hand shapes. We also present a design improvement that allows us to distinguish between high-precision and low-precision tasks, as well as greatly reduce overall error.",

We conducted an experiment to study the effect of a human presence behind an interactive humanoid robot. We used an interactive robot system based on a motion-capturing system where participants can bodily interact with the robot. They were deceptively informed that they would either be interacting with a robot controlled by a program or a human; in fact, in both conditions the robot was autonomous. Experimental results indicated that two-thirds of the participants felt that they were interacting with the robot itself. Their enjoyment was unaffected by the knowledge of whether the robot was controlled by a program or a human, although their impression of robot intelligence indicated that they distinguished between these conditions. On the contrary, since the remaining one-third of the participants felt they were interacting with a human behind the robot, they were affected by the knowledge: when they were told they were interacting with a teleoperated robot, they enjoyed it less; in contrast, their enjoyment increased when they were told they were interacting with an autonomous robot.",

Walk-Mate generates a model walking rhythm in response to a user\u2019s locomotion in real time, and by indicating this rhythm using auditory stimuli, provides a technology that supports walking by reducing asymmetries and fluctuations in foot contact rhythm. From the results, Walk-Mate effectively compensated for locomotion problems of hemiparetic patients by improving gait rhythm both during and after training, suggesting that locomotive function was effectively recovered The interactive mechanism of Walk-Mate may be capable of simultaneously achieving the aims of gait compensation and gait rehabilitation training methods previously developed under individual frameworks. Walk-Mate is a promising technology for assisting the reintegration of disabled persons into society.",

The proto symbols abstract motion patterns, while the words are associated with the proto symbols stochastically. This paper describes the construction of a word space, where words are located in a multidimensional space based on dissimilarities among the words. The dissimilarity between two words can be calculated by using association probabilities that the words generate motion proto symbols. The word space encapsulates relations among the words such as similar or dissimilar pairs of words. The word space also allows motion recognition based on words. The validity of the constructed word space is demonstrated on a motion capture database. Moreover, the addition of the word associations is found to change the conventional proto symbol space so that the discrimination among the proto symbols is improved.",

        "abstract": "The motion of the lower limbs in bipedal walking is characterized by a foot-rolling motion, including heel-strike and toe-off. In this paper, the dynamical influence of this motion on walking stability is examined using a simple walking model driven by a rhythmic signal from an internal oscillator. In order to model the rolling motion, a circular arc is attached to the tip of the legs. In particular, we obtained approximate periodic solutions and analyzed the dependence of the local stability on the circular arc radius using a Poincare map, which revealed that the circular arc radius is optimal when it is similar in size to the leg length, to maximize the stable region for such characteristic parameters as mass ratio and walking speed. On the other hand, it is also found that a circular arc radius of zero maximizes the rate of convergence to the stable walking motion. These conflicting results imply that the optimal radius of a circular arc with respect to local stability exists from a trade-off between these different criteria, which should be considered in designing a biped robot.",

Our system repeats the steps: (1) autonomous exploration (2) recording of news, and (3) generation of articles. We characterize events with two values: \"anomaly\" and \"relevance\" to the user. During the exploration step, images are evaluated using these values. If an interesting event is detected, the robot approaches it to collect additional information. The system then labels the images, and generates a description from the labels. Experiments show the ability of our system to find news-like phenomena and describe images with words.",

        "abstract": "Traditionally, visual servoing is separated into tracking and control subsystems. This separation, though convenient, is not necessarily well justified. When tracking and control strategies are designed independently, it is not clear how to optimize them to achieve a certain task. In this work, we propose a framework in which spatial sampling kernels - borrowed from the tracking and registration literature - are used to design feedback controllers for visual servoing. The use of spatial sampling kernels provides natural hooks for Lyapunov theory, thus unifying tracking and control and providing a framework for optimizing a particular servoing task. As a first step, we develop kernel-based visual servos for a subset of relative motions between camera and target scene. The subset of motions we consider are 2D translation, scale, and roll of the target relative to the camera. Our approach provides formal guarantees on the convergence/stability of visual servoing algorithms under putatively generic conditions.",

To date, nearly all designs and analyses of omnidirectional robots have considered the case of motion on flat, smooth terrain. This paper presents a kinematic analysis and control method for an omnidirectional mobile robot driven by active split offset casters operating on rough, uneven terrain. Robot average isotropy is analyzed as a function of wheel module geometry on both flat and rough terrain. A simple kinematic control scheme that considers the effects of terrain unevenness is presented. The performance of the algorithm in rough terrain is studied in simulation. It is shown that with knowledge of terrain conditions, near- omnidirectional mobility is achievable in rough terrain.",

The limited maneuverability of currently available catheters necessitates a control system by which the catheter is moved inside the heart with more precision. To realize such a system, the first step is to model the catheter's movements in real-time. In this paper, a simplified approach is proposed to kinematically characterize a general single-segment active catheter. In this approach, the distal shaft of the flexible catheter is modeled as a rigid manipulator with coupled joints. To demonstrate the validity of the new model, experiments are conducted by using an existing steerable ablation catheter.",

Kinematics modeling for a tracked mobile manipulator is an intractable problem, because there are infinite number of contact points between the tracks and the terrain which makes slippage unavoidable. The track-terrain and vehicle-manipulator interactions make the problem even more complex and difficult to solve since the motion of the onboard manipulator and the centrifugal forces during moderate or high speed motion will give rise to transfer of the load distribution, which may affect the longitudinal and lateral tractive forces and the resistance. This work aims at developing a general kinematics modeling approach, which lays a solid foundation for automatic control of tracked mobile manipulators.",

In the query phase, it plans a time-optimal path on the roadmap that obeys the dynamic constraints (bounded acceleration, curvature derivative) on the robot and avoids collisions with any of the moving obstacles. We do not put any constraints on the motions of the moving obstacles, but we assume that they are completely known when a query is performed.

        "abstract": "Distributed coordination is critical for a multi-robot system in hazardous waste cleanup under a dynamic environment. To achieve higher efficiency as well as robustness, a bio-inspired local interaction via virtual stigmergy (LIVS) coordination approach is proposed in this paper. This new meta-heuristic integrates two mechanisms - stigmergy-based autocatalytic mechanism and particle swarm optimization cognitive capabilities through local interaction - into one efficient approach. The proposed LIVS algorithm has been implemented on both self-developed simulator and embodied robot simulator Player/Stage in a searching task. The simulation results demonstrate the feasibility, robustness, and scalability of the methods with real-world constraints.",

        "abstract": "Standard methods to model multibody systems are aimed at systems with configuration spaces isomorphic to R\". This limitation leads to singularities and other artifacts in case the configuration space has a different topology, for example in the case of ball joints or a free-floating mechanism. This paper discusses an extension of classical methods to allow for a very general class of joints, including all joints with a Lie group structure as well as nonholonomic joints. The model equations are derived using the Boltzmann-Hamel equations and have very similar structure and complexity as obtained using classical methods, but they do not suffer from singularities. Furthermore, the equations are explicit differential equations (both for holonomic and nonholonomic joints) and can be directly implemented in simulation software.",

A parametric human shape model is recursively updated to fit observed data after each resampling step of the particle filter.

This method has been implemented and tested by using a network of laser range finders to observe human subjects in a variety of interactions. We present results illustrating that our method can closely track torso and arm movements even with noisy and incomplete sensor data, and we show examples of body language primitives that can be observed from this orientation and positioning information.",

        "abstract": "In an effort to ease the burden of programming motor commands for humanoid robots, a computer vision technique is developed for converting a monocular video sequence of human poses into stabilized robot motor commands for a humanoid robot. The human teacher wears a multi-colored body suit while performing a desired set of actions. Leveraging the colors of the body suit, the system detects the most probable locations of the different body parts and joints in the image. Then, by exploiting the known dimensions of the body suit, a user specified number of candidate 3D poses are generated for each frame. Using human to robot joint correspondences, the estimated 3D poses for each frame are then mapped to corresponding robot motor commands. An initial set of kinematically valid motor commands is generated using an approximate best path search through the pose candidates for each frame. Finally a learning-based probabilistic dynamic balance model obtains a dynamically stable imitative sequence of motor commands. We demonstrate the viability of the approach by presenting results showing full-body imitation of human actions by a Fujitsu HOAP-2 humanoid robot.",

        "abstract": "A central challenging problem in humanoid robotics is to plan and execute dynamic tasks in dynamic environments. Given that the environment is known, sampling-based online motion planners are best suited for handling changing environments. However, without learning strategies, each task still has to be planned from scratch, preventing these algorithms from getting closer to realtime performance. This paper proposes a novel learning-based motion planning algorithm for addressing this issue. Our algorithm, called the Attractor Guided Planner (AGP), extends existing motion planners in two simple but important ways. First, it extracts significant attractor points from successful paths in order to reuse them as guiding landmarks during the planning of new similar tasks. Second, it relies on a task comparison metric for deciding when previous solutions should be reused for guiding the planning of new tasks. The task comparison metric takes into account the task specification and as well environment features which are relevant to the query. Several experiments are presented with different humanoid reaching examples in the presence of randomly moving obstacles. Our results show that the AGP greatly improves both the planning time and solution quality, when comparing to traditional sampling-based motion planners.",

Feature correspondences are estimated using a variant of the PROSAC algorithm. Our mapping technique constructs a graph of spatial constraints and applies an efficient gradient descent-based optimization approach to estimate the most likely map of the environment.

Based on the idea that the human brain represents objects as volumetric primitives in order to recognize them, the presented algorithm predicts grasp as a function of the object's parts assembly. Beginning with a complete 3D model of the object, a segmentation step decomposes it into single parts. Each single part is fitted with a simple geometric model. A learning step is finally needed in order to find the object component that humans choose to grasp it.",

In oversubscribed domains all tasks cannot be completed within the required deadlines due to a lack of resources. We focus specifically on domains where tasks can be generated throughout the mission, tasks can have different levels of importance and urgency, and penalties are assessed for failed commitments. Therefore, agents must reason about potential future events before making task commitments. Within these constraints, existing market-based approaches to task allocation can handle task importance and urgency, but do a poor job of anticipating future tasks, and are hence assessed a high number of penalties. In this work, we enhance a baseline market-based task allocation approach using regression-based learning to reduce overall incurred penalties. We illustrate the effectiveness of our approach in a simulated disaster response scenario by comparing performance with a baseline market-approach.",

Inspiration from biological systems coupled with revolutionary breakthroughs in microfabrication technologies have now enabled the realization of insect- sized micro air vehicles (MAVs). This work describes a solution to the mechanical and aeromechanical components of an insect-scale MAV by demonstrating a 60 mg structure that can generate sufficient lift to takeoff with external power and constrained body degrees of freedom.",

However, in many situations, it is not feasible or easy to obtain an accurate analytic model of the robot's dynamics. An alternative to analytically deriving the dynamics is learning the dynamics from movement data. This paper describes a load estimation technique that uses the learned instead of analytically derived dynamics. We study examples where the various inertial parameters of the load are estimated from the learned models, their effectiveness in control is evaluated along with their robustness in light of imperfect, intermediate dynamic models.",

        "abstract": "An approach to stereo based local path planning in unstructured environments is presented. The approach differs from previous stereo based and image based planning systems (e.g. top-down occupancy grid planners, autonomous highway driving algorithms, and view-sequenced route representation), in that it uses specialized cost functions to find paths through an occupancy grid representation of the world directly in the image plane and forgoes a projection of cost information from the image plane down onto a top-down 2D Cartesian cost map. We discuss three cost metrics for path selection in image space. We present a basic image based planning system, discuss its susceptibility to rotational and translational oscillation, and present and implement two extensions to the basic system that overcome these limitations - a cylindrical based image system and a hierarchical planning system. All three systems are implemented in an autonomous robot and are tested against a standard top-down 2D Cartesian planning system on three outdoor courses of varying difficulty. We find that the basic image based planning system fails under certain conditions; however, the cylindrical based system is well suited to the task of local path planning and for use as a high resolution local planning component of a hierarchical planning system.",

In addition to finding its way through known, fixed obstacle configurations, the planning system can reason about the future state of the world to locomote through challenging environments when the obstacle motions can be inferred from observation. This video presents work using a vision system to predict the velocities of objects in the scene, allowing ASIMO to safely navigate autonomously through a dynamic environment. Neither obstacle positions nor velocities are known at the start of the trial, but are estimated online as the robot walks. The planner constantly adjusts the footstep path with the latest estimates of ASIMO\u2019s position and the obstacle trajectories, allowing the robot to successfully circumnavigate the moving obstacles.",

The navigation task requires identifying safe, traversable paths which allow the robot to progress toward a goal while avoiding obstacles. One approach is to apply Machine Learning techniques that accomplish near to far learning by augmenting near-field Stereo to identify safe terrain and obstacles in the far field. Some mechanism for applying past learned experience to the active navigation task is crucial for effective far-field classification. We introduce a new method for long-term learning in the robot navigation task by selecting a subset of previously learned linear binary classifiers. We then combine their output to produce a final classification for a new image. Techniques for efficient selection of models, as well as the combination of their output, are addressed. We evaluate the performance of our technique on three fully labeled datasets, and show that our technique outperforms several baseline techniques that do not leverage past experience.",

We aimed in this study to compute the needed patterns stimulation necessary to perform a desired given motion of the knee joint. We coupled the exact input output feedback linearization with a model predictive controller (MPC). This latter enables us to incorporate explicitly constraints on inputs, outputs and system states.

For assembly of small parts which are components of electronic devices, we need two key technologies: accurate position control and force control in handling them. In this paper, we utilize a four-degree-of-freedom assembly robot with a camera for position control. This vision-based assembly system gives us positioning accuracy of micrometer order. We also control the pressing load of the robot in pick-and-place of small objects indirectly with mechanical springs and a displacement sensor by changing resilience force of springs actively. We execute some experiments to handle small electronic parts using above-mentioned active force control and vision-based position control.",

        "abstract": "The distance between robots and users increasingly shrinks and with it the potential for robots to inadvertently harm users increasingly grows. Robots need to detect ongoing haptic interaction with users via malleable skin with flexible tactile sensors covering the whole body surface in order to reduce the risk and to realize enriched interactions. In this paper, we propose a feature space based on cross-correlation between tactile sensors, and we visualized it as a 2-dimensional map which we call Somatosensory Map. We construct a haptic interaction database using scenario based haptic interaction between humans and a robot that we equipped with distributed tactile sensors covering the whole body. In the Somatosensory Map, highly correlated sensors make clusters corresponding to distinctive haptic interactions between the robot and the subject. Each haptic interaction can thus be classified using cross-correlation between tactile sensors. To confirm the validity of our proposal, we apply the K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN) method using the feature space. As a validation test result, despite KNN being one of the simplest methods, over 60% of haptic interaction in which we may expect subject\u2019s touches can be recognized. In conclusion, the cross-correlation includes good features to classify the interaction. As future work, the classifier should be improved to use effective cross-correlation shown as distribution of distinctive clusters in the Somatosensory Map.",

We discuss the characteristics of such a tracking system, mainly concentrating on a system that uses laser range finders as both mobile and static sensors. Estimation methods based on Kalman Filter and Covariance Intersection are presented and analyzed. Finally, the presented methods are experimentally tested.",

        "abstract": "In the recent years, there has been considerable interest in developing active catheters instrumented with shape memory alloy (SMA) actuators to perform angioplasty. The problem, however, with SMA actuators is the extremely non-linear response of the strain with input current. Therefore, control of such an active catheter inside the body is inaccurate and which could lead to unforeseen damage. In this paper, a novel model for SMAs and a robust Hinfin loop-shaping controller has been implemented to guarantee robust performance of the active catheter. A closed-loop control algorithm has been implemented to precisely orient the catheter in space based on feedback from a 5-DOF magnetic sensor. The active catheter tracks a reference trajectory generated either by a haptic device under the control of a user or from an image processing algorithm which determines the angle of a branch in the vasculature.",

The proposed model extends a passive fingertip force model by considering the mobility of the fingertip in terms of its deformation. The model selects the smaller force of the following two forces: the maximum force calculated using the musculoskeletal model and the maximum force calculated using the maximum deformation depth of the fingertip that lies within the ranges of motion of all the joints. A further extension of the previous passive fingertip force model is that a nonlinear relationship between muscle length and exerted force is considered. Maximum active fingertip forces were measured for three subjects and compared with the forces calculated using the proposed model and the previous model. The results of our model were in good agreement with the measured forces in contrast with the large values obtained using the passive fingertip force model.",

        "abstract": "We performed in situ measurements of mechanical properties of individual W303 wild-type yeast cells by using an integrated environmental scanning electron microscope (ESEM) - nanomanipulator system. Compression experiments to penetrate a cell wall of an individual cell under two difference conditions, i.e. ESEM (600 Pa) and high vacuum (HV) (about 3 mPa) modes have been conducted. Data from the experiments clearly show a significant increase of about twenty five times of penetration force values from ESEM mode to HV mode; i.e. 152 nN and 4 muN for 5 mum cell size with sharp tip indenter. This can be further confirmed from quantitative estimation of average cell rigidity through the Hertz model, i.e. ESEM mode (2.16 plusmn 1.21 MPa) and HV (20.58 plusmn 2.09 MPa) for all cell sizes with sharp tip indenter. Further analysis also revealed that the size of the cells can influence its mechanical strength. As the size of the cell increases, the compression force needed to penetrate its wall also increases. From these experimental results, we can conclude that the force needed to penetrate a single cell does not only depend on the internal factor, i.e. cell size but also being influenced by the external factors, i.e. the environmental conditions.",

Meld is a declarative language, based on P2, a logicprogramming language originally designed for programming overlay networks. By using logic programming, the code for an ensemble of robots can be written from a global perspective, as opposed to a large collection of independent robot views. This greatly simplifies the thought process needed for programming large ensembles. Initial experience shows that this also leads to a considerable reduction in code size and complexity. An initial implementation of Meld has been completed and has been used to demonstrate its effectiveness in the Claytronics simulator. Early results indicate that Meld programs are considerably more concise (more than 20\u00d7 shorter) than programs written in C++, while running nearly as efficiently.",

        "track": "main",
        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "Any system that has the capability to diagnose and recover from faults is considered to be a fault-tolerant system. Additionally, the quality of the incorporated fault-tolerance has a direct impact on the overall performance of the system. Hence, being able to measure the extent and usefulness of fault- tolerance exhibited by the system would provide the designer with a useful analysis tool for better understanding the system as a whole. Unfortunately, it is difficult to quantify system fault-tolerance on its own for intelligent systems. A more useful metric for evaluation is the \"effectiveness\" measure of fault- tolerance. The influence of fault-tolerance towards improving overall performance determines the overall effectiveness or quality of the system. In this paper, we outline application- independent metrics to measure fault-tolerance within the context of system performance. In addition, we also outline potential methods to better interpret the obtained measures towards understanding the capabilities of the implemented system. Furthermore, a main focus of our approach is to capture the effect of intelligence, reasoning, or learning on the effective fault-tolerance of the system, rather than relying purely on traditional redundancy based measures. We show the utility of the designed metrics by applying them to different fault-tolerance architectures implemented for multiple complex heterogeneous multi-robot team applications and comparing system performance. Finally, we contrast the developed metrics with the only other existing method (HWB method) for evaluating (that we are aware of) effective fault-tolerance for multi-robot teams and rate them in terms of their capability to best interpret the workings of the implemented systems. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first metric that attempts to evaluate the quality of learning towards understanding system level fault-tolerance.",

With a single drive motor, the legs of the robot press the feet against the glass, then gradually peel them away, mimicking the foot motions observed in insects. With feet made of scotch tape, the robot was able to walk on glass walls and ceilings and transition between surfaces intersecting at interior angles. This paper demonstrates that using passively compliant feet on simple rotating wheel-legs a robot can apply adhesive feet, spines, and Velcro in order to climb various steep substrates.",

        "abstract": "This paper presents experimental results on the localization of a mobile robot equipped with relative frequent and absolute infrequent sensors. The relative sensors used are two: a wheel based odometry and a visual based odometry. The absolute sensor is a vision based landmark detector that computes the pose of the robot relative to a pre-mapped visual beacon. This would be a simple sensor fusion problem, which could be solved using standard recursive estimators, if we would not have considered two extra characteristics of the beacon detector: (1) since we assume a monocular vision system and a planar visual mark, the localization problem presents up to four possible solutions; and (2) the frequency that the robot meets a visual mark is very low (0.01 Hz or less). To consider these characteristics, we propose the use of a particle filter with a very precise prediction step (obtained by combining the two odometry sensors available) and a correction step that considers the multi-modal characteristic of the data. Besides, the sensor fusion algorithm, the paper also describes the development of the visual sensors used in the localization process.",

        "abstract": "This article presents an adaptive dynamic clustered particle filtering method for mobile robot global localization. The posterior distribution of robot pose in global localization is usually multimodal due to the symmetry of the environment and ambiguous detected features. Moreover, the multimodal distribution of the posterior varies as the robot moves and observations are obtained. Considering these characteristics, we use a set of clusters of particles to represent the posterior. These clusters are dynamically evolved corresponding to the varying posterior by merging the overlapping clusters and splitting the diffuse clusters or those whose particles gather to some sub-clusters inside. Further, in order to improve computational efficiency without sacrificing estimation accuracy, a mechanism for adapting the sample size of clusters is proposed. The theoretical lower bound of the number of particles needed to limit the estimation error is derived, based on the central limit theorem in multidimensional space and the statistic theory of ImportanceSampling (IS). Simulation results show the effectiveness of the proposed method, which is sufficient to achieve robust tracking of robot\u2019s real pose and meanwhile significantly enhance the computational efficiency.",

Because of this complexity, as well as of wear and aging of components, faults occurs in such systems quite frequently at runtime. In order to use such drives in truly autonomous robots it is desirable that the robot is able to automatically react to such faults. Therefore, the robot needs reasoning and reconfiguration capabilities in order to be able to detect, localize and repair such faults on-line. In this paper we propose a model-based diagnosis and reconfiguration framework which allows an autonomous robot to detect and compensate faults in its drive. Moreover, we present an implementation for a real robot platform. Finally, we report experimental results which shows that the proposed framework is able to correctly cope with injected faults in the drive hardware, like broken motors.",

A two-dimensional model is built that mimics the apparent perspective deformations of the three- dimensional handle. The model is fitted to the handle using efficient algorithms, that include M-estimators for improved robustness.

We propose a method which is easily expandable its handle able furniture such as closet, shelf and so on. If the robot can handle such furniture autonomously, it is expected that multiple daily tasks, for example, storing a small object in a drawer, can be achieved by the robot. Because perplexing processes is needed to give the knowledge of furniture handling to the robot manually, we propose direct teaching based approach which can easily give not only how to handle the furniture but also an appearance and 3D shape of it. Combining general knowledge given in advance and manipulation procedure instructed by human directly, the robot acquires how to manipulate the storing places. The performance of the proposed method is illustrated by experiments.",

        "track": "main",
        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "This paper is concerned with modeling and prediction of lung tumor motion for a new adaptive tumor tracking system in radiotherapy. Information of the tumor motion is used to control a robotic treatment couch, which moves in six degrees of freedom and maintains the tumor in a certain fixed spatial position. With this new technology it is possible to avoid gating during the radiotherapy as well as active breathing control, such that duration and cost of the therapy as well as trauma of the patient can be reduced. The tumor position is detected by an electronic portal imaging device (EPID) such that internal markers for the tumor tracking are no longer necessary. An infrared (IR) camera is introduced to detect abdominal motion, which provides a reference to the respiratory signal and can be used to predict the tumor position over a complete breathing period. This paper presents the effort of tumor motion modeling and prediction. Main challenges with the proposed method in this context are: lack of breathing control causes irregular respiration, low data rate of the EPID device delivers too few information about the tumor position. Two methods, namely an adaptive filtering and a nonlinear method based on Takens Theorem, have been investigated and compared with respect to diverse criteria including prediction accuracy, model complexity and computational effort. Performance analysis with clinical data has shown that both methods can well describe correlation between the EPID and the IR signals, while the adaptive filter possesses advantage with respect of computational effort.",

        "abstract": "Contact and deformation modeling for interactive environments has seen many applications, from surgical simulation and training, to virtual prototyping, to teleoperation, etc., where both visual feedback and haptic feedback are needed in real-time (kHz). In this paper, we consider contacts between a rigid body and an elastic object and address a little studied problem: the modeling and rendering of compliant twisting or rotation of the rigid body on the surface of the elastic object and the associated effects in the deformation of the elastic object. We present a unique strategy to model the contact torques applied to the rigid body and the resulted shape deformation of the elastic object. This strategy extends the general paradigm of contact and deformable modeling introduced by the authors earlier [1] so that not only contact forces but also contact torques, not only compliant translations but also compliant rotations of the rigid body, as well as the resulted deformations of the elastic object can all be simulated in a combined update rate of over lfeHz. The strategy is implemented, and the experimental results confirm its effectiveness and efficiency.",

        "abstract": "We present a novel framework for learning crosssensory and sensorimotor correlations in order to detect and localize faults in mobile robots. Unlike traditional fault detection and identification schemes, we do not use a priori models of fault states or system dynamics. Instead, we utilize additional information and possible source of redundancy that mobile robots have available to them, namely a hierarchical graph representing stages of sensory processing at multiple levels of abstractions and their outputs. We learn statistical models of correlations between elements in the hierarchy, in addition to the control signals, and use this to detect and identify changes in the capabilities of the robot. The framework is instantiated using Self-Organizing Maps, a simple unsupervised learning algorithm. Results indicate that the system can detect sensory and motor faults in a mobile robot and identify their cause, without using a priori models of the robot or its fault states.",

This linear model will be essential for the future control of the system, in order to achieve force measurement without displacement of the platform. The determination of the platform position and orientation in the horizontal plane is done thanks to three laser range sensors. Sensors configuration provide a linear transformation between the three measured ranges and the position and orientation of the platform. Finally, an open loop result comparison is done between the linear state model and a more complex 3D non linear model.",

The equations of motion for the VTOL aircraft are obtained using Euler-Lagrange approach. Due to the configuration of the aircraft the attitude dynamics are practically independent of the translational dynamics corresponding to the lateral displacements (x and y). A nonlinear control strategy based in the Lyapunov analysis is proposed to stabilize this aircraft at hover. The performance of the nonlinear control algorithm is illustrated with real-time experiments.",

        "abstract": "This paper introduces Petri net based models of robotic tasks, which can be used to analyse and synthesise task plans, taking into account a Petri net model that abstracts the relevant features from the robot environment as well. Logical analysis concerning deadlocks and resource conservation can be performed over the ordinary version of the model. A task plan modeled by a Petri net can be extracted from the generalised stochastic version of the model, representing the optimal plan given a probabilistic measure of uncertainty associated to the effects of its composing actions. The Petri net representing the model is suitable for being ran directly within the code, as well as for plan monitoring during execution time. Simulation results illustrating the methodology are presented for a robotic soccer scenario.",

        "abstract": "Complex navigational commands require a walk ing pattern generator that is able to modify the pattern at any point in the walking gait. This paper utilizes the 3D-LIPM(Linear Inverted Pendulum Model) for generating a walking pattern, but introduces a method that allows for manipulation of the ZMP over the convex hull of the foot polygon whilst in single support phase. This permits a range of dynamic walking states that are not achievable using the conventional 3D-LIPM. These walking states are defined as a feasible region. A real-time algorithm is then developed, which follows the cue from a complex navigational command exactly when the desired walking state is in the feasible region and chooses the nearest feasible motion when it lies outside the feasible region. The proposed scheme is both simulated and implemented on the humanoid robot HanSaRam-VII developed at RIT laboratory, KAIST.",

        "abstract": "Two feedback controllers that induce stable running gaits on a three-degree-of-freedom asymmetric hopper, termed the asymmetric spring loaded inverted pendulum (ASLIP), see Fig. 1, are compared in terms of their steady-state and transient behaviors. In each case, feedback is used to create a lower-dimensional hybrid subsystem that determines the existence and stability properties of periodic motions of the full-dimensional closed-loop system. The first controller creates a one degree-of-freedom subsystem through imposing two suitably selected (virtual) holonomic constraints on the configuration variables of the ASLIP. The second controller asymptotically imposes a single (virtual) holonomic constraint to create a two-degree-of-freedom subsystem that is diffeomorphic to a standard spring loaded inverted pendulum (SLIP). The two controllers induce identical steady-state behaviors. Under transient conditions, however, the underlying compliant nature of the SLIP allows significantly larger disturbances to be accommodated, with less actuator effort, and without violation of the unilateral constraints between the leg end and the ground.",

The mimesis model is extended to include motion understanding from monocular image sequences and to imitate whole-body motion patterns in 3D space. In order to achieve this goal, (1) conversion of 3D motion database, represented in probabilistic form, into various spaces is adopted. (2) A vector field approach is developed for natural motion understanding. (3) With the particle filter, a demonstrator\u2019s pose is estimated.",

The channel is then used to build safe and short paths within from Start to Goal. It is also possible to weight certain passageways of the space so that the robot can avoid costly routes, which is especially useful for traffic control applications. Finally, a tracking control strategy along trajectory based on preplanned path is applied for a synchronous drive robot. The algorithm is simple, complete, and does not suffer from local minima. It is also extendable to 3 and higher C-spaces.",

Then, we plan the collision free motion for the period of time causing the collision. In our motion planner, we can consider the constraint condition which are the functions of time. Also, for keeping balance of the robot, we plan the motion with keeping the horizontal position of the COG as well as the position/orientation of the feet/hand.

        "abstract": "Because of the complexity of the mechanisms of redundantly actuated omni-directional Wheeled Mobile Robots (WMR), its motion regulation is a challenging problem, especially for consideration of the interaction force between the redundantly actuated wheels. The interaction force can be decomposed into motion-induced force and internal force, which are orthogonal between each other. Only the motion-induced force contributes to the motion of the robot, while the internal force abrades the wheels components, and causes the reduction of their life span. So the internal force should be eliminated or minimized. In this paper, kinematic model and dynamic model of redundantly actuated omni-directional WMR considering the interaction force is first established. A proportional differential plus motion regulator is presented. An integral feedback internal force controller is applied to minimize the internal force. Simulation results verify the effectiveness of the proposed control scheme. The robot is regulated successfully, and the internal force is reduced efficiently.",

        "abstract": "While underactuated robotic systems are capable of energy efficient and rapid dynamic behavior, we still do not fully understand how body dynamics can be actively used for adaptive behavior in complex unstructured environment. In particular, we can expect that the robotic systems could achieve high maneuverability by flexibly storing and releasing energy through the motor control of the physical interaction between the body and the environment. This paper presents a minimalistic optimization strategy of motor control policy for underactuated legged robotic systems. Based on a reinforcement learning algorithm, we propose an optimization scheme, with which the robot can exploit passive elasticity for hopping forward while maintaining the stability of locomotion process in the environment with a series of large changes of ground surface. We show a case study of a simple one-legged robot which consists of a servomotor and a passive elastic joint. The dynamics and learning performance of the robot model are tested in simulation, and then transferred the results to the real-world robot.",

        "abstract": "A problem of searching with multiple searchers and scouts is presented. Unlike most search problems that terminate as soon as the target is found, successful detection by scouts only improve on the current knowledge of the moving target's location, such that the searchers can more effectively find and service the target in the future. The team must correspondingly plan not only to maximize the probability of the searchers directly finding the target, but also give them the best chance of exploiting any new information from potential scout detections. It is shown that this need to plan for replanning can be addressed by equivalently solving a series of simpler detection search problems that always do terminate on detection. Optimal and heuristic solution methods for this searcher/scout problem are derived, such that the capabilities of all the sensing platforms in a search task are harnessed even when only a subset are capable of actually servicing the target.",

        "track": "main",
        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "This paper proposes a switched visual feedback control method for a micro helicopter under occlusions. Two stationary cameras are placed on the ground. They track four black balls attached to rods connected to the bottom of the helicopter. The control input is computed by using the errors between the positions of the tracked objects and pre-specifled reference values for them. The multi-camera configuration is redundant for helicopter control, but it enables us to design a switched controller which is robust against occlusions. An occlusion occurs when an object moves across in front of a camera or when the background color happens to be similar to the color of a tracked object. Multi-camera systems are suitable for designing a robust controller under occlusions, since even when a tracked object is not visible in a camera view, other cameras may track it. The authors have proposed a camera selection approach: If an occlusion is detected in a camera view then the other camera is used to control the helicopter. This paper presents another switched visual feedback control method for a micro helicopter under occlusions. This is called the image feature selection approach. This paper assumes that at most one tracked object is occluded at each time to simplify notations, although we can draw general conclusions. The errors between the positions of the tracked objects and pre-specifled references are used to compute the control input, when all the tracked objects are visible. If one of the tracked objects is invisible, then the controller uses the errors given by the other three tracked objects. The position of the occluded object is also estimated by using the other three tracked objects.",

Humanoid robot system for real world service application must integrate an object recognition subsystem and a motion planning subsystem in both mobility and manipulation tasks. These requirements involve the vision system capable of self-localization for navigation tasks and object recognition for manipulation tasks, while communicating with the motion planning subsystem. In this paper, we describe a design and implementation of knowledge based visual 3D object recognition system with multi-cue integration using particle filter technique. The particle filter provides very robust object recognition performance and knowledge based approach enables robot to perform both object localization and self localization with movable/fixed information. Since this object recognition subsystem share knowledge with a motion planning subsystem, we are able to generate vision-guided humanoid behaviors without considering visual processing functions. Finally, in order to demonstrate the generality of the system, we demonstrated several vision-based humanoid behavior experiments in a daily life environment.",

        "abstract": "In recent years, the success of single-robot SLAM has led to more multi-robot SLAM (MR-SLAM) research. A team of robots with MR-SLAM can explore an environment more efficiently and reliably; however, MR-SLAM also raises many challenging problems, including map fusion, unknown robot poses and scalability issues. The first two problems can be considered as an optimization problem of finding a consistent joint map based on robots\u2019 relative poses and sensory data. This optimization problem exhibits a similar property of a singlerobot topological/metric mapping. To exploit this property, we propose a multi-robot SLAM (MR-SLAM) algorithm, which builds a graph-like topological map with vertices representing local metric maps and edges describing relative positions of adjacent local maps. In this MR-SLAM algorithm, the map fusion between two robots can be naturally done by adding an edge that connects two topological maps, and the estimation of relative robot pose is simply performed by optimizing this edge. For the third scalable problem, the proposed algorithm is also scalable to the number of robots and the size of an environment. Computer simulations with a public data set and experimental work on Pioneer 3-DX robots have been conducted to validate the performance of the proposed MR-SLAM algorithm.",

        "abstract": "This paper presents a new branch-and-bound (B&B) method to reduce the computational burden of online optimization in multi-vehicle formation control with collision avoidance that is formulated by model predictive control. One of the possible reasons for extremely heavy computation time of the standard B&B algorithm is that so many subproblems are generated since integer constraints are rarely satisfied in \u201crelaxed\u201d problems. The purpose of the proposed method is to decrease subproblems based on a new branching rule taking into account the inherent properties of collision avoidance problems. Numerical examples and experiments show that the proposed method drastically reduces computation time of online optimization for multi-vehicle formation control.",

        "abstract": "Superbot consists of Lego-like but autonomous robotic modules that can reconfigure into different systems for different tasks. Examples of configurable systems include rolling tracks or wheels (for efficient travel), spiders or centipedes (for climbing), snakes (for burrowing in ground), and climbers (for inspection and repair in space). This video shows several configurations and behaviors that are new for modular and reconfigurable robots. Each SuperBot module is a complete robotic system and has a power supply, micro- controllers, sensors, communication, three degrees of freedom, and six connecting faces (front, back, left, right, up and down) to dynamically connect to other modules. This design allows flexible bending, docking, and continuous rotation. A single module can move forward, back, left, right, flip-over, and rotate as a wheel. Modules can communication with each other for totally distributed control and can support arbitrary module reshuffling during their operation. The modules have both internal and external sensors for monitoring self-status and environmental parameters. They can form arbitrary configurations (graphs) and can control these configurations for different functionality such as locomotion, manipulation, and self-repair. This video shows the latest status the SuperBot modules and all these behaviors were made in just one week. The fact that SuperBot can achieve so much in so short a time demonstrates the unique value of modular, multifunctional and self-reconfigurable robots.",

We apply a musical information analysis method in segmenting the motion sequence relevant to the key poses and the musical rhythm. We define a task model considering the repeated motion segments, where the motion is decomposed into person invariant factor task and person dependant factor style. We capture the motion data of different people for a few cycles, segment it using the musical analysis approach, normalize the segments using a vectorization method, and realize our MFT model. The experiments are conducted according to two approaches. Various experiments that we conduct to evaluate the potential of the recognition ability of our proposed approaches and the results demonstrate the high accuracy of our model. The recognition results and the motion decomposition will be used in further extending the motion generation process in various styles and for different tasks.",

The robot uses its physical embodiment to grasp and observe an object from various view points as well as listen to the sound during the observation. The proposed categorization method is an extension of probabilistic Latent Semantic Analysis(pLSA), which is a statistical technique. At the same time the proposed method provides a probabilistic framework for inferring the object property from limited observations. Validity of the proposed method is shown through some experimental results.",

In this paper, we propose a new concept, called wavefront collision, in order to do the same for all possible paths between n waypoints. It consists in expanding simultaneously one wavefront by waypoint, until they collide. Using this concept, all paths can be computed thanks to one multiple wavefront expansion instead of n - 1, hence dividing the computational effort by about 3.5.",

        "abstract": "This paper introduces a novel multirate feedforward control method for robot manipulators with elastic joints. Perfect tracking control methodology using multirate feedforward control was proposed by H. Fujimoto, et. al. Furthermore, A. Shimada, et. al. have described its application to robot manipulators; however, they only described the controller design process and gave a few simulation results. In addition, they did not provide details on how the state reference should be designed. Even if experiments are attempted, it is difficult to evaluate control performance since generally manipulators have joint angle sensors mounted on the output side of reduction gears, especially since the product of the angle of rotors and the reduction gear ratio does not always correspond with the joint angles. In order to solve this problem, this paper illustrates the design process for a state reference for manipulators, and introduces a prototype robot manipulator that has precision rotary encoders installed on the output side of the joints. This means that the manipulator as a platform not only has rotary encoders attached to servo motors but special rotary encoders. We describe experimental control results obtained by applying this control technique.",

We release the requirement that robots are equipped with sensors to estimate their own motion, as well as the requirement that covariance matrices describing system and measure noises are perfectly known. Robots are assumed to have a single sensor returning noisy measurements of mutual distances while they move along unknown paths. The proposed algorithm estimates online both the robots\u2019 poses as well as the unknown covariance parameters. In addition to the classical iterations of the well known iterated Kalman filter, we include iterations that propagate an approximation of the posterior marginal densities of the unknown variances. Simulationl results provide evidence that the algorithm is capable of accurately estimating the variances online while at the same time keeping the localization error bounded.",

First, a CAD system that integrated principles for multiscale approach in nanorobotics structure design is presented. Then, we focus in the different design levels, more specifically, the optimization of geometry structure carried out by quantum mechanics, molecular dynamics and continuum mechanics methodologies. As illustration of the proposed multiscale modeling concepts, we tested by simulation the dynamics characteristics of a nanorobotic parallel platform with one degree-of-freedom (DOF) composed of proteins-based passive kinematic chains and actuated by a viral protein-based nanoactuator. Multiscale simulations proved the effectiveness and accuracy of the proposed design and modeling approaches.",

The nanorobotic setup can be integrated into a scanning electron microscope (SEM) and various endeffectors may be attached to the manipulator either for CNT handling or characterization. The pick-and-place task is carried out by using an electrothermal actuated microgripper, designed for controlled manipulation of nanotubes. The nanotube is picked up from an array of multiwalled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) and transferred to the tip of an atomic force microscope (AFM) probe in order to assemble a high-aspect ratio AFM supertip. Another application of the nanorobotic setup considered in this paper is the nondestructive mechanical characterization of CNTs. A piezoresistive AFM probe is used to bend MWCNTs, while the bending force is measured, in order to estimate the Young's modulus of the investigated MWCNTs.",

In this paper, we present a methodology for natural task decomposition through the use of intrinsically meaningful potential fields. Specifically, we demonstrate that using classical conditioning measures in a concurrent control framework provides a domain-general means for solving tasks. Among the conditioning measures we use are manipulability [T. Yoshikawam, 1985], localizability [J. Uppala et al., 2002], and range of motion. To illustrate the value of our approach we demonstrate its applicability to an industrially relevant inspection task.",

The ability of the autonomous navigation begins with a path planner local and global. In this paper, we address a new local path planner using a Navigable Voronoi Diagram(NVD) which comes from the Voronoi Diagram(VD). The characteristics of the NVD are safety, smoothness, fast reaction and so on. The NVD is constructed from sonar sensor readings and is integrated with a cost function. Another important advantages of the NVD is that it can drastically reduce the uncertainty of cheap sonar sensor readings due to its nature. The proposed local path planner based on the NVD has been successfully implemented on a Pioneer 3 equipped with 12 sonar sensors and its advantages were verified by 2 experiments in different indoor environments.",

        "abstract": "A distributed two-tier near optimal algorithm is proposed for target tracking in sensor networks. Tier one is a multiple hypothesis tracking (MHT) algorithm where the Viterbi algorithm is used. In this tier, only binary data is used to obtain a rough region around the target. Tier two improves the accuracy of the MHT decision by localized maximum likelihood. This reduces the computational complexity and the communication costs between sensors over the global maximum likelihood approach. It also results in higher sensor power efficiency, hence longer service time of the tracking network. This two-tier system is a distributed near optimal tracking algorithm. The localized maximum likelihood tracking can tolerate errors made by the Viterbi algorithm in tier one, hence the overall algorithm is robust.",

The designed hand may be used either as prosthetic device or as humanoid robot end effector's. For these two applications, the shape, the weight and the energy consumption are important criteria to be taken into account in the design process. The reduction of actuators number decreases considerably the energy consumption and simplifies the control process. To satisfy this requirement, the proposed hand is an under- actuated mechanism having a total number of 15 degrees of freedom (DOF) and driven by only one motor. Each finger has 3 DOF for phalanxes flexion-extension movement. These flexion- extension movements of the five fingers are independents. They are driven by one motor and a binary mechanism allowing the selection of which phalanx is able to move or not. Simulation results showing a high capability of manipulating are given. The preliminary design of the adopted mechanism is also presented.",

        "abstract": "This paper focuses on a practical application of handling contact sensitive objects, such as silicon wafers or hard disk media by a human operator, without any mechanical contact using electrostatic levitation. Stable electrostatic levitation can be realized by controlling the electrostatic attractive force based on measured air gaps. A haptic device is combined with the electrostatic levitation system to minimize human disturbances to the levitated object. Especially during the picking up or placing of the object, where human disturbance is largest, instabilities can be prevented. For the human operator, the handling is easy and intuitive as the objects can be handled by simply moving the tool to the object. The interaction between operator, haptic device, and electrostatic levitation is described in detail. Experimental results show the characteristics of both the pick up task, as well as the place task, which is realized automatically without any external control command.",

        "abstract": "When grasping an object, friction forces are sometimes utilized effectively. This friction forces allows us to manipulate the object to various directions. Regarding such a grasped object posture, we reported an analysis on the 2Dspace grasping with two contact points. Selecting the square sum of the contact forces as an evaluation function of the object posture, we concluded that the optimal posture is the one where the midpoint of two contact points and the center of mass of the object align vertically. In this analysis, however, the friction condition is not taken into account, and thus this result is applied only to the grasp by use of fixtures, not to the one with frictions. In this paper, we aim at extending this result into the grasp with frictions. Especially, we analyze a grasp of circular object in the 2-D space in a numerical manner, and discuss the physical meaning of the optimal posture.",

Here we demonstrate in simulations and implementations in real robots that it is possible to simplify the architectures presented in previous work and to extend the approach to teams of n robots. The robots have no prior knowledge of the environment. The motion of each robot is controlled by a time series of asymptotical stable states. The attractor dynamics permits the integration of information from various sources in a graded manner. As a result, the robots show a strikingly smooth an stable team behaviour.",

This mechanism is designed based on the sequential situations when the robots likely have a chance to collide with each other. First, the obstacle avoidance is enabled if the distance between robot and obstacle is smaller than a designed distance and the obstacle is located on the way where the robot is moving to. Second, the time to turn on the mechanism for obstacle avoidance is decided by a predefined distance. Finally, an alternative path is generated for the robot to avoid obstacles by using a vector operation. Meanwhile, a robot behavior-based formation control is also constructed which has architecture of three levels. The developed mechanism is applied to the formation control of a group omni-directional driven robots. Simulation and experimental results show that the proposed algorithm is efficient for robot formation control.",

In order to acquire enough depth estimates for reliable OD during low visibility conditions, we propose a stereo disparity (depth) estimation approach that uses fine-to-coarse selection in a stereo image pyramid. This fine-to-coarse selection is based on a novel disparity validity metric that reflects the estimation reliability. Dense three-dimensional terrain data is reconstructed from the estimated stereo disparities. In our OD methods, several geometric properties, such as the terrain slope, are inspected to distinguish between obstacles and drivable terrain. This is achieved in a robust and efficient manner by considering the inherent uncertainty in stereo depth and using a hysteresis threshold. A large and varied collection of day- and nighttime images has been used to evaluate the performance of our system. The results show that our methods can reliably detect different types of obstacles in all tested conditions.",

The method is based on the tracking of the road markers assuming that the road is locally planar. Our aim is the development of a free-space estimator which can be implemented in an Autonomous Guided Vehicle to allow a safe path planning. Opposite to most of the obstacle detection methods which make assumptions on the shape or height of the obstacles, all the scene elements above the road plane (particularly kerbs and poles) have to be detected as obstacles.

In a simplified formulation, the driving principle for the system under consideration is based on controlling the position of the center of mass of the object, exploiting non-holonomic rolling constraint to propel the hemisphere. We derive the dynamic model of this system and establish the condition of motion realizability. Providing that this condition holds true, we derive an approximate analytical solution for the trajectory of the particle, driving the system along a pre-specified path in the contact coordinates. The approximation is based on ignoring the quadratic velocity terms in the dynamic equations.",

In order to speed up calculation, to keep the stability, and also to control the residual replacement, we adopt MSD (Mass-Spring- Damper) voxel-lattice model and calibrate their physical parameters by using differences against experimentally captured shapes. In general, a human operator manipulates the MSD model by the most popular graphics software OpenGL and force feedback device PHANTOM in a 3-D CG environment. In order to get wonderful visual and tactile realities, we need force and shape calculations less than a couple of 10 milli-seconds. For saving computational cost, we propose the octree-based MSD model. Based on several experimental and comparative results, we check whether twin goals such as efficiency of calculation time and precision of shape deformation are compatible or not in the octree-based MSD model.",

        "abstract": "We present a model-based 3D tracking system, using wide angle perspective catadioptric sensors. These sensors acquire 360deg views of the environment and the projection from 3D world points to the image plane is approximated by a perspective model. This is a major advantage in structured environments because straight lines on specific surfaces are not deformed by the sensor, allowing the application of standard computer vision algorithms. Objects off the surface are distorted according to a complex projection model, but can be approximated by a simple wide angle perspective mapping. This is exploited here to develop a robust tracking system for autonomous robots using a 3D shape and color-based object model. The use of particle filters allows tracking to be done with 3D realistic motion models and tackling object occlusion, overlap and ambiguities. We show that the use of the perspective model is advantageous over more standard catadioptric projection models, since it renders a very good approximation to the true model, being simpler and more efficient to use, in particular with 3D particle filtering methods.",

        "abstract": "Due to their flexibility in coverage and resolution, networked robotic cameras become more and more popular in applications such as natural observation, security surveillance, and distance learning. Equipped with a high optical zoom lens, a networked robotic camera can generate a giga-pixel-level panorama to cover its viewable region. As new live frames enter the system, this panorama can be updated as a panorama video. User requests are usually not limited to the current camera frame. A user may request a specific region associated with a specific time window. To satisfy different spatiotemporal requests for multiple concurrent users, we present systems and algorithms to allow the on-demand sharing of the high-resolution panorama video. The high-resolution panorama video is encoded into a patch-based representation to allow efficient storage and on-demand content delivery. We present system architecture, user interface, data representation, and encoding/decoding algorithms. In the experiment, we have implemented the system using the MPEG-2 codec. Experimental results show that our system can not only satisfy different spatiotemporal queries but also significantly reduce computation time and communication bandwidth requirement.",

A real-time energy-based method is proposed for estimating the dynamic friction force arising during soil-tool interaction. The method relies on a novel technique for measuring the force and displacement variables which allows the on-line determination of the bucket velocity and dissipation energy along the full excavation profile. It is shown that these measurements can be effectively used for the on-line identification and classification of different types of soil encountered during the excavation process. The proposed method is insensitive to noise and can be easily implemented in practice using an excavation arm and hydraulic actuators. Various experimental results are presented supporting the practicality of the proposed method.",

With the three disturbance models as inputs, a recurrent neural network is proposed to approach the forward model of the real ship, and the real time recurrent learning algorithm is described to train the forward model. Then neural-net controller is presented to reduce the roll, yaw and sway synthetically. This paper proposes the adaptation process of control system and applies it to the ship HD702.

        "abstract": "This paper addresses an on-line parameter adaptation for a momentum accumulation control of a space robot in the post-grasping of a tumbling target whose dynamic parameters are unknown a priori. The model inaccuracies in the target lead to an unexpected tumbling motion after grasping a target. It is desired to transfer the entire angular momentum to the reaction wheels as quickly as possible while stabilization trajectory of the robot-arm is tracked to avoid self-collision in the chaser-robot. Firstly, we derive a momentum control method from the angular momentum equation to accumulate the entire angular momentum into the reaction wheels. The parameter inaccuracies degrade the control performance. Then, an online adaptation law by using coupling force and momentum is proposed. A numerical simulation is carried out to verify the operational performance of the proposed method in the presence of model uncertainty.",

        "abstract": "This paper proposes an object recognition and gripping pose estimation approach based on on-line estimation of the complete set of inertial parameters, i.e. the mass, the coordinates of the center of mass, and the elements of the inertia matrix, of an object gripped by or attached to a manipulator. A multi-sensor fusion approach combining 6D force/torque, 6D acceleration, 3D angular velocity, and joint angle data to estimate these parameters is presented. In order to facilitate practical implementation, approaches to handling force/torque sensor offsets and to compensating the forces/torques caused by the distal mounting plate of the force/torque sensor and the gripper are incorporated. Regarding the joint angle signals, preprocessing steps to derive the angular velocity, linear acceleration and angular acceleration vector w.r.t. the sensor frame are addressed. The estimation of the complete set of inertial parameters employing the recursive instrumental variables (RIV) method is discussed. The extraction of features that are invariant w.r.t. translation and rotation, i.e. the mass and the principal moments of inertia, as well as a recognition approach based on the Kullback-Leibler divergence are presented. Experimental results show very low errors in the estimates of the inertial parameters, good pose estimation accuracy, and the viability of the recognition approach.",

        "abstract": "In this paper, we propose wrapped boosting that is extension of boosting algorithm for robust online action recognition. Boosting algorithm is one of ensemble learning algorithm and is also known as a feature selector. In our previous work utilizing boosting, we achieved automatic feature selection and robust model-based action classifiers which had very small calculation cost based on posture information of human body joints. However, which joints we should allocate posture sensors to must be given by humans in advance. Our new learning framework of wrapped boosting provides not only automatic feature selection but also automatic sensor allocation to proper joints of humans for target actions. We evaluated our algorithm targeting gait motion based on motion data fetched by motion capturing system. In consequence, wrapped boosting was able to select proper joints to which limited sensors should be attached, and to construct more robust classifiers compared to constructing classifiers with all joints available. Classifiers constructed only with existing boosting algorithm were subject to over-fitting to training data.",

        "abstract": "Simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) algorithms rely heavily on a good motion model to provide critical information about the robot's current pose. Most of these algorithms assume that the distribution defining a robot's motion will remain stationary over the period of operation, and as such use a fixed model for the duration of a trial. This does not easily allow for changes in the robot's motion model due to surface changes, wear and tear, and battery life. Also, if new robots of a similar class are to be used, a new motion model may need to be constructed from scratch. In this paper, we introduce a method that allows the robot to automatically learn its motion model, given a rough estimate of its model or the model from a robot of similar class. We validate our method by demonstrating that it learns a new motion model when a robot crosses a threshold onto a different surface. We also demonstrate our method can estimate the motion model for a new robot given the motion model of a robot of similar class.",

        "abstract": "An ontology-based multi-layered robot knowledge framework (OMRKF) is proposed to implement robot intelligence to be useful in a robot environment. OMRKF consists of four classes of knowledge (KClass), axioms and two types of rules. Four KClasses including perception, model, activity and context class are organized in a hierarchy of three knowledge levels (KLevel) and three ontology layers (OLayer). The axioms specify the semantics of concepts and relational constraints between ontological elements in each OLayer. One type of rule is designed for relationships between concepts in the same KClasses but in different KLevels. These rules will be used in a way of unidirectional reasoning. And, the other types of rules are also designed for association between concepts in different KLevels and different KClasses to be used in a way of bi-directional reasoning. These features will let OMRKF enable a robot to integrate robot knowledge from levels of sensor data and primitive behaviors to levels of symbolic data and contextual information regardless of class of knowledge. To show the validities of our proposed OMRKF, several experimental results will be illustrated, where some queries can be possibly answered by using uni-directional rules as well as bi-directional rules even with partial and uncertain information.",

The artificial muscle used for this underwater application is an ionic polymer metal composite (IPMC) which can generate bending motion in aquatic environments. In this research, the double ring structured nonlinear neural oscillator is proposed for generating undulatory motions in the water. The overall dynamic model of the flexible IPMC actuator including its fluid interaction terms is used for the motion planning and open-loop controller design. The IPMC used in this study is a patterned or segmented type where the electrode surface of the actuator is encoded such that each segment can be controlled independently for effectively generating an undulatory motion. Computer simulations show that the proposed neural oscillator based controller can be effectively used for the underwater locomotion applications, and can be extended to the closed-loop controller where the precise maneuver is needed in the unstructured aquatic environments. Experimental results are also presented to validate the proposed scheme.",

        "abstract": "Digital microfluidic systems (DMFS) are an emerging class of lab-on-a-chip systems that manipulate individual droplets of chemicals on a planar array of electrodes. The biochemical analyses are performed by repeatedly moving, mixing, and splitting droplets on the electrodes. In this paper, we focus on minimizing the completion time of biochemical analyses by exploiting the parallelism among the operations. We consider a binary tree representation of chemical analyses to schedule operations. Using pipelining, we overlap mixing operations with input and transportation operations. We find the lower bound of the mixing completion time according to the tree structure of given reactions, and calculate the minimal number of mixers S required to achieve the lower bound. We present a scheduling algorithm for the case with a specified number of mixers no more than S, and prove it is optimal to minimize the mixing completion time. We also analyze resource constraint issues for two extreme cases. For the case with one mixer, we prove that all schedules result in the same mixing completion time as long as the mixer is kept busy at all times and then design a scheduling algorithm to minimize the number of storage units. For the case with zero storage units, we find the minimum number of mixers required. Finally, we demonstrate the benefits of our scheduling methods on an example of DNA polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analysis.",

Appropriate probabilistic error functions are defined for the weak algorithm to evaluate their suitability in the task. An on-line boosting algorithm is employed to derive a final strong algorithm starting from two weak algorithms. This strong one has superior performance both in image and Cartesian spaces.

Further, the particular expressiveness of a pure functional language with first-class closures captures so cleanly certain biologically-inspired behaviors that program specification often becomes compact enough to allow a programmer to visually inspect the program code for the entire swarm at once. This benefit comes in contrast to more piece-meal construction methods used to build-up robot software from discrete components. While such programming models capture the engineered structure of a robotic system, the dynamic, decentralized qualities sought after in robot swarms are well-matched by the idioms of functional concurrent programming.",

We seek to compute the state covariance without using the first-order linear approximations of the extended Kalman filter. We consider, unlike standard work done in error propagation and data fusion, the possible correlation between the different sensor pose estimates, odometry and DGPS for the present work, and the autocorrelation of some of the variables involved in the fusion (DGPS data, for the particular case herein presented). Computation of the covariances of each sensor data vector is presented so it takes into account the vehicle kinematics, and hence, its particular characteristics. In order to validate the presented approach, a real outdoor navigation experiment is presented fusing odometry and DGPS data.",

Local 3D geometries are reconstructed between the neighboring reference images in order to achieve fast feature prediction which allows the recovery from tracking failures. During navigation the robot is controlled using image-based visual servoing. The experiments show that the framework is robust against moving objects and moderate illumination changes.

Very soon, mission requirements will impose that planetary exploration rovers drive over-the-horizon in a single command cycle. This require an evolution of the methods and technologies currently used. This paper presents experimental validation of our over-the-horizon autonomous planetary navigation. We present our approach to 3D terrain reconstruction from large sparse range data sets, localization and autonomous navigation in a Mars-like terrain. Our approach is based on on-line acquisition of range scans, map construction from these scans, path planning and navigation using the map. An autonomy engine supervises the whole process ensuring the safe navigation of the planetary rover. The outdoor experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the reconstructed terrain model for rover localization, path planning and motion execution scenario as well as the autonomy capability of our approach.",

The essence of dynamic biped gait generation is mechanical energy restoration, and parametric excitation approach is a good idea for it. Our novel approach does not require any rotational actuation and thus enables to be free from the constraint of zero moment point (ZMP). This paper considers some basic methods of parametric excitation and shows that energy-efficient biped locomotion can achieved very easily without taking the ZMP condition into account. We then conduct parametric studies by adjusting the control and physical parameters, and determine how well the basic gait perform by introducing some performance indices.",

First, we will develop a reliable 2D range data leg detector using the AdaBoost algorithm. Second, instead of using the leg detector to detect people, we propose a more reliable method that takes into account the spatial arrangement of the detected legs. The method is inspired by the latest results on the \"part-based representations\" from the computer vision area. Finally, we show how the part-based representations can be used to combine the leg detections from the 2D range data and upper body, lower body and full body detections from omnidirectional camera. The experimental results show highly reliable people detection when the two sensors are combined. We use Haar-like features and the AdaBoost again to construct the omnicam body parts detectors.",

A motion planning method that can connect two configurations with dynamic stability is proposed. It consists of \"motion path planner\" and \"motion timing planner\". Motion path planner can generate statically stable motion under considering joint movable range and collision avoidance. Motion timing planner can generate dynamically stable motion under considering ZMP conditions and maximum joint velocities.

The interaction force between motor and load is directly proportional to their relative position, which corresponds to the elongation of the elastic element. This way, the torque control task is transformed to a position control task, which comes natural to traditional DC motors. In this paper, several existing control strategies are analyzed and compared with respect to passivity concerns. Cascaded control with a fast inner velocity loop results to be the best option. Based on the analysis, boundaries for the parameters are presented, such that the force controller may contain integral action without jeopardizing passivity.",

However, such mechanisms always slip when a tracked vehicle follows a curve, and the slippage generates large accumulated positioning errors in the vehicle compared with conventional wheeled mobile robots. To improve the accuracy of the odometry and enable a path-following control, the estimation of the track slippage is essential. In this paper, we propose an improved method of odometry for tracked vehicles to follow a straight line or a curve. In this method, the vehicle estimates the slip ratios using two encoders (attached to the actuators) and a gyro-sensor. Based on the improved odometry, the path-following control of tracked vehicles is significantly improved. The validity of the method was confirmed with experiments involving our tracked vehicle on several types of surfaces.",

Known obstacles are acquired offline and stored in a world model, unknown obstacles are acquired online by one or multiple sensors. This is a typical situation for many applications. The method presented here exploits this distinction by building a static roadmap based on known obstacle information. This enables efficient path planning and real-time performance using bounded lazy evaluation thus reducing the number of costly collision test. The dynamics of the workspace are addressed by invalidation/revalidation of roadmap edges based on sensoric input. Several revalidation strategies are evaluated. The proposed path planner is probabilistically complete and utilizes global environment information to assure goal arrival, if the goal is reachable. Our approach is realized using standard PC hardware with computational requirements allowing real-time performance. Experimental results show the validity of our approach.",

This work is motivated by the recent success of convex optimization methods in solving geometric inference problems in computer vision. We formulate the visual servoing problem with feature visibility constraints as a convex optimization of a function of the camera position i.e. the translation of the camera. First, the path is planned using potential field method that produces unconstrained but straight line path from the initial to the desired camera position. The problem is then converted to a constrained convex optimization problem by introducing the visibility constraints to the minimization problem. The objective of the minimization process is to find for each camera position the closest alternate position from which all features are visible. This algorithm ensures that the solution is optimal. This formulation allows the introduction of more constraints, like joint limits of the arm, into the visual servoing process. The results have been illustrated in a simulation framework.",

In this paper, a pen-type sensor is proposed for sensing surface roughness. The sensor with a rigid contact probe is able to measure 3D contact forces and the dynamic contact responses along the axial direction of the probe, which facilitate the roughness representation using parameters of roughness profile rather than complex, high level interpretation methods. Strain gauges and a force sensor are used for measuring contact forces and a PVDF sensor is used for the dynamic sensing. The sensor is a self-contained one, and it can transmit sensed data via Bluetooth to the host computer. As preliminary tests, experiments are performed on the measurement of the coefficient of friction and the response to dynamic stimuli of different surface patterns.",

        "abstract": "To realize accurate tracking of people in the environment, many studies have been proposed using vision sensors, floor sensors, and wearable devices. The problem of using vision sensors is that they do not provide ID information of each people and there are ambiguities when people come across. To solve the problem, we propose to combine acceleration sensors that are attached to the human body. Since the signals from vision sensors and acceleration sensors synchronize when they observe same person who are acting or walking in the environment, these signals are not independent. The correlation between the signals is evaluated based on the canonical correlation analysis. Experimental results are shown to detect gesture and to track people to confirm the effectiveness of the proposed method.",

        "abstract": "Mobile robots are said to be capable of self- assembly when they can autonomously form physical connections with each other. Despite the recent proliferation of self- assembling systems, little work has been done on using self- assembly to add functional value to a robotic system, and even less on quantifying the contribution of self-assembly to system performance. In this study we demonstrate and quantify the performance benefits of i) acting as a physically larger self-assembled entity, ii) using self-assembly adaptively and iii) making the robots morphologically aware (the self-assembled robots leverage their new connected morphology in a task specific way). In our experiments, two real robots must navigate to a target over a-priori unknown terrain. In some cases the terrain can only be overcome by a self-assembled connected entity. In other cases, the robots can reach the target faster by navigating individually.",

BSFS uses Lucas-Kanade feature detection and matching in order to determine the location of the person in the image and thereby control the robot. Matching is performed between two images of a stereo pair, as well as between successive video frames. We use the Random Sample Consensus (RANSAC) scheme for segmenting the sparse disparity map and estimating the motion models of the person and background. By fusing motion and stereo information, BSFS handles difficult situations such as dynamic backgrounds, out-of-plane rotation, and similar disparity and/or motion between the person and background. Unlike color-based approaches, the person is not required to wear clothing with a different color from the environment. Our system is able to reliably follow a person in complex dynamic, cluttered environments in real time.",

In this paper we aim to show that a polyhedral object can be displaced to arbitrary position and orientation on a plane (i.e. such a pivoting system is controllable). More than that we show it is small time controllable, i.e. the reachable space from a starting point contains always a neighbor no matter how cluttered the environment is. As a consequence of this analysis, we propose a steering method to plan a manipulation path to be performed by a humanoid robot: first we use a classical nonholonomic path planner that accounts for the robot motion constraints, and then we transform that path into a sequence of pivoting operations. While the feasibility of elementary pivoting tasks has been already experienced by the humanoid robot HRP-2, we present here the very first simulations of the plans generated by our steering method.",

By simulating the robot's perception system during search, our planner generates a metric, the so-called perceptive capability, that quantifies the 'sensability' of the environment in each state given the task to be accomplished. We have applied our method to the problem of planning robust autonomous manipulations as performed by a humanoid robot in a kitchen environment. Our results indicate that reasoning about the future perceptive capability has the potential to greatly facilitate any task requiring visual feedback during control of the robot manipulator and can thus ensure higher task success rates than perception-unaware planning.",

We comparatively describe the two robot setups, the control schemes, and the grasp type determination. We show that the grasp strategy can robustly cope with inaccurate control and object variation. We demonstrate that it can be ported among platforms with minor modifications. Grasping success is evaluated by comparative experiments performing a benchmark test on 21 everyday objects.",

The concept of polarization is introduced to computer vision to detect water hazards for autonomous off-road navigation. This method is based on the physical principle that the light reflected from water surface is partial linearly polarized and the polarization phases of them are more similar than those from the scenes around. Water hazards can be detected by comparison of polarization degree and similarity of the polarization phases. Experiments show that the method has good performance in water detection in complex natural backgrounds, especially when there is vegetation reflected in the water. This method has significant complementary advantages with respect to existing techniques, is computationally efficient, and can be easily implemented with existing imaging technology.",

        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "For the operation planning of robotically assisted laparoscopic surgery, the most critical issues are the trocar port placement in the patient's body (incision entry port for intervention) and the pose selection of the robot (docking of the robot). These significantly affect the robot's dexterity, manipulability, reachability, and visibility, which are essential to the success of the surgical procedure. Experienced surgeons still have difficulty solving these problems. Because of possible robot part collisions, the optimal placement of ports may differ for robotically assisted procedures in comparison to traditional MIS. This paper proposes the choice of the best port location and determination of the pose of the robot based on optimization equations that are in turn based on certain evaluation criteria. Two performance measures are proposed: the global isotropy index (GII ), which has been developed to optimize the robot's dexterity, and the efficiency index (EI) to maximize the reachability and visibility of the robot. Computerized simulations of the da Vinci surgical system for surgery in synthetic box environments are performed to find out the optimal solutions. A direct way to evaluate the feasibility of the performance measures for collision-free intervention is also illustrated. It is proved that the GII and EI are correlated and complementary.

Our framework uses position and velocity signals to achieve position tracking in free motion. It also uses force feedback for compensating the human/environment disturbances to achieve position coordination in contact tasks. In passifying position and velocity feedback terms, for simplicity reasons there is no need to consider the dynamics of the robotic systems as long as they satisfy Euler-Lagrangian dynamic system equation. However when the force feedback is applied, we have to consider the dynamics of the robot in controller design. We do passivity analysis in the frequency domain by using Parseval\u2019s identity. Simulation has been performed to illustrate the proposed algorithm and to clarify some points in the design procedure.",

The proposed algorithm is based on three key ideas. Firstly, by introducing the global-map postponement method, approximations necessary for ensuring linear computational complexity are delayed over many time steps. Then by employing the power method, only the most informative of the Kalman vectors, generated during the postponement phase, are retained for updating the covariance matrix. This in effect minimizes the information loss during each approximation epoch. Finally, linear-complexity, rank-2 updates, which minimize the trace of the covariance matrix, are applied to increase the speed of convergence of the estimator. In addition to being consistent, the resulting estimator has processing requirements that can be adjusted to the availability of computational resources. Simulation results are presented that demonstrate the accuracy of the proposed algorithm (Power-SLAM) when compared to the quadratic computational cost standard EKF-based SLAM, and two linear- complexity competing alternatives.",

The scalability of planning and reasoning methods to cope with complex problems in such environments crucially depends on exploiting this structure. We propose a new approach to planning in robotics based on probabilistic inference. The method uses structured Dynamic Bayesian Networks to represent the scenario and efficient inference techniques (loopy belief propagation) to solve planning problems. In principle, any kind of factored or hierarchical state representations can be accounted for.

        "abstract": "This paper describes a method of probabilistic obstacle map building based on Bayesian estimation. Most active or passive obstacle sensors observe only the most frontal objects and any objects behind them are occluded. Since the observation of distant places includes large depth errors, a conventional method, which does not consider the sensor occlusion often, generate erroneous maps. We introduce a probabilistic observation model, which determines the visible objects. We first estimate probabilistic visibility from the current viewpoint by a Markov chain model based on the knowledge of the average sizes of obstacles and free areas. Then the likelihood of the observations based on the probabilistic visibility are estimated and then the posterior probability of each map grid are updated by Bayesian update rule. Experimental results show that more precise map building can be built by this method.",

A new force reflection algorithm is proposed which improves the stability of the system without decreasing its transparency. Based on an estimate of the human forces provided by a high-gain input observer, the proposed algorithm restricts the reflected force in such a way that it eliminates the motion of the master induced by the force reflection signal without changing the human perception of the environmental force. It is shown that the force reflection algorithm proposed allows to achieve stability of the system for arbitrarily high force-reflection gain and arbitrarily low damping/stiffness of the master manipulator.",

This paper presents a leg stretch reflex and anti-slip retraction algorithm that are added to a previously presented controller to stabilize a high-speed trot over uneven terrain. Together with fuzzy control and a force redistribution algorithm, these control mechanisms stabilize a quadruped trot at 5.25 m/s. The quadruped can turn at 30 deg/s when running at 3.0 m/s, and can maneuver over uneven terrain with standard deviation of height variation of 3 cm at 4.0 m/s. This appears to be the first reported control of high-speed quadrupedal running over uneven terrain.",

        "abstract": "This paper explores the use of statical learning methods on randomized path planning algorithms. A continuous, randomized version of A* is presented along with an empirical analysis showing planning time convergence rates in the robotic manipulation domain. The algorithm relies on several heuristics that capture a manipulator's kinematic feasibility and the local environment. A statistical framework is used to learn one of these heuristics from a large amount of training data saving the need to manually tweak parameters every time the problem changes. Using the appropriate formulation, we show that motion primitives can be automatically extracted from the training data in order to boost planning performance. Furthermore, we propose a randomized statistical path planning (RSPP) paradigm that outlines how a planner using heuristics should take advantage of machine learning algorithms. Planning results are shown for several manipulation problems tested in simulation.",

        "abstract": "The existing reinforcement learning approaches have been suffering from the curse of dimension problem when they are applied to multiagent dynamic environments. One of the typical examples is a case of RoboCup competitions since other agents and their behaviors easily cause state and action space explosion. This paper presents a method of modular learning in a multiagent environment by which the learning agent can acquire cooperative behaviors with its team mates and competitive ones against its opponents. The key ideas to resolve the issue are as follows. First, a two-layer hierarchical system with multi learning modules is adopted to reduce the size of the sensor and action spaces. The state space of the top layer consists of the state values from the lower level, and the macro actions are used to reduce the size of the physical action space. Second, the state of the other to what extent it is close to its own goal is estimated by observation and used as a state value in the top layer state space to realize the cooperative/competitive behaviors. The method is applied to 4 (defense team) on 5 (offense team) game task, and the learning agent successfully acquired the teamwork plays (pass and shoot) within much shorter learning time (30 times quicker than the earlier work).",

In order to design such an artifact\u2019s behavior, we could exploit human psychological functions - theory of mind (ToM) - the ability to interpret other people\u2019s behavior in terms of intentional causal mental states such as beliefs, desires and intentions. In order to apply theory of mind to human-robot interaction, the mechanism that trigger intention attribution must be revealed. The present study examined the effect of reactive movements performed by a non-humanoid robot, including different shaped artifact: chair and cube, on the intention attribution. The result indicated that whether or not humans could construe behaviors of an artifact in terms of its goal depends on how human could attribute intention to the artifact and that reactive movements would be a cue for such mental state attribution.",

The processed signals are directly used for the motion generation of virtual arm in real time simulator. The virtual arm of simulator has two degrees of freedom and complies with the desired flexion/extension motions of both the elbow and shoulder of human.

The system runs in real-time so that the robot can work in an uncertain environment. It is based on virtual forces between close segments of the robot. The avoidance movements are blended with a whole body motion control in order to change the priority between target reaching and collision avoidance. The blending is performed autonomously without the necessity of external switching. Our method works both while the robot is standing and walking. Reaching motions from the front to the side of the body without the arm colliding with the body are possible. Even if the target is inside the body, the arm stops at the closest point to the target outside of the body. Our method can be used for other applications: We apply it to realizing a \"body schema\" and for \"occlusion avoidance.\"",

        "abstract": "Measuring human movement in real time is of primary importance in a number of new applications of interactive systems and human centered robotics. A major difficulty in this field arises from the high joint redundancy of the human kinematics. Conventional approaches address this problem by installing a rather large number of sensors or markers on the subject. On the other hand, well admitted theories in neurosciences claim that joint synchronization in human movements is governed by so-called synergies, that can be viewed as joint patterns corresponding to a given gesture of a given individual. In this paper, we intend to exploit this property in order to reduce the number of sensors to be installed on a human subject when tracking his/her motion. Namely, our suggested method comprizes two phases. In a learning stage, the subject is asked to complete a given gesture a few times, while he/she is equipped with sensors able to measure his/her full posture. An algorithm is thus used in a second phase to reduce the required number of sensors while reconstructing the whole posture of the subject. Experimental evidence is provided for the particular motion of sit-to-stand transfer, in a study that involves healthy subjects.",

        "abstract": "This paper presents a real-time surveillance system to track multiple moving objects by controlling a pan-tilt camera platform. In order to describe the relationship between the targets and camera in this surveillance system, the input/output hidden Markov model (HMM) is applied here in the well-defined spherical camera coordinate. Since the targets are hard to be distinguished with one single camera when they are close to each other, we extend the particle filter for multitarget tracking with depth level estimate to track interacting targets. The targets overlapping each other still can be tracked in the images captured by single camera. Furthermore, an optimal camera action selection strategy is proposed to track multitarget within its limited field of view. The maximization of mutual information for the action design is formalized and implemented by the Monte Carlo method. The overall performance has been validated in the experiments of real-time tracking.",

To respond selectively to approaching objects on direct collision course, the sensor employs an algorithm inspired by the visual nervous system in a locust, which can avoid a collision robustly by using visual information. We implemented the architecture of the locust nervous system with a compact hardware system which contains mixed analogdigital integrated circuits consisting of an analog resistive network and field-programmable gate array (FPGA) circuits. The response properties of the system were examined by using simulated movie images, and the system was tested also in realworld situations by loading it on a motorized car. The system was confirmed to respond selectively to colliding objects even in complicated real-world situations.",

We present a novel algorithm to plan the actions of the two robots in the team, one leader and one helper, in real-time to accomplish the task while avoiding other obstacles in the unknown dynamic environment. Our algorithm does not assign fixed roles to the two team members, but rather it dynamically decides who should lead based on circumstances to optimize the team\u2019s performance. The planner is readily extensible to handle a team of more than two robots in tight collaboration. The approach is implemented and tested in simulated task environments, which demonstrate the planning algorithm\u2019s effectiveness and efficiency.",

It is exclusively based on the information provided by a cheap wide-angle stereo camera. Our approach divide the global map into local sub- maps identified by the so-called SIFT fingerprint. At the sub- map level (low level SLAM), 3D sequential mapping of natural land-marks and the robot location/orientation are obtained using a top-down Bayesian method to model the dynamic behavior. A high abstraction level to reduce the global accumulated drift, keeping real-time constraints, has been added (high level SLAM). This uses a SIFT correction method based on the sub-maps' fingerprints. A comparison of the low SLAM level using our method and SIFT features has been carried out. Some experimental results using a real large environment are presented.",

The visual angle between two landmarks can be derived from their projections in the same image. The distances between the optical center and the landmarks can be calculated from the visual angles and the known landmark positions based on the law of cosine. The robot position can be determined using the principle of trilateration. The robot orientation is then computed from the robot position, landmark positions and their projections. Extensive simulation has been carried out. A comprehensive error analysis provides the insight on how to improve the localization accuracy.",

When robots share information, they inadvertently share the error associated with that information. In this research, we realistically assume that all position-based data has some amount of localization error. We model the propagation of this error in cooperative search. We conjecture that propagation of error differs based on whether search targets are shared or locally discovered.

In order to use redundancy effectively, the contribution of all actuators for the achievement of the target motions and capability for unpredictable target motions in the future should be considered. From this point of view, two evaluation indices, the movability index of each joint and the assistability index for the target motions are proposed. These indices are formulated with the angle and amplitude distribution of the column vectors of Jacobian matrices of each joint, including the end-effector. Then joint input to optimize these indices simultaneously are derived based on the improved gradient projection method. Motion control simulations and experiments with a planar 10R serial manipulator revealed the effectiveness of the proposed method.",

In general, UVMS has redundant degrees of freedom(DOFs) as many as DOFs of manipulator and these redundant DOFs can be used to optimize the configuration of UVMS while satisfying given tasks. We propose a performance index for redundancy resolution which minimizes the restoring moments of UVMS. The restoring moment is induced from gravity and buoyancy forces and it can cause unintentional change of poses of UVMS. If the restoring moments remain small, control effort for keeping the poses of UVMS decreases. This means that energy consumption can be reduced by minimizing the restoring moments during conducting tasks. We solve inverse kinematics of UVMS using well-known weighted pseudo-inverse matrixes and we optimize the restoring moments by adopting gradient projection method. Numerical simulations are presented to demonstrate performance of the proposed algorithm.",

        "abstract": "This paper proposes a walker system with power assistance device for standing up motion. Our system focuses on family use for aged person who needs nursing in their daily life. Our key ideas are two topics. The first topic is new assistance manipulator mechanism with four parallel linkages. Our proposed manipulator mechanism requires only smaller actuators and realizes rigid structure with lighter linkages comparing with general manipulator. Thus, we can design our assistance system compactly with low-cost using our mechanism. The second topic is the combination of force and position control. According to the patient\u2019s posture during standing up, our control system selects more appropriate control method from them. We use the reference of standing-up motion which is based on the typical standing up motion by nursing specialist for realizing the natural assistance. The performance of our proposed assistance system is verified by computer simulations and experiments using our prototype.",

        "abstract": "This paper presents a coarse coding technique and an action selection scheme for reinforcement learning (RL) in multi-dimensional and continuous state-action spaces following conventional and sound RL manners. RL in high-dimensional continuous domains includes two issues: One is a generalization problem for value-function approximation, and the other is a sampling problem for action selection over multi-dimensional continuous action spaces. The proposed method combines random rectangular coarse coding with an action selection scheme using Gibbs-sampling. The random rectangular coarse coding is very simple and quite suited both to approximate Q-functions in high-dimensional spaces and to execute Gibbs sampling. Gibbs sampling enables us to execute action selection following Boltsmann distribution over high-dimensional action space. The algorithm is demonstrated through Rod in maze problem and a redundant-arm reaching task comparing with conventional regular grid approaches.",

        "abstract": "This paper describes an improved methodology for human motion recognition and imitation based on Factorial Hidden Markov Models (FHMM). Unlike conventional Hidden Markov Models (HMMs), FHMMs use a distributed state representation, which allows for more efficient representation of each time sequence. Once the FHMMs are trained with exemplar motion data, they can be used to generate sample trajectories for motion production, and produce significantly more accurate trajectories compared to single Hidden Markov chain models. Due to the additional information encoded in FHMMs models, FHMM models have a higher Kullback- Leibler distance compared to single Markov chain models, making it easier to distinguish between similar models. The efficacy of using FHMMs is tested on a database of human motions obtained through motion capture. The results show that FHMMs provide better generalization to new data when compared to conventional HMMs during motion recognition, as well as providing a better fit for generated data.",

        "abstract": "To address privacy concerns with digital video surveillance cameras, we propose a practical, real-time approach that preserves the ability to observe actions while obscuring individual identities. In our proposed respectful cameras system, people who wish to remain anonymous agree to wear colored markers such as a hat or vest. The system automatically tracks these markers using statistical learning and classification to infer the location and size of each face and then inserts elliptical overlays. Our objective is to obscure the face of each individual wearing a marker, while minimizing the overlay area in order to maximize the remaining observable region of the scene. Our approach incorporates a visual color-tracker based on a 9 dimensional color-space by using a probabilistic AdaBoost classifier with axis-aligned hyperplanes as weak-learners. We then use particle filtering to incorporate interframe temporal information. We present experiments illustrating the performance of our system in both indoor and outdoor settings, where occlusions, multiple crossing targets, and lighting changes occur. Results suggest that the respectful camera system can reduce false negative rates to acceptable levels (under 2%).",

Object recognition and workspace reconstruction also enable 3D user interaction and programming of assembly operations. In this paper a novel method for synthesizing robot grasps from demonstration is presented. The system allows learning and classification of human grasps demonstrated in virtual reality as well as teaching of robot grasps and simulation of manipulation tasks. Both virtual grasp demonstration and grasp synthesis take advantage of a topology-preserving approach for automatic workspace modeling with a monocular camera. The method is based on the computation of edge-face graphs. The algorithm works in real-time and shows high scalability in the number of objects thus allowing accurate reconstruction and registration from multiple views. Grasp synthesis is performed mimicking the human hand pre-grasp motion with data smoothing. Experiments reported in the paper have tested the capabilities of both the vision algorithm and the grasp synthesizer.",

        "abstract": "Increasingly, personalised robots - robots especially designed and programmed for an individual's needs and preferences - are being used to support humans in their daily lives, most notably in the area of service robotics. Arguably, the closer the robot is programmed to the individual's needs, the more useful it is, and we believe that giving people the opportunity to program their own robots, rather than programming robots for them, will push robotics research one step further in the personalised robotics field. However, traditional robot programming techniques require specialised technical skills from different disciplines and it is not reasonable to expect end-users to have these skills. In this paper, we therefore present a new method of obtaining robot control code - programming by demonstration through system identification - which algorithmically and automatically transfers human behaviours into robot control code, using transparent, analysable mathematical functions. Besides providing a simple means of generating perception-action mappings, they have the additional advantage that can also be used to form hypotheses and theoretical analysis of robot behaviour. We demonstrate the viability of this approach by teaching a Scitos G5 mobile robot to achieve wall following and corridor passing behaviours.",

The motivation for introducing an image-guided robot is to improve safety by preventing the surgeon from violating critical structures during the drilling procedure. Our approach is to attach the cutting tool to the robot end-effector and operate the robot in a cooperative control mode, where robot motion is determined from the forces and torques applied by the surgeon.

        "abstract": "An important tool in clarifying various theories governing the dynamics of rapid quadrupedal gaits, such as the trot and gallop, is the measurement of body attitude. Such measurements are complicated in open field environments because of the large ranges and high data rates needed due to the speeds (7 m/s) and rapid shifts in dynamics present. To address this a lightweight inertial sensing harness is introduced with sensing design based on the KOLT robot. Its mass center is collocated with the subject so as to reduce dynamic bias. This work combines dynamic gait system identification and motion estimation and is demonstrated on a Labrador retriever (Canis lupus familiaris) through measurements of the gallop over long spans (20 m) and at data rates comparable with gait laboratories (400 Hz). The results are consistent with laboratory measurements, but seem to suggest a roll and yaw cross-coupling during gallop.",

        "abstract": "This paper presents a method that enables a conversational domestic robot to learn location names through speech interaction. Each acquired name is associated with a point on the map coordinate system of the robot. Both for acquisition and recognition of location names, a bag- of-words-based categorization technique is used. Namely, the robot acquires a location name as a frequency pattern of words, and recognizes a spoken location name by computing similarity between the patterns. This makes the robot robust not only against speech recognition errors but also against out- of-vocabulary names. We designed a dialogue and behavior management subsystem that learns location names by using our proposed method and navigates to indicated locations, and implemented the subsystem on an omnidirectional cart robot. The result of a preliminary evaluation of the implemented robot with human subjects suggested this approach is promising.",

In the first step, a virtual control is designed for the rigid link dynamic by the nonlinear H-infinity method. In second and third steps, the other virtual control and real control are designed using the saturation-type nonlinear control based on the Lyapunov\u2019s second method. In each step, the designed robust inputs satisfy the L2-gain, which is equal to or less than \u2014 in the input-output sense of the closed loop system. In contrast with the previous researches, the proposed control method does not need the information of the acceleration and desire jerk of the links for the feedback control law. The performance robustness of the proposed control is verified through a series of computer simulations of a 2-DOF robot manipulator with joint flexibility.",

        "abstract": "A widespread application of impedance control in industrial robotic systems is still a challenging problem. One of limitations is the absence of a widely-accepted framework for the synthesis of the impedance control parameters that ensure stability of both contact transition and interaction processes and guarantee desired contact performance. The existing design procedures based on robot passivity appear to be exceedingly conservative in applications in which the interaction between an industrial robot and a stiff environment should be controlled. The proposed new interaction stability paradigm ensures contact stability during all phases of interaction. Moreover, the new design framework realizes low-impedance performance allowing considerable reduction of high apparent industrial robot inertia and stiffness. The novel stability criteria are established based on robust control theory and take into account estimates of environmental stiffness, tolerating thereby large uncertainties and variations in industrial environments. These criteria are proved by extensively testing in industrial and space robots and have been recently extended to control synthesis of human robot interaction systems (haptic admittance displays and rehabilitation robots).",

        "abstract": "This paper presents a robust design for the general bilateral teleoperation system with Markov jumping parameters. Although passivity-based approach and robust design-based approach can stabilize the bilateral teleoperation system, sufficient conditions are too conservative. In this paper, requirements for a general bilateral teleoperation system are given first. Next, time delays on the internet are modeled by a Markov process with nine states, three for the forward communication branch and three for the backward communication branch. Based on the requirements of the master and the slave controllers, the standard robust design are carried out. Then, with the model of internet time delays, the bilateral teleoperation system is reconstructed by a Markov jumping system. Based on the mode-dependent stability conditions for the stochastic time delay system, the closed-loop controller is designed to obtain the less conservative stable system and to therefore improve the performance of tracking and transparency. Simulation has been carried out and the results verify the feasibility and efficiency of the proposed approach.",

        "abstract": "Recently, many vision-based SLAM methods have achieved good results using visual features. However, most algorithms suffer from the accumulated error that inevitably occurs. In this paper, we propose a robust loop detection method by matching image features between the incoming image and key-frame images saved in SLAM. Loop detection is a task of deciding whether a robot has returned to a previously visited area or not. Because a camera is unlikely to have the same pose when a robot revisits the place where it previously encountered, it is crucial to match the features under the different views of the scene. In contrast with view-invariant features, it is hard to match corner points in that situation due to the large variation of neighboring pixels. So we present the robust corner matching method under the view changes. Experimental results demonstrate the capability of the loop closing and mobile robot localization under the different views using the proposed method.",

This paper presents a novel clustered particle filter based approach to lane detection, which is suitable for urban streets in normal traffic conditions. Furthermore, a quality measure for the detection is calculated as a measure of reliability. The core of this approach is the usage of weak models, i.e. the avoidance of strong assumptions about the road geometry. Experiments were carried out in Sydney urban areas with a vehicle mounted laser range scanner and a ccd camera. Through experimentations, we have shown that a clustered particle filter can be used to efficiently extract lane markings.",

        "abstract": "This paper studies robust performance analysis of H2/Hinfin control problem in time-varying systems. In the case where the state-space matrices of the system depend affinely on the uncertain parameters, it is known that recently developed extended or dilated linear matrix inequalities (LMIs) are effective to assess the robust performance in a less conservative fashion. This paper further probes into those preceding results and proposes a new form of extended LMIs for time-varying H2/Hinfin controllers synthesis. The new method enables us to parameterize controllers without involving the Lyapunov variables in the parameterization. The numerical simulations prove the validity of this framework.",

This method is similar to more classical non-linear pose computation techniques. Robustness is obtained by integrating an M- estimator into the virtual visual control law via an iteratively re- weighted least squares implementation. The presented approach is also extended to the use of multiple cameras. Results show the method to be robust to occlusion, changes in illumination and miss-tracking.",

As the robot walks, a large disturbance is introduced. A human kicks the robot in its midsection causing the robot to fall into three separate clusters of five modules. Each of these pieces diagnose their state sensing gravity and their connectedness. They each perform a self-righting maneuver, then begin to search for each other. This is a first demonstration towards the development of solving larger self-reassembly problems that include greater levels of randomization and entropy (more pieces more widely distributed.) The 2006 Robotics Science and Systems workshop on self-reconfigurable robots developed as one of the grand challenges for this area, the ability to survive and self-repair after an explosion. This work will push the technologies required for integrated sensing, localization, distributed control, under highly unstructured conditions.",

In remote environments, temporal disparity in tactile sensations is caused by temporal latency between a touch motion of the operator and a tactile stimulus applied on him. A framework of tactile telepresence systems, which is suitable in remote environments, has been proposed in the present paper. In the framework, a tactile display locally generates the tactile stimulus in synchronization with the touch motion of the operator in order to cancel communication delay. The tactile stimulus is generated by combining the motion and tactile factors, which are sensed by a tactile sensor. The factors are characteristic parameters of objects and effect on tactile sensations. In the present paper, physical parameters of the objects are selected as the factors because the tactile stimuli can be computed using physical models involving the motions and the parameters. Based on the proposed framework, a roughness feeling telepresence system was implemented and successfully transferred a roughness factor to the operator.",

In this paper we present a new technique that allows the use of local mapping algorithms in the context of EKF SLAM but without the constrain of probabilistic independence between local maps. By means of this procedure, salient features of the environment or vehicle state components as velocity or global attitude, can be shared between local maps without affecting the posterior joining process or introducing any undesirable approximations in the final global map estimate. The overload cost introduced by the technique is minimum since building up local maps does not require any additional operations apart from the usual EKF steps. As the algorithm works with covariance matrices, well-known data association techniques can be used in the usual manner. To test the technique, experimental results using a monocular camera in an outdoor environment are provided. The initialization of the features is based on the inverse depth algorithm.",

Rather than developing smaller actuators, the main actuator is removed entirely. Energy instead comes from the environment to provide motion in prescribed synchronous ways. Prescribed synchronous motions allow much faster assembly times than random Brownian motion which has been used before. An instantiation of this idea is presented using a motion platform to induce motions based on the inertial properties of the modules and the timed actuation of small latching mechanisms.",

        "abstract": "Numerous scale-invariant feature matching algorithms using scale-space analysis have been proposed for use with perspective cameras, where scale-space is defined as convolution with a Gaussian. The contribution of this work is a method suitable for use with wide angle cameras. Given an input image, we map it to the unit sphere and obtain scale-space images by convolution with the solution of the spherical diffusion equation on the sphere which we implement in the spherical Fourier domain. Using such an approach, the scale-space response of a point in space is independent of its position on the image plane for a camera subject to pure rotation. Scale-invariant features are then found as local extrema in scale-space. Given this set of scale-invariant features, we then generate feature descriptors by considering a circular support region defined on the sphere whose size is selected relative to the feature scale. We compare our method to a naive implementation of SIFT where the image is treated as perspective, where our results show an improvement in matching performance.",

        "abstract": "This paper describes efficient utilization of human time by two means: prioritization of human tasks and maximizing multirobot team size. We propose an efficient scheduling algorithm for multirobot supervisory control that helps complete a mission faster. The proposed algorithm is superior to existing algorithms by prioritizing human tasks such that robots can regain autonomous control sooner. In simulations of a multirobot area surveying problem, we show that the rate of area coverage is much higher using our algorithm compared to first-in-first-out. We also show that the use of different scheduling algorithms can affect the maximum number of robots a human can manage on a team. Another significant finding related to maximum team size is that the size is always the same or higher than an often-cited estimate known as fan-out [5]. Since fan-out is derived from an ideal, average case, simulations show that the upper bound on team size is higher than that predicted by the fan-out equation. Fan-out is actually a lower bound on the maximum team size for any practical situation (i.e., where task lengths and periodicity may vary or when robots are heterogeneous).",

Despite using the same placement machine, the efficiency of the schedule results in major different assembly time. Therefore, it is important to optimize the scheduling of component mounting. There are three major problems of the scheduling: (1) component feeder location (affects efficiency of pickup operation), (2) mounting sequencing (affects total distance of the mounting tour) , and (3) simultaneous pickup (affects efficiency of pickup operation). To solve these problems, this paper proposes the following approaches. We solve (1) and (3) in a heuristic way by using a random multi-start local search. We solve (2) greedily with putting the result of the feeder array to effective use. The effectiveness of the proposed method was shown through simulations.",

To enable this vision, we need a common communication and cooperation model that can be shared between robotic devices at different scales, ranging from standard mobile robots to tiny embedded devices. Unfortunately, today's robot middlewares are too heavy to run on tiny devices, and middlewares for embedded devices are too simple to support the cooperation models needed by an autonomous smart environment. In this paper, we propose a middleware model which allows the seamless integration of standard robots and simple off-the-shelf embedded devices. Our middleware is suitable for building truly ubiquitous robotics applications, in which devices of very different scales and capabilities can cooperate in a uniform way. We discuss the principles and implementation of our middleware, and show an experiment in which a mobile robot, a commercial mote, and a custom-built mote cooperate in a home service scenario.",

This paper presents a neural oscillator network for the generation of periodic locomotion patterns adapting to changes in the slope of the terrain. Specifically, locomotion trajectories of individual limbs are predetermined in the trajectory generator as a periodic function of the gait. The phase of the periodic function is coordinated with the output of the neural oscillator network incorporating sensory signals detecting the state of the foot in contact with the unknown changing terrain. For stability to be maintained, the neural oscillator plays an important role by controlling the trajectory of the COM in phase with the trajectory of the ZMP. In order to verify the validity of the proposed scheme, we carry out simulations and experiments. A preliminary investigation has yielded promising results, indicating that it may be applied to humanoid locomotion through uneven and uncertain terrain.",

Then, we prove the stability of motion synchronization with the topology control based on Lyapunov exponent.

The approach is perfectly suited for mobile robots equipped with a camera because bearings can be extracted from images with high accuracy. In contrast to existing approaches, our method does not need any internal representation of the robot's position which is updated by alternating motion and sensor updates. In our approach the location is calculated by applying constraints on the robot's position which are derived from the observations and performed actions that are stored in a short-term memory. We give a detailed description of the method and analyze the properties of different observation selection mechanisms. Results of experiments done in simulation and conducted on a Sony Aibo robot are presented in this paper demonstrating the precision of the method.",

        "abstract": "This paper presents a new approach to the intralocalization among a team of robots working in constrained 3D space of urban environments. As the base formation, a team of three ground robots and one wall-climbing robot are deployed on ground and on a wall or ceiling, respectively. The three ground robots localize themselves using an existing panoramic vision-based method. However, no existing method can uniquely determine the pose of the climbing robot based on the positions of three ground robots in its image and in the world coordinate systems; up to four valid solutions could exist using known algorithms, although only one is genuine. By carefully examining these methods, two new algorithms for uniquely locating the climbing robot are proposed. The first algorithm makes use of the straight line constraint of robot motion and can uniquely determine the pose of climbing robot by moving the climbing robot straightly for two small steps. The second algorithm is based on the principle of Bayesian filter and take advantage of the motion sensor readings to loose the straight line constraint. The algorithm could continuously determine the climbing robot\u2019s pose after the initial pose is obtained. Extensive simulations are conducted to validate the soundness and robustness of our algorithms. Preliminary experiments are also carried out to examine the feasibility in applying these algorithms in real robot applications.",

This requires robust and scalable control algorithms that can form a wide range of user-specified shapes, including shapes that adapt to the environment. Here we present a decentralized algorithm for self-organizing of environmentally-adaptive shapes. We apply it to a chain-style modular robot, configured to form a flexible sheet structure. We show that the proposed algorithm is capable of achieving a wide class of environmentally-adaptive shapes, and the module control is simple, scalable, robust and provably correct. The algorithm is also self-maintaining: the shape automatically adapts if the environment changes. Finally, we present several applications which can be achieved within this framework via robot prototypes and simulations, such as a self-balancing table. In our experiments, we demonstrate the algorithm is highly responsive and robust in the face of real-world actuation and sensing noise.",

        "abstract": "This paper proposes a distributed control mechanism for a self-propelled self-assembling robotic system that allows robots to form specific, connected morphologies. Global morphologies are 'grown' using local visual perception only. The robots in the system do not have access to a blueprint of the global pattern and the algorithmic rules are solely based on what a single robot can see in its immediate surroundings. None of the robots have any predefined position in the final morphology, except for the seed robot that initiates the self-assembly process. Robots that are part of the connected entity indicate where new robots should attach in order to grow the local structure appropriately. The paper demonstrates the efficacy of the mechanism by letting groups of up to 9 real robots self-assemble into four different morphologies: line, star, arrow, and dense.",

        "abstract": "The purpose of our research is to establish a method to facilitate programming of robot's tasks in uncertain environments. First, philosophical consideration is given on 'tasks' and 'motions.' They are terms referring to the same things from different viewpoints. Tasks are related to human's intentions or values while motions are to physics. Motions are the realization of the tasks depending on the given environments. To link tasks and motions, the concept of multiple sensorimotor modes is proposed. A mode is defined as a specified relation between the sensory information and the robot motion, with a terminal condition. The modes are used to describe the tasks as well as to command the robot. We implemented some modes for a robot with a force sensor as functions in the C language and made programs for tasks of clearing tableware and extracting pegs using the modes. The experiments successfully demonstrated the applicability of multi-mode control to tasks in uncertain environments.",

The authors aim at development of a semi-autonomous control system for the crawler robot. In the system, moving direction is specified by an operator at remote place. Joypad (Sony PS2 controller) is used as input devise. For increasing its stability and robustness about change of the environment, its flippers are controlled according to sensor informations which can be obtained in real-time. Concretely, the robot recognizes the environment (upward step or downward step) using its physical model, its postural information, flippers' contact and distance between the body and ground, and controls these flippers. In this movie, we show you performance of our proposed control method using \"Aladdin\".",

We have proposed an online walking control system that generates a dynamically stable motion pattern in short cycles, such as 40 [ms]. The system is capable of reflecting the actual motion status modified by sensor feedback to the pattern generation of the next period so that the long-term stability of the walking is maintained using the dynamic model. We herein propose three categories of adaptation as a framework for realizing robust walking via the short-cycle generation system: 1) absorption of the error of the dynamic model, 2) reactive adaptation to the disturbance, and 3) adjustment of the parameters that are used to generate the walking pattern. Feedback methods for each category are discussed and validated on the full-size humanoid HRP-2.",

        "abstract": "Atomic Force Microscope (AFM) has been used as a manipulation tool for a decade. The problem of lacking real time visual feedback still limits its efficiency and hinders its wide application. Although the model based visual feedback can partly solve this problem, due to the complexity of nano environment, it is difficult to use a model to accurately describe the object\u2019s behavior. The modeling error will give the operator a false feedback and lead to a failed manipulation. In this paper, a strategy for visual feedback error on-line detection and correction is proposed to solve this problem. As the real time force information is a key factor for this strategy, an adaptable end effector is employed to accurately measure the interaction force between the probe and the nano-objects, and the system error is also compensated to improve the accuracy of interaction force measurement. Based on the true real time force information, an extended Kalman filter is developed to online detect whether there is a false feedback. Once a false feedback is detected, an optimal searching pattern is generated to get the real manipulation result in a short time. With the assistance of this strategy, the false visual feedback can be realtime detected and corrected without interrupting manipulation. Complex manipulation task can be finished without being interrupted by a new image scan. Experiments of manipulating nano-particles are performed to verify the effectiveness of this strategy, which demonstrated the improved efficiency of the AFM based nano-assembly system.",

        "abstract": "Reliable recognition of objects is an important capability in order to have agents accomplish and assist in a variety of useful tasks such as search and rescue or office assistance. Numerous approaches attempt to recognize objects based on visual cues alone. However, the same type of object can have very different visual appearances, such as shape, size, pose, color. Although such approaches are widely studied with relative success, the general task of object recognition still remains difficult. In previous work, we introduced MCOR (multiple-cue object recognition), a flexible object recognition approach which can use any multiple cues, whether they are visual cues intrinsic to the object or provided by observation of a human. As part of the framework, weights were provided to reflect the variation in the strength of the association between a particular cue and an object. In this paper, we demonstrate how the probabilistic relational framework used to determine the weights can be used in complex scenarios with numerous objects, cues, and the relationship between them. We develop a simulator that can generate these complex scenarios using cues based on real recognition systems.",

In a first time, we present the main sensors used in those approaches and their behavior in noisy environments. We notice that sensors don't offer the same performance. In MAL approaches, those sensors are used to detect landmarks. This detection process constitutes the first step to locate the vehicle. The second step is a data association phase. In the classical systems, those two steps are separated and we remark they have some difficulties to work in noisy environments. We propose here to process them simultaneously using a focusing method. This last one allows the system to return only the landmarks compatible with what we are looking for. Thus, only the desired landmark is returned by the system. This is achieved by taking into account all features of the searched landmark in the detection process. Some experimentations of automatic vehicle guidance were made in outdoor environment under a strong downpour of hail showing the benefit of the proposed approach.",

        "abstract": "The paper considers the problem of obstacle aided locomotion for snake robots, as taking advantage of obstacles for locomotion is an enabling technique for snake robots to enter challenging environments like earthquaked areas and mines for search and rescue missions. To this end, the paper presents a novel non-smooth (hybrid) 2D mathematical model for snake robots which incorporates that the snake robot can come in contact with external obstacles apart from flat ground. The mathematical model is verified through a back-to-back comparison between numerical simulations and experimental results. It is furthermore shown that the snake robot is able to move forward faster and more robustly by exploiting obstacles, and that the locomotion in this case is not as dependent on the ground surface.",

It first provides a survey of the current state of role- based robotics. Then, it offers specific examples of how roles can enable behavior with a team of heterogeneous robots using the Distributed Field Robot Architecture to integrate with a cognitive agent. The implementation extends the robot persona, previously utilized for allocating resources within a distributed robot team, and constructs a context adapter to allow each robot to assume a role as directed by the cognitive agent.",

We argue that a finer- grained integration provides much more natural human-robot interactions and much more reasonable multitasking.",

A kinematic design is deduced based on the surgical task requirements. Forward and inverse kinematics are derived analytically. As the system is required to position medical probes of varying size and shape, details on the calibration for different probe configurations are provided. The kinematic design of the novel manipulator is compared to an existing stereotactic instrument in terms of kinematic accuracy. Results show that the SASSU systems is less sensitive to translational positioning errors induced by changes in the joint variables.",

However, a snake-like robot is usually equipped with a camera on the head, so the swing of the head is problem. To solve this problem, we propose a control method to stabilize the head of an undulating snake-like robot. In the proposed method, the motion of the neck is controlled to cancel the undulation of the body in order to stabilize the head. In this study, first we derived the formulas for this method, and confirmed the effectiveness by simulation. Then we implemented that control on a real snake-like robot and showed the availability of the proposed method.",

The proposed system does not use the inclination of the terrain. Instead, the system changes walking modes depends on its walking speed. In the downhill terrain, when the walking speed is increased, the stiffness of the ankle in the support phase is controlled so as to brake the increased speed. In the uphill terrain, when the walking speed is decreased, the stiffness of the waist joint is controlled and the desired trajectory for the supported leg is shifted so as not to falls down backward. To validate the efficiency of the proposed system, the stability of walking with the proposed system is examined in the two dimensional dynamics simulation. It is shown that the robot with the proposed system can walk in the more variable rough terrain and with the broader walking speed than without changing the stiffness of the joints.",

        "abstract": "In the presence of communication delays, master- slave teleoperation systems suffer from poor contact stability and sluggish performance. In this paper, a new impedance reflecting force-position (F-P) control architecture is proposed in which the master is in interaction with a local model of environment, thus bypassing the delayed contact force received at the master in a typical F-P controller. The local environment model is updated by the environment model parameters that are identified online at the slave and are transmitted to the master. However, due to the delay in model parameter transmission and the slow transition of the identified parameters at contact, the controller experiences contact oscillations in practice. As a remedy, a laser proximity sensor is employed to predict the collision time between the slave and the environment \"a delay ahead of time\". The incorporation of predicted contact time not only synchronizes the required sudden change in the environment local model dynamics with the remote environment contact event, but also allows for an increase in parameter identification convergence rate. The prediction method is introduced for slave unrestricted motion; however, it is verified on a single degree-of-freedom experimental setup. The performance of the proposed novel impedance reflecting F-P controller with collision prediction is compared to that of a typical F-P controller.",

        "abstract": "Robust vision-based grasping is still a hard problem for humanoid robot systems. When being restricted to using the camera system built-in into the robot\u2019s head for object localization, the scenarios get often very simplified in order to allow the robot to grasp autonomously. Within the computer vision community, many object recognition and localization systems exist, but in general, they are not tailored to the application on a humanoid robot. In particular, accurate 6D object localization in the camera coordinate system with respect to a 3D rigid model is crucial for a general framework for grasping. While many approaches try to avoid the use of stereo calibration, we will present a system that makes explicit use of the stereo camera system in order to achieve maximum depth accuracy. Our system can deal with textured objects as well as objects that can be segmented globally and are defined by their shape. Thus, it covers the cases of objects with complex texture and complex shape. Our work is directly linked to a grasping framework being implemented on the humanoid robot ARMAR and serves as its perception module for various grasping and manipulation experiments in a kitchen scenario.",

We propose a new concept named \"bridle drive\", that was developed from the prototype model of the units of the SSR-2.3 that has units of the bridle bellows composed of a large caliber bellows and wire lock systems. The use of the bellows allows to produce a high output using air pressure, and its shape can be changed by controlling the length of the wires. In this paper, to solve problems of the previous model of the bridle bellows, we modified its brake systems and propose a new control method named PCBS.",

The system consists of a Data Glove as a master device, as well as slave controllers and a slave robot. The feedback loop of the slave system is closed at the slave side so that the slave controllers manipulate an object stably following commands from a Data Glove. A Data Glove usually extracts a subject's hand shape in order to map it to a slave hand. However, the proposed method only extracts a few key pieces of information which slave controllers require. We explain the proposed system and propose a way to extract the key information with a Data Glove. An experiment is executed to validate the proposed method.",

The manipulator system consists of two five-bar linkage mechanisms, an optical tracking device, and a user interface of surgical navigation. We designed and fabricated a prototype manipulator and evaluated the performance of the system by a set of experiments. The accuracy evaluation showed that the average backlash of the 4 link axes was 4.14\u00b0 and the accuracy of the pitch and yaw angle of the K-wire are 1.55\u00b0 \u00b1 2.74\u00b0 and \u22122.48\u00b0 \u00b1 2.92\u00b0. This system enables intrinsic safety and ease of sterilization due to limitations in the range of movement. Furthermore, the system achieves reliability because of the simplicity of both its mechanism and its user interface. The manipulator has the potential to be used in minimally invasive ACL reconstruction surgery, although further improvements and experiments remain to be carried out.",

In order to deal with this problem, we propose a new methodology, which derives immediately from the acceleration compensation principle[1]. It consists basically of modifying the original reference-trajectory comprised by a set of suspension points, with the purpose to compensate undesirable residual swing effects at the end of the transfer motion. This open-loop method is computationally simple, time-efficient and feasible. In contrast to the popular methods utilized to control the overhead cranes, which traveling motions are restricted only in the horizontal plane, our compensation technique involves as well the motion in vertical plane. The rope length is assumed invariant. A set of simulations and experimental verifications using an industrial robot manipulator KUKA KR 16 have been carried out to demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed solution.",

The energy interaction exists between the gymnast and the high bar, because the high bar is bending during gymnastics. Therefore, more efficient motion would be constructed by controlling this energy interaction. Based on this probability, swing up control which considers the compliance and the energy interaction with each component is proposed. To confirm this discussion, an experiment using the acrobot is carried out, and the advantage and the disadvantage by using compliance are examined by comparing experimental results for with and without compliance case.",

Although change of activation of a muscle affects whole body motion, such synergy is supposed to play a great role for realizing stable walking. This paper investigates synergistic 3D limit cycle walking of an anthropomorphic biped robot whose joints are driven by artificial pneumatic muscles antagonistically. Since its walking emerges from the synergy, we cannot design the desired trajectory in a top-down manner, but can change an activation pattern of the muscles and figure out appropriate parameters for stable walking. We experimentally demonstrate that the biped walks stably with a simple limit cycle controller. This is the pioneering work for investigating synergistic stable walking of a whole body humanoid.",

We present a concept for synchronization and communication which tackles these challenges in multi-sensor systems in a unified manner. Here, a combination of hardware synchronization and deterministic software signals is promoted for global synchronization. Patterns of event-driven communication ensure that sensor data processing and evaluation are not bound to runtime constraints induced by data acquisition anymore. The combination of unified range and pose data description, event-driven communication, and global synchronization allows to build 3D sensing applications for various tasks. The proposed concept is implemented and evaluated for a variety of applications based on the DLR multisensory 3D-modeller. Extendability to other range and pose sensors is straightforward.",

        "abstract": "This paper presents a study which ex- tends previous work on collective motion control of a group of vehicles for target tracking. The approach is to drive the group centroid to follow a moving target while keeping all vehicles near the centroid. The provided analysis shows that the system is sta- ble. However, the tracking performance is sensitive to imperfect communication and steering dynamics. Simulation results show the performance degrades significantly when delays and steering dynamics are present. An analysis is provided to identify a major cause of the performance degradation. An alternative control law is proposed in the paper. Comparisons of the simulation results show the improved performance of the new control law.",

This paper describes a representation of constrained motion for joint space planners and develops two simple and efficient methods for constrained sampling of joint configurations: Tangent Space Sampling (TS) and First-Order Retraction (FR). Constrained joint space planning is important for many real world problems involving redundant manipulators. On the one hand, tasks are designated in work space coordinates: rotating doors about fixed axes, sliding drawers along fixed trajectories or holding objects level during transport. On the other, joint space planning gives alternative paths that use redundant degrees of freedom to avoid obstacles or satisfy additional goals while performing a task. In simulation, we demonstrate that our methods are faster and significantly more invariant to problem/algorithm parameters than existing techniques.",

Two evaluation tasks were performed by participants using manual MIS instruments and this teleoperated robotic surgical system. The task data were analyzed and compared between the manual and robot instrument operation. The results show that compared with typical manual instrument operation, the teleoperated robotic system in this paper has advantages in ease of use, decreased task time, and better accuracy with smooth motions and less tremor.",

The center of gravity (COG) and foot of the swing leg are treated as task space control points. Floating base inverse kinematics with constraints is employed, thereby allowing for a mobile platform suitable for locomotion. Different techniques of task prioritization are discussed and we clarify differences and similarities of previous suggested work. Varying levels of prioritization for control are examined with emphasis on singularity robustness and the negative effects of constraint switching. A novel controller for task space control of balance and locomotion is developed which attempts to address singularity robustness, while minimizing discontinuities created by constraint switching. Controllers are evaluated using a quadruped robot simulator engaging in a locomotion task.",

Typically, the symmetries that one exploits are intrinsic to the mechanical system at hand, e.g. invariance of the system's Lagrangian to some group of motions. In the present work we consider symmetries that arise from an extrinsic control task, rather than the intrinsic structure of configuration space, constraints, or system dynamics. We illustrate this technique with several examples. In the examples, the reduction enables us to design essentially global feedback controllers on the reduced systems. We apply task-induced symmetry and reduction to a recently developed 6 DOF kinematic model of steerable bevel-tip needles. The resulting controllers cause the needle tip to track a subspace of its configuration space. We envision that the methodology presented in this paper will form the basis for a new planning and control framework for needle steering.",

Furthermore, it is often desirable that tasks be learned quickly without having to provide multiple demonstrations. Training should also be conducted in such a way that the user has a clear understanding of the manner in which environmental features affect the behavior of the learned activity, so that execution behavior is predictable. We present an interactive framework for teaching a robot the flow of an activity composed of elements from a set of primitive behaviors and previously trained activities. Conditional branching and looping, order-independent activity execution, and contingency (or interrupt) actions can all be captured by our activity structures. Additional convenience functionality to aid in the training process is also provided. By providing a natural method of communicating production rules analogous to rigid programming structures, well-defined tasks can be trained easily. We demonstrate our task training procedure on a mobile robot.",

When we observed structured dance motion performed at a normal music playback speed and motion performed at a faster music playback speed, we found that the detail of each motion is slightly different while the whole of the dance motion is similar in both cases. This phenomenon is derived from the fact that dancers omit the details and perform the essential part of the dance in order to follow the faster speed of the music. To clarify this phenomenon, we analyzed the motion differences in the frequency domain, and obtained two insights on the omission of motion details: (1) High frequency components are gradually attenuated depending on the musical speed, and (2) important stop motions are preserved even when high frequency components are attenuated. Based on these insights, we modeled our motion modification considering musical speed and joint limitations that a humanoid robot has. We show the effectiveness of our method via some applications for humanoid robot motion generation.",

Recognition of human body movements is getting larger interests in robotic research field, since robots must recognize human behavior in order to interact with human in the real world. In addition, there is demand for quantitative methods to analyze human body movements, since human body movements can be used as models of robot behaviors. The author proposes a scheme for human behavior recognition based on two process steps: analysis of movement correlations among limbs and temporal segmentation of motion data. Inter-limb movement correlations are widely observed in various behaviors and well represent contents of behavior, so it will be a universal feature value for general behavior. Observing changes of inter-limb correlations, we can segment motion capture data into temporal fragment of action units. Using this segmentation technique in an experiment, the system succeeded recognizing various types of human behavior efficiently.",

During training, the system identifies a set of image chips (or exemplars) that span the range of terrain appearance. Each chip is assigned a vector tag of vehicle-terrain interaction characteristics that are obtained from on-board sensors and simple performance models, as the vehicle traverses the terrain. The system uses the exemplars to segment images into regions, based on visual similarity to the terrain patches observed during training, and assigns the appropriate vehicle-terrain interaction tag to them. This methodology will therefore allow the online forecasting of vehicle performance on upcoming terrain. Currently, we are using fuzzy c-means clustering and exploring a number of different features for characterizing the visual appearance of the terrain.",

        "abstract": "For the collaborative control of a team of robots, a set of well-suited high-level control algorithms, especially for path planning and measurement scheduling, is essential. The quality of these control algorithms can be significantly increased by considering uncertainties that arise, e.g. from noisy measurements or system model abstraction, by incorporating stochastic filters into the control. To develop these kinds of algorithms and to prove their effectiveness, obviously real- world experiments with real world uncertainties are mandatory. Therefore, a test-environment for evaluating algorithms for collaborative control of a team of robots is presented. This test-environment is founded on miniature walking robots with six degrees of freedom. Their novel locomotion concept not only allows them to move in a wide variety of different motion patterns far beyond the possibilities of traditionally employed wheel-based robots, but also to handle real-world conditions like uneven ground or small obstacles. These robots are embedded in a modular test-environment, comprising infrastructure and simulation modules as well as a high-level control module with submodules for pose estimation, path planning, and measurement scheduling. The interaction of the individual modules of the introduced test-environment is illustrated by an experiment from the field of cooperative localization with focus on measurement scheduling, where the robots that perform distance measurements are selected based on a novel criterion, the normalized mutual Mahalanobis distance.",

Whereas an intelligent system - possibly controlled by a human supervisor - is able to integrate the information originating from different sources (i.e., fixed devices and sensors distributed throughout the environment) and to coordinate their behaviors in case of anomalies, the mobile robot is a significant part of the overall system: its main subsystems, i.e., autonomous surveillance, localization (performed using only a non-differential GPS and a laser rangefinder) and navigation are investigated in depth. Experimental results validate the robustness and reliability of the approach.",

        "abstract": "This paper proposes a novel nonlinear viscoelastic soft tissue model generated from ex vivo experimental results on ovine liver using a force sensitive probe. In order to study the biomechanics of soft tissue, static indentation tests were applied on ovine liver. An empirical constitutive equation was extracted from the examined data. A mechanical model combining linear viscoelasticity with a nonlinear function of strain-stress is proposed. The developed model has been evaluated both statically and dynamically with different strain rates - i.e. where the velocity of indentation is varied. By comparing simulation results and measured experimental data, it has been concluded that the proposed model is robust for modelling both static and dynamic indentation conditions. The effect of changing boundary conditions on the parameters in the proposed model has been studied by choosing test sites with different underlying tissue thicknesses. The results indicate that for small strain, the effect of the thickness condition is reasonable to be neglected.",

We provide a formal definition of the problem and we investigate its basic theoretical properties, showing that the problem is NP-complete. We then present an algorithm to compute a strategy for the restriction of the problem to trees and present a method how to use this solution in applications. The method is then tested in simple simulations. GRAPH-CLEAR is useful to describe multirobot pursuit evasion games when robots have limited sensing capabilities, i.e. multiple agents are needed to perform basic patrolling operations.",

In contrast, it is difficult to control the shoulder structure because it have multiple degrees of freedom and extraordinary physical constraints. An aim of our research is to create a repeatable motion generation system of the bladebone-collarbone structures for real musculo-skeletal humanoid robots. In this paper, we describe the design process of the bladebone-collarbone structures for a muscle-driven humanoid robot, and the simulation system considering geometrical constraints of the structures. Then, we show a motion experiment using the shoulder structures of the humanoid, based on the simulation system we presented.",

        "abstract": "In this research, we focused on the coordination functions of joint motions, which are necessary for the generation of the dynamic stability of the motor control. This coordination had not been dealt until now, and we reviewed the design principle of the support technology which may improve this coordination ability. Concretely, as the new experimental paradigm, we applied the para-hemiplegic patients wearing the orthosis which restricts the joints of the upper and lower limbs, and we measured the gait training process with the constant RAS (Rhythmic Auditory Stimulation) cueing. Then we analyzed the rhythmic and trajectory characteristics in the rhythmic pattern of the leg motion. As the results, it came out that the rhythmic characteristic is restructured as the unstable series which is susceptible to the external environment in this gait training method. On the other hand, it came out that the trajectory characteristic had an improvement process which involves the historical quality about 1 minute. This result indicated that the trajectory characteristic is restructured as the series which is less subject to the external environment. Now therefore, it was indicated that the one-sided stimulus presentation like RAS is inadequate to improve the rhythmic characteristics, and to support both characteristics technologically, the interactive training which is able to control the auditory stimulus presentation according to patient\u2019s gait state is necessary.",

        "abstract": "In applications such as space and surgical robotics, the use of thin, lightweight manipulators and cable-driven end- effectors results in flexibility of the manipulator. In bilateral teleoperation, however, any flexibility in a link or joint of the robot reduces the transparency of teleoperation. In this paper, we analyze master-slave teleoperation transparency under slave robot joint elasticity and evaluate the added benefits of using extra sensors at the end-effector of the elastic-joint robot. It is shown that velocity (or position) feedback from the output shaft of the elastic joint improves free-space position tracking performance, which in the absence of such feedback is hampered by the joint's anti-resonance. Also, when the interaction forces with an environment are measured by a force sensor and fed back to the user, end-effector velocity feedback improves hard-contact force tracking performance. If the operating trajectories correspond to low frequencies, both free-space position tracking and hard-contact force tracking are satisfactory regardless of end-effector feedback, yet the elasticity in the joint will be transmitted to the user during a hard contact task unless end-effector velocity feedback is used.",

The use of shape functions to define a set of irregularly shaped elements allows the target PDF to be continuously, and thus accurately, represented over the target space. A comparison with the grid-based method first shows that the element-based method requires less than 10% of the number of nodes to achieve the same accuracy. The application of the element-based method to marine search-and-rescue (SAR) scenarios then demonstrates its ability for effective SAR whilst maintaining collected information.",

        "abstract": "Insects of the order Diptera have evolved to become prolific flyers able to perform aerial maneuvers that far surpass anything man-made. The Harvard Micro robotics lab has recently demonstrated the first step towards recreating these evolutionary wonders with the world's first demonstration of an at-scale robotic insect capable of generating sufficient thrust to takeoff (with external power). The mechanics and aerodynamics of this device are quite similar to Dipteran insects. Biologists have recently quantified the complex nonlinear temporal phenomena that give insects their outstanding capabilities. Periodic wing motions consisting of a large stroke and pronation and supination about an axis parallel to the span-wise direction are characteristic of most hovering Dipteran insects. Previous microrobot designs have attempted to concisely control each wing trajectory in these two dimensions. The robot that is shown here has three degrees-of- freedom, only one of which is actuated. Here, a central power actuator drives the wing with as large a stroke as possible and passive dynamics allow the wing to rotate using flexural elements with joint stops to avoid over-rotation. There are four primary components to the mechanical system: the actuator (or 'flight muscle'), transmission (or 'thorax'), airframe (or 'exoskeleton') and the wings. Each is constructed using a meso- scale manufacturing paradigm called Smart Composite Microstructures. This entails the use of laminated laser-micromachined materials stacked to achieve a desired compliance profile. This prototyping method is inexpensive, conceptually simple, and fast: for example, all components of the fly can be created in less than one week. Additionally, the resulting structures perform favorably when compared to alternative devices: flexure joints have almost no loss, ultra-high modulus links have higher stiffness-to-weight than any other material, and the piezoelectric actuators have similar power density to the best ...

        "abstract": "As a result from our research, the Waseda Flutist Robot is able of playing the flute nearly similar to an intermediate level flutist. In order to enhance the expressiveness of its performance, we are focusing our research on improving the mechanical design of the simulated organs as well as implementing automated algorithms for the generation of expressive music performance. In a previous research, we have developed a human-like vocal cord to improve the production of vibrato. In this paper, we are presenting the newest version of the flutist robot; where the lips, oral cavity and tonguing mechanisms were improved. Such improvements were proposed to effectively control the attack time and double tonguing. The attack time is useful to produce clear sounds and the double tonguing is an important articulation that helps players to produce shaped notes and smooth transitions between notes. The lips mechanism is composed by 3-DOFs which enables the accurate control of the air stream parameters (width, thickness and angle). The lips of the robot were designed more human-like by using a thermoplastic rubber (septon). The oral cavity was designed similar to the human one also made by septon. Inside the oral cavity, an improved tonguing mechanism was designed (1-DOF) to reproduce better the double tonguing technique. A set of experiments were performed to analyze the improvements on the dynamical properties of the sound while playing the flute.",

The compact image representation allows us to create image collections containing millions of images, which enables mapping of very large environments.

        "abstract": "Accurate torque control of a brushless motor requires the motor\u2019s torque characteristics, which can be captured by a periodic function in motor angle. This paper presents a direct adaptive controller for torque control of brushless motors, which estimates the Fourier coefficients of the periodic function based on the measurements of motor phase voltage and angle. It will be analytically shown that the proposed adaptive controller achieves torque tracking regardless of the trajectories of input signals. Moreover, the adaptive controller does not rely on the modeling of the mechanical load, and that makes control implementation simple and modular. Experimental results obtained from the McGill/MIT motor have demonstrated that motor torque converges to the command torque.",

        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "Accurate load sensing is increasingly important in performing various tasks involved with contacting the environment. Most research has been focused on improving the hardware of a force/torque sensor. Torque sensors for a manipulator suffer from crosstalk, which cannot be compensated even by calibration. Thus they require precise machining and complicated structure to minimize crosstalk, which often results in cost increase. This research proposes a new calibration method composed of two steps. By the primary calibration, the torque sensor output can be related to the joint torques. The secondary calibration, which is based on the virtual load, is conducted to compensate crosstalk of the torque sensor. The virtual load is obtained from the measured joint torques and the manipulator configuration. Using the proposed calibration method, the external load acting on the end-effector can be sensed accurately even with relatively low-quality torque sensors. Experimental results showed that the error in load sensing was significantly reduced by the proposed calibration method.",

The models enable the recognition of the objects in cluttered scenes and the classification of newly encountered objects. Key technical contributions include (1) a robust, accurate, and efficient algorithm for constructing complete object mod els from 3D point clouds constituting partial object views, (2) feature-based recognition procedures for cabinets, tables, and other task-relevant furniture objects, and (3) automatic inference of object instance and class signatures for objects of dally use that enable robots to reliably recognize the objects in cluttered and real task contexts.

The design of this mobile haptic interface is based on a modular system consisting of two components: two haptic interfaces and a mobile platform. This work mainly addresses the design and control concepts of the haptic interfaces, which are planned to be mounted on the mobile platform. The interfaces dispose of a large workspace and a high force/torque capability. The design and control concepts of these new interfaces enable a decoupling of translational from rotational movements. Such a decoupling helps to simplify significantly the control algorithms which take care of the interaction between mobile platform and haptic interfaces. Evaluation results concerning the Cartesian position tracking performance and the impedance display fidelity provide an insight into the performance of the developed system.",

        "abstract": "Safety is a critical success factor for consumer acceptance of domestic robotic products. Some researchers have adopted the head injury criterion (HIC) as absolute safety norm. However, this norm covers only part of the safety risk. In many cases skin damage (e.g. cuts, wounds, etc) can be a more serious risk. This article shows how to work towards a novel absolute safety measure for evaluating the shape and material choices of a robotic design w.r.t. skin damage. The proposed safety norm evaluates the situation of an unintended uncontrolled collision of a robotic part against a human. Maximum curvatures of the exterior robotic shape are approximated as a sphere in contact with the human skin (locally approximated as a flat surface). This local spheric approximation of the impact contact is used to predict maximum tensile stress during impact of the robotic part on the human. Robotic designs that include points for which the tensile strength of the skin is exceeded will cause at least skin fracture and are therefore considered intrinsically unsafe. While in general applicable, this paper specifically addresses how to apply the proposed norm in the case of safety evaluation of robotic manipulators.",

        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "Compliant control will be a prerequisite for humanoid robotics if these robots are supposed to work safely and robustly in human and/or dynamic environments. One view of compliant control is that a robot should control a minimal number of degrees-of-freedom (DOFs) directly, i.e., those relevant DOFs for the task, and keep the remaining DOFs maximally compliant, usually in the null space of the task. This view naturally leads to task space control. However, surprisingly few implementations of task space control can be found in actual humanoid robots. This paper makes a first step towards assessing the usefulness of task space controllers for humanoids by investigating which choices of controllers are available and what inherent control characteristics they have - this treatment will concern position and orientation control, where the latter is based on a quaternion formulation. Empirical evaluations on an anthropomorphic Sarcos master arm illustrate the robustness of the different controllers as well as the ease of implementing and tuning them. Our extensive empirical results demonstrate that simpler task space controllers, e.g., classical resolved motion rate control or resolved acceleration control can be quite advantageous in face of inevitable modeling errors in model- based control, and that well chosen formulations are easy to implement and quite robust, such that they are useful for humanoids.",

Intersections are complex to deal with due to the presence of large number of vehicle and pedestrian activities, and possible occlusions. Information available from only the sensors onboard a vehicle has limited value in this scenario. In this paper, we propose to utilize sensors on-board the vehicle of interest as well as the sensors that are mounted on nearby vehicles to enhance the driver situation awareness. The resulting major research challenge of sensor registration with moving observers is solved using a mutual information based technique. The response of the sensors to common causes are identified and exploited for computing their unknown relative locations. Experimental results, for a mock up traffic intersection in which mobile robots equipped with laser range finders are used, are presented to demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed technique.",

        "abstract": "This paper presents the performance of a needle insertion teleoperated system with haptic feedback. Through a haptic device, the surgeon tele-operates the surgical needle, fixed on the remote robot that may evolve in free space or in contact. In free space, the surgeon feels the motion of the robot. During the needle insertion, the puncture of the tissue involves an abrupt and large change in the magnitude of the applied force. To perform and improve the tele-operated task, an on-line transparency improvement is achieved using the environment stiffness estimation. The transparency is improved based on the stability of the haptic feedback teleoperation scheme in which we distinguish between the voluntary and involuntary operator position. The quality of telepresence allows the surgeon to perform and exactly characterize the needle insertion phases without using additional transition detection techniques. To assess the proposed teleoperation scheme, a surgical needle rigidly attached to the robot and ex-vivo tissues are used.",

        "abstract": "This paper considers the problem of model based control of the joints of a snake robot without wheels. The potential range of applications for snake robots are numerous, and delicate operations such as inspection and maintenance in industrial environments or performing search and rescue operations require precise control of a snake robot joints. To this end we present a controller that asymptotically stabilizes the joints of the snake robot to a desired reference trajectory. The controller is based on input-output linearization of a control plant model of the snake robot dynamics also developed in this paper. In addition, we provide a formal Lyapunov-based proof of the closed-loop stability, together with simulation results for a smooth dynamical model. Finally, the performance of the controller is tested on a non-smooth snake robot model with set-valued Coulomb friction that offers an accurate description of the stick-slip transitions during locomotion.",

        "abstract": "Intention recognition is an important topic in human-robot cooperation that can be tackled using probabilistic model-based methods. A popular instance of such methods are Bayesian networks where the dependencies between random variables are modeled by means of a directed graph. Bayesian networks are very efficient for treating networks with conditionally independent parts. Unfortunately, such independence sometimes has to be constructed by introducing so called hidden variables with an intractably large state space. An example are human actions which depend on human intentions and on other human actions. Our goal in this paper is to find models for intention-action mapping with a reduced state space in order to allow for tractable on-line evaluation. We present a systematic derivation of the reduced model and experimental results of recognizing the intention of a real human in a virtual environment.",

        "abstract": "On this paper, inertial orientation measurements are exploited to compensate the rotational degrees of freedom for an aerial vehicle carrying a perspective camera, taking a sequence of images of the ground plane. It is known that, on the pure translation case, full homographies are reduced to planar homologies, and the relative scene depth of two points equals the reciprocal ratio of their image distances to the the FOE. The first part of this paper covers trajectory recovery for an airship carrying a perspective camera taking a sequence of images of the ground plane, as a series of relative poses between successive camera poses. This is commonly named \u201cVisual Odometry\u201c. Previous results showed that the ratio of heights over the ground plane on two views can be calculated more accurately, and thus the altitude component of the trajectory, and here these results are extended by recovering the full 3D camera trajectory. In the second part, the same rotation-compensated imagery is exploited on the mapping domain: from pixel correspondences between successive images the height of points over the ground plane can be recovered, and placed on a DEM grid, performing 3D mapping from monocular aerial images. These results may be useful on the SLAM context.",

Representing the libraries in a feature-based space is key to supporting transfer. We also search through the library to ensure a complete path to the goal is possible.

        "abstract": "Robot navigation in complex outdoor terrain can benefit from accurate traversability classification. Appearancebased traversability estimation can provide a long-range sensing capability which complements the traditional use of stereo or LIDAR ranging. In the standard approach to traversability classification, each image frame is decomposed into patches or pixels for further analysis. However, classification at the pixel level is prone to noise and complicates the task of identifying homogeneous regions for navigation. Fixed-sized patches aggregate pixel information, resulting in better noise properties, but they can span multiple distinct image regions, which can degrade the classification performance and make thin obstacles difficult to detect. We address the use of superpixels as the visual primitives for traversability estimation. Superpixels are obtained from an over-segmentation of the image and they aggregate visually homogeneous pixels while respecting natural terrain boundaries. We show that superpixels are superior to patches in classification accuracy and result in more effective navigation in complex terrain environments. Our experimental results include a study of the effect of patch and superpixel size on classification accuracy. We demonstrate that superpixels can be computed on-line on a real robot at a sufficient frame rate to support long-range sensing and planning.",

The goal of this paper' is to develop methods for quantifying the difficulty a robot would encounter traversing such a region of rough terrain. Towards this, three traversability metrics describing rough terrain robot mobility are developed. In order to simplify the problem, we assume that the rough terrain in question can be discretized in a certain manner and then develop the metrics for this discretized version of the terrain. Two of the developed metrics reflect the difficulty a robot would have trying to move over the entire region of terrain (referred to as coverability). The third metric, referred to as crossability, describes the difficulty a robot would encounter attempting to move from some fixed point on the terrain to some other fixed point. We verify the applicability of the developed metrics using NIST-developed repeatable test methods (step fields) and discuss the validity of the obtained results.",

        "abstract": "Electromagnetic interference (EMI) between magnetic resonance (MR) imager and surgical manipulator is a severe problem, that degrades the image quality, in MR image- guided surgical robotic systems. We propose a novel motor driving method to acquire noise-free image. Noise generation accompanied by motor actuation is permitted only during the \"dead time\" when the MR imager stops signal acquisition to wait for relaxation of protons. For the synchronized control between MR imager and motor driving system, we adopted a radio-frequency pulse signal detected by a special antenna as a synchronous trigger. This method can be applied widely because it only senses a part of the scanning signal and requires neither hardware nor software changes to the MR imager. The evaluation results showed the feasibility of RF pulse as a synchronous trigger and the availability of sequence-based noise reduction method.",

The lithotripsy crushes kidney stones powder, therefore, do not harm to the surrounding tissues of the kidney stones. However, it is necessary to continuously emit high intensity ultrasound waves on a target kidney stone during treatment. Therefore, HIFU transducers should follow a target kidney stone which moves due to respiration and heartbeat. In this paper, ultrasound-based visual servoing system is described. Two ultrasound probes and a HIFU transducer are mounted on the end effector of a xyz stage machine. The two ultrasound probes visually keep track of the target kidney stone within the body, and servo the xyz stage machine. The required techniques, such as conversion of a frame of radio frequency (RF) echo signals into an ultrasound bright mode image, visual tracking, pose estimation and control, are explained.",

Catadioptric cameras with a unique viewpoint are of primary interest, among these is the case where the reflective surface is a parabolic mirror and the camera satisfies the orthographic projection model and which we call paracatadioptric. We here present a new geometrical property (called disparity-circles property) for paracatadioptric cameras and use it to design a video compass algorithm that can compute the 1-axis rotation angle between two views of at least two parallel lines, without any need of internal camera calibration parameters. We present a linear closed form solution suitable for real-time implementation. We then study the performances of our algorithm, its sensitivity to image noise and propose also experimental results with a paracatadioptric camera mounted on a mobile robotic platform.",

A mechanical scanning imaging sonar is used to obtain information about the location of planar structures present in such environments. A modified version of the Hough transform has been developed to extract line features, together with their uncertainty, from the continuous sonar datafiow. The information obtained is incorporated into a feature-based SLAM algorithm running an Extended Kalman Filter (EKF). Simultaneously, the AUV\u2019s position estimate is provided to the feature extraction algorithm to correct the distortions that the vehicle motion produces in the acoustic images. Experiments carried out in a marina located in the Costa Brava (Spain) with the Ictineu AUV show the viability of the proposed approach.",

        "abstract": "This paper describes how to compensate unknown external forces caused by a rider's motion of a biped walking vehicle. When external forces act on a robot's waist, the waist is accelerated so that a measured ZMP may be equal to a reference ZMP. To inhibit the divergence of the waist motion, the reference ZMP is varied inside a support polygon. However, if a large external force acts on a robot, the waist trajectory does not converge by only controlling a reference ZMP. So, ZMP trajectory is varied by changing a foot-landing point. Using the proposed control method, WL-16RIV (Waseda Leg-No. 16 Refined IV) achieved a stable human-carrying walking under unknown external forces which exert forward and sideways on the robot's waist. Through various walking experiments, the effectiveness of the proposed method was confirmed.",

        "abstract": "This paper presents mobile robot localization using coded infrared light as artificial landmarks. Different from RFID, identification using infrared light has highly deterministic characteristics. IRID(infrared identification) is implemented with IR LEDs and photo transistors. By putting several infrared LEDs on the ceiling, the floor is divided into several sectors and each sector is set to have a unique identification. The coded infrared light tells which sector the robot is in, but the size of the uncertainty is still too large if the sector size is large, which usually occur. Dead-reckoning provides the estimated robot configuration but the error is getting accumulated as the robot travels. This paper presents an algorithm which fuses both the encoder and the IRID information so that the size of the uncertainty becomes smaller. It also introduces a framework which can be used with other types of the artificial landmarks. The characteristics of the developed IRID and the proposed algorithm are verified from the experiments.",

        "abstract": "Vehicle guidance in complex scenarios such as inner-city traffic requires an in-depth understanding of the current situation. In order to select the appropriate behavior for an autonomous vehicle, an analysis of the situation is needed. The analysis consists of an estimation of the situation's development with respect to the selected behavior. This can only be done using higher-level reasoning techniques. In this paper, an approach for situation interpretation for autonomous vehicles is presented. The approach relies on case-based reasoning in order to predict the evolvement of the current situation and to select the appropriate behavior. Case-based reasoning allows to utilize prior experiences in the task of situation assessment.",

Additional information - intra-process, spatial, current, and persistent sensor data - is useful to cope with uncertainty, measurement errors, and incompleteness of data. We propose to augment robot world models by using local sensors (which provide data from a local epsiv-environment) and build precise maps from local sensors, with force and audio classification in orthopedics applications with a medical robot system (RONAF) as an example. Improving precision of this map-building is presented both for data localisation and data insertion.",

The robot must then be able to reproduce the task even when unexpected perturbations occur. In this case, it has to learn a new solution.

        "track": "main",
        "status": "Poster",
        "abstract": "Minimally invasive surgery (MIS) has become very common in recent years, thanks to the many advantages it provides for patients. Since it is difficult for surgeons to learn and master this technique, several training methods and metrics have been proposed, both to improve the surgeon's abilities and also to assess his/her skills. This paper presents the use of the WB-1R (Waseda bioinstrumentation system no.1 refined), which was developed at Waseda University, Tokyo, to investigate and analyze a surgeon's movements and performance. Specifically, the system can measure the movements of the head, the arms, and the hands, as well as several physiological parameters. In this paper we present our experiment to evaluate a surgeon's ability to handle surgical instruments and his/her depth perception using a laparoscopic view. Our preliminary analysis of a subset of the acquired data (i.e. comfort of the subjects; the amount of time it took o complete each exercise; and respiration) clearly shows that the expert surgeon and the group of medical students perform very differently. Therefore, WB-1R (or, better, a newer version tailored specifically for use in the operating room) could provide important additional information to help assess the experience and performance of surgeons, thus leading to the development of a global performance index for surgeons during MIS. These analyses and modeling, moreover, are an important step towards the automatization and the robotic assistance of the surgical gesture.",

Task-oriented grasping algorithms are used in order to plan a suitable grasp on the object according to the task to perform.

This work demonstrates a method for generating continuous feedback control inputs that satisfy high-level specifications. Using a collection of continuous local feedback control policies in concert with a synthesized discrete automaton, this paper demonstrates the approach on an Ackermann-steered vehicle that satisfies the command \"drive around until you find an empty parking space, then park.\" The system reacts to changing environmental conditions using only local information, while guaranteeing the correct high level behavior. The local policies consider the vehicle body shape as well as bounds on drive and steering velocities. The discrete automaton that invokes the local policies guarantees executions that satisfy the high-level specification based only on information about the current availability of the nearest parking space. This paper also demonstrates coordination of two vehicles using the approach.",

        "abstract": "This paper considers a tracked vehicle traversing unknown terrain, and proposes an approach based on the Generalized Newton Raphson (GNR) method for identifying all the unknown soil parameters required for tractive force prediction. For the first time, the methodology, based on measurements of track slip, i, and tractive force, F, to find unknown soil parameters is developed. The tractive force is the force generated by a tracked vehicle to drive itself forwards. This tractive force depends to a large extent on certain soil parameters, namely soil cohesion (c), soil internal friction angle (phi), and soil shear deformation modulus (K). Accurately identifying parameters of the soil on which a tracked vehicle is moving will potentially lead to accurate traversability prediction, effective traction control, and precise trajectory tracking. The soil parameter identification algorithm is validated with the experimental data from Wong [3] and from in-house track- terrain interaction test rig showing good identification accuracy and fast execution speed. It is also shown to be relatively robust to initial condition. The identified soil parameters are, in turn, used to predict the tractive forces showing good agreement with all the experimental data. The technique presented in this paper is general and can be applied to any tracked vehicle.",

        "abstract": "In this article, we propose a new observation model combination approach under particle filtering scheme, which allows robust and accurate visual tracking under typ ical circumstances of real-time visual tracking. This scheme stochastically selects single observation model to evaluate the likelihood of some particle. Since only one single observation likelihood is evaluated for any one particle, the time-cost can be reduced dramatically. To verify its performance, this particle filter is used for vehicle tracking, by stochastically selecting color histogram or edge orientation histogram. The accuracy and robustness of the stochastic fusion approach are evaluated using real sequences. Furthermore, we demonstrate through these experiments that the stochastic fusion scheme performs almost as well as the deterministic fusion approach.",

        "abstract": "This paper puts forward an approach for a mobile robot to recognize the human's manipulative actions from different single camera views. While most of the related work in action recognition assume a fixed static camera view that is the same for training and testing, such kind of constraints do not apply for mobile robot companions. We propose a recognition scheme that is able to generalize an action model, that has been learned from a very few data items observed from a single camera view, to variant view points and different settings. We tackle the problem of compensating the view dependence of 2D motion models on three different levels. Firstly, we pre-segment the trajectories based on an object vicinity that depends on the camera tilt and object detections. Secondly, an interactive feature vector is designed that represents the relative movements between the human hand and the objects. Thirdly, we propose an adaptive HMM-based matching process that is based on a particle filter and includes a dynamically adjusted scaling parameter that models the systematic error of the view dependency. Finally, we use a two-layered approach for task recognition which decouples the task knowledge from the view dependent primitive recognition. The results of experiments in an office environment show the applicability of this approach.",

Unlike existing works that track a target to localize it, or follow a target by keeping it in the current frame of view generally from behind the target, the focus of our work is on an efficient pursuit of the target such that a certain set of images of it from various orientations can be acquired. We present a method to approach a target in motion from various angles and an analysis of whether the task completion is possible in the cases of a target performing a random walk and an adversarial target.",

By designing force feedback signals constructed only from visual imagery data as input into a haptic device, we show the impact on human performance during the teleoperation sequence. The methodology is explained in detail, and results of implementation on object-centering and object-approaching tasks with our divided force guidance approach are presented.",

In previous research, helicopters were usually controlled by sensors such as GPSs and gyros. However, it is difficult to mount those sensors on small- scale helicopters that have little payload. Accordingly, small lightweight cameras were used to control the helicopter in this research. The applications of the cameras are for observation of the environment and the measurement of the position and attitude of the helicopter. The system of mounted cameras on the helicopter is useful for an indoor surveillance system using the helicopter as a mobile camera. The efficacy of the constructed system was verified through experimentation of automatic hovering control and guidance control.",

Our experiments show that for loops of over 50 m, the pose estimates maintained with a delayed-state extended information filter are consistent enough to guarantee assertion of vision- based pose constraints for loop closure, provided no necessary information links are added to the estimator. The technique computes relative pose constraints via a robust least squares minimization of 3D point correspondences, which are in turn obtained from the matching of SIFT features over candidate image pairs. We propose a loop closure test that checks both for closeness of means and for highly informative updates at the same time.",

The goal of this paper1 is to develop methods for quantifying the difficulty a robot would encounter traversing such a region of rough terrain. Towards this, three traversability metrics describing rough terrain robot mobility are developed. In order to simplify the problem, we assume that the rough terrain in question can be discretized in a certain manner and then develop the metrics for this discretized version of the terrain. Two of the developed metrics reflect the difficulty a robot would have trying to move over the entire region of terrain (referred to as coverability). The third metric, referred to as crossability, describes the difficulty a robot would encounter attempting to move from some fixed point on the terrain to some other fixed point. We verify the applicability of the developed metrics using NIST-developed repeatable test methods (step fields) and discuss the validity of the obtained results.",

A linearized model of the airplane dynamics and decoupled visual features are used to build the control scheme. A desired trajectory which takes into account the airplane dynamic is designed. Coupling this trajectory and the control law enables the airplane to join its desired path. Then the airplane is controlled to follow the glide path, realize the flare manoeuvre and finally touchdown. Simulation results are obtained with a quite realistic flight simulator which is based on a non linear airplane dynamic model. They show that the airplane is able to land automatically by using visual data.",

        "abstract": "A vocal imitation system was developed using a computational model that supports the motor theory of speech perception. A critical problem in vocal imitation is how to generate speech sounds produced by adults, whose vocal tracts have physical properties (i.e., articulatory motions) differing from those of infants\u2019 vocal tracts. To solve this problem, a model based on the motor theory of speech perception, was constructed. This model suggests that infants simulate the speech generation by estimating their own articulatory motions in order to interpret the speech sounds of adults. Applying this model enables the vocal imitation system to estimate articulatory motions for unexperienced speech sounds that have not actually been generated by the system. The system was implemented by using Recurrent Neural Network with Parametric Bias (RNNPB) and a physical vocal tract model, called the Maeda model. Experimental results demonstrated that the system was sufficiently robust with respect to individual differences in speech sounds and could imitate unexperienced vowel sounds.",

        "abstract": "This paper discusses biomimetic water strider robots that have microfabricated hydrophobic legs. Various kinds of supporting legs with hydrophobic microstructures on their surfaces were developed using MEMS (micro electromechanical systems) techniques. The lift and pull-off forces of these supporting legs were analyzed theoretically and then measured. The experimental results were in good agreement with the calculations. Two different mechanisms for autonomous water strider robots were developed. One robot with twelve microfabricated legs driven by a vibration motor successfully moved on a water surface and also made left/right turns by exploiting differences in the resonant frequencies of the legs. The other robot, with six microstructured legs, moved on water through elliptical motion of its middle legs, which is similar to the motion of actual water striders.",

I-PENTAR consists of a body with a high powered waist joint, arms designed for safety, and a wheeled inverted pendulum mobile platform. It is modeled as a three-dimensional robot with controls for inclination angle, linear position, and steering angle, and is controlled by state feedback control based on the LQR method. The motion planning of standing and sitting-important motions for an inverted pendulum type robot in practical use-is proposed. It was experimentally confirmed that I-PENTAR could realize a series of fundamental motions required in practical use, which are standing, running, turning, and sitting stably.",

        "abstract": "Planetary exploration requires rovers to perform a variety of challenging tasks autonomously. In order to complete relevant scientific mission, these rovers need to overcome difficulty for rough terrain traversing by \"online methods\". This paper discusses an idea that utilizes a rover mobile center of mass in order to aid in traversing rough terrain. According to vehicle pitch angle and contact angles, the rover recalculates the optimal position for the center of mass to minimize the indicator defined by two factors : the wheel driving force over the wheel normal force (adhesion coefficient) and tip-over stability angle (stability coefficient). Two innovative approaches are developed in this paper. The first one is that the authors defines easily comprehensible two factors, adhesion and stability coefficients for traversability indicator and proposes a method to calculate optimal center of mass position. The second one is that in the case of four-wheels drive, the relation between the front wheel and the rear wheel adhesion coefficient is easily solved and the best case for giving the driving forces can be solved as force making the front and the rear wheel adhesion coefficient equal. The authors call this \"optimal force distribution method\". Finally, this paper shows some simulation results for traversing rough terrain that compute the optimal center of mass while traversing the terrain.",

Periodic motion is typically associated with propulsion underwater and specifically with the kicking of human swimmers. By computing local amplitude spectra in a video sequence, we find the location of a diver in the robot's field of view. We use the Fourier transform to extract the responses of varying intensities in the image space over time to detect characteristic low frequency oscillations to identify an undulating flipper motion associated with typical gaits. In case of detecting multiple locations that exhibit large low-frequency energy responses, we combine the gait detector with other methods to eliminate false detections. We present results of our algorithm on open-ocean video footage of swimming divers, and also discuss possible extensions and enhancements of the proposed approach for tracking other objects that exhibit low- frequency oscillatory motion.",

It is desirable that the base attitude deviation of the robot is minimized for accurate operation by a manipulator arm mounted on it, for communication with the earth, and the ideal contact with the target so that the target would not be pushed away, impedance control and Distributed Momentum Control are reasonable for the above two requirements. The proposed strategy includes both control methods simultaneously using the manipulator's redundancy. Moreover, a control law for reaction wheels is proposed so that the singularity problem would not happened. The proposed strategy is verified from results of numerical simulations that compare the different degree of freedom manipulator.",

Insofar as a distinction is maintained between them, the levels serve different purposes and thus exhibit different characteristic strengths and weaknesses. Exchanging information among organizational levels can be used to mitigate the shortcomings of one level by making use of the strengths of another. In this paper, we highlight the roles, characteristics, and relations between the infrastructure and the architecture of complex robots, describing a novel form of integration that results from enabling the exchange of information between these two levels, which otherwise is maintained internally. The information from the infrastructure is especially amenable for use by the architecture to achieve a higher level of robustness and system awareness. We demonstrate the functionality and utility of the proposed mechanisms in a set of experiments in which failures of architectural components are induced on an actual robot engaged in a joint human-robot team task.",
