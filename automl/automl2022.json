        "abstract": "Reinforcement learning (RL) offers the potential for training generally capable agents that can interact autonomously in the real world. However, one key limitation is the brittleness of RL algorithms to core hyperparameters and network architecture choice. Furthermore, non-stationarities such as evolving training data and increased agent complexity mean that different hyperparameters and architectures may be optimal at different points of training. This motivates AutoRL, a class of methods seeking to automate these design choices. One prominent class of AutoRL methods is Population-Based Training (PBT), which have led to impressive performance in several large scale settings. In this paper, we introduce two new innovations in PBT-style methods. First, we employ trust-region based Bayesian Optimization, enabling full coverage of the high-dimensional mixed hyperparameter search space. Second, we show that using a generational approach, we can also learn both architectures and hyperparameters jointly on-the-fly in a single training run. Leveraging the new highly parallelizable Brax physics engine, we show that these innovations lead to dramatic performance gains, significantly outperforming the tuned baseline while learning entire configurations on the fly.",

However, one key limitation is the brittleness of RL algorithms to core hyperparameters and network architecture choice. Furthermore, non-stationarities such as evolving training data and increased agent complexity mean that different hyperparameters and architectures may be optimal at different points of training. This motivates AutoRL, a class of methods seeking to automate these design choices. One prominent class of AutoRL methods is Population-Based Training (PBT), which have led to impressive performance in several large scale settings. In this paper, we introduce two new innovations in PBT-style methods. First, we employ trust-region based Bayesian Optimization, enabling full coverage of the high-dimensional mixed hyperparameter search space. Second, we show that using a generational approach, we can also learn both architectures and hyperparameters jointly on-the-fly in a single training run.

Due to inaccurate predictions, the selected architectures are generally suboptimal, which we quantify as an expected reduction in accuracy and hypervolume.

We evaluate 18 different performance predictors on ten combinations of metrics, devices, network types, and training tasks, and find that MLP models are the most promising. We then simulate and evaluate how the guidance of such prediction models affects the subsequent architecture selection. Due to inaccurate predictions, the selected architectures are generally suboptimal, which we quantify as an expected reduction in accuracy and hypervolume. We show that simply verifying the predictions of just the selected architectures can lead to substantially improved results. Under a time budget, we find it preferable to use a fast and inaccurate prediction model over accurate but slow live measurements.}\n}",
