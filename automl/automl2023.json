        "abstract": "Understanding the efficacy of a method requires ablation experiments. Current Machine Learning (ML) workflows emphasize the vertical scaling of large models with paradigms such as \u2018data-parallelism\u2019 or \u2018model-parallelism\u2019. As a consequence, there is a lack of methods for horizontal scaling of multiple experimental trials. Horizontal scaling is labor intensive when different tools are used for different experiment stages, such as for hyper-parameter optimization, distributed execution, or the consolidation of artifacts. We identify that errors in earlier stages of experimentation propagate to the analysis. Based on our observations, experimental results, and the current literature, we provide recommendations on best practices to prevent errors. To reduce the effort required to perform an accurate analysis and address common errors when scaling the execution of multiple experiments, we introduce ABLATOR. Our framework uses a stateful experiment design paradigm that provides experiment persistence and is robust to errors. Our actionable analysis artifacts are automatically produced by the experiment state and reduce the time to evaluate a hypothesis. We evaluate ABLATOR with ablation studies on a Transformer model, \u2018Tablator\u2019, where we study the effect of 6 architectural components, 8 model hyperparameters, 3 training hyperparameters, and 4 dataset preprocessing methodologies on 11 tabular datasets. We performed the largest ablation experiment for tabular data on Transformer models to date, evaluating 2,337 models in total.

Domain adaptation (DA) aims to address this by providing various frameworks for adapting models to the deployment data without using labels. However, the domain shift scenario raises a second more subtle challenge: the difficulty of performing hyperparameter optimisation (HPO) for these adaptation algorithms without access to a labelled validation set. The unclear validation protocol for DA has led to bad practices in the literature, such as performing HPO using the target test labels when, in real-world scenarios, they are not available. This has resulted in over-optimism about DA research progress compared to reality. In this paper, we analyse the state of DA when using good evaluation practice, by benchmarking a suite of candidate validation criteria and using them to assess popular adaptation algorithms. We show that there are challenges across all three branches of domain adaptation methodology including Unsupervised Domain Adaptation (UDA), Source-Free Domain Adaptation (SFDA), and Test Time Adaptation (TTA). While the results show that realistically achievable performance is often worse than expected, they also show that using proper validation splits is beneficial, as well as showing that some previously unexplored validation metrics provide the best options to date.

(2004) to ensemble models found during model selection post hoc. Thereby, boosting predictive performance and likely following Auto-Sklearn 1\u2019s insight that alternatives, like stacking or gradient-free numerical optimization, overfit. Overfitting in Auto-Sklearn 1 is much more likely than in other AutoML systems because it uses only low-quality validation data for post hoc ensembling. Therefore, we were motivated to analyze whether Auto-Sklearn 1\u2019s insight holds true for systems with higher-quality validation data. Consequently, we compared the performance of covariance matrix adaptation evolution strategy (CMA-ES), state-of-the-art gradient-free numerical optimization, to GES on the 71 classification datasets from the AutoML benchmark for AutoGluon. We found that Auto-Sklearn\u2019s insight depends on the chosen metric. For the metric ROC AUC, CMA-ES overfits drastically and is outperformed by GES \u2013 statistically significantly for multi-class classification. For the metric balanced accuracy, CMA-ES does not overfit and outperforms GES significantly. Motivated by the successful application of CMA-ES for balanced accuracy, we explored methods to stop CMA-ES from overfitting for ROC AUC. We propose a method to normalize the weights produced by CMA-ES, inspired by GES, that avoids overfitting for CMA-ES and makes CMA-ES perform better than or similar to GES for ROC AUC.",

We demonstrate that the MA-BBOB generator can help fill the instance space, while overall patterns in algorithm performance are preserved.

Recently, both accuracy and latency predictors have been used in NAS with great success, achieving high sample efficiency and accurate modeling of hardware (HW) device latency respectively. However, a new accuracy predictor needs to be trained for every new NAS search space or NN task, and a new latency predictor needs to be additionally trained for every new HW device. In this paper, we explore methods to enable multi-task, multi-search-space, and multi-HW adaptation of accuracy and latency predictors to reduce the cost of NAS.  We introduce a novel search-space independent NN encoding based on zero-cost proxies that achieves sample-efficient prediction on multiple tasks and NAS search spaces, improving the end-to-end sample efficiency of latency and accuracy predictors by over an order of magnitude in multiple scenarios. For example, our NN encoding enables multi-search-space transfer of latency predictors from NASBench-201 to FBNet (and vice-versa) in under 85 HW measurements, a 400${\\times}$ improvement in sample efficiency compared to a recent meta-learning approach.

Selecting the portfolio is a non-trivial task that requires balancing the trade-off between the higher flexibility of large portfolios with the increased complexity of the AAS task.

We evaluate two distinct meta-representation techniques (SHAP and performance2vec) for selecting complementary portfolios from a total of 324 different variants of CMA-ES for the task of optimizing the BBOB single-objective problems in dimensionalities 5 and 30 with different cut-off budgets. We test two types of portfolios: one related to overall algorithm behavior and the \u2018personalized\u2019 one (related to algorithm behavior per each problem separately). We observe that the approach built on the performance2vec-based representations favors small portfolios with negligible error in the AAS task relative to the virtual best solver from the selected portfolio, whereas the portfolios built from the SHAP-based representations gain from higher flexibility at the cost of decreased performance of the AAS. Across most considered scenarios, personalized portfolios yield comparable or slightly better performance than the classical greedy approach. They outperform the full portfolio in all scenarios.",

        "abstract": "Hyperparameter optimization (HPO) methods can determine well-performing hyperparameter configurations efficiently but often lack insights and transparency. We propose to apply symbolic regression to meta-data collected with Bayesian optimization (BO) during HPO. In contrast to prior approaches explaining the effects of hyperparameters on model performance, symbolic regression allows for obtaining explicit formulas quantifying the relation between hyperparameter values and model performance. Overall, our approach aims to make the HPO process more explainable and human-centered, addressing the needs of multiple user groups: First, providing insights into the HPO process can support data scientists and machine learning practitioners in their decisions when using and interacting with HPO tools. Second, obtaining explicit formulas and inspecting their properties could help researchers understand the HPO loss landscape better. In an experimental evaluation, we find that naively applying symbolic regression directly to meta-data collected during HPO is affected by the sampling bias introduced by BO.

We propose to apply symbolic regression to meta-data collected with Bayesian optimization (BO) during HPO. In contrast to prior approaches explaining the effects of hyperparameters on model performance, symbolic regression allows for obtaining explicit formulas quantifying the relation between hyperparameter values and model performance. Overall, our approach aims to make the HPO process more explainable and human-centered, addressing the needs of multiple user groups: First, providing insights into the HPO process can support data scientists and machine learning practitioners in their decisions when using and interacting with HPO tools. Second, obtaining explicit formulas and inspecting their properties could help researchers understand the HPO loss landscape better. In an experimental evaluation, we find that naively applying symbolic regression directly to meta-data collected during HPO is affected by the sampling bias introduced by BO. However, the true underlying loss landscape can be approximated by fitting the symbolic regression on the surrogate model trained during BO. By penalizing longer formulas, symbolic regression furthermore allows the user to decide how to balance the accuracy and explainability of the resulting formulas.}\n}",
