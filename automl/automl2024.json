        "abstract": "Online learning poses a significant challenge to AutoML, as the best model and configuration may change depending on the data distribution. To address this challenge, we propose Automated Streaming Machine Learning (ASML), an online learning framework that automatically finds the best machine learning models and their configurations for changing data streams. It adapts to the online learning scenario by continuously exploring a large and diverse pipeline configuration space. It uses an adaptive optimisation technique that utilizes the current best design, adaptive random directed nearby search, and an ensemble of best performing pipelines. We experimented with real and synthetic drifting data streams and showed that ASML can build accurate and adaptive pipelines by constantly exploring and responding to changes. In several datasets, it outperforms existing online AutoML and state-of-the-art online learning algorithms.",

To tackle such a drawback, the one-shot NAS setting was introduced, where a supernet is used as a superposition of all architectures in the space and performs the search in a single training phase. While this method significantly reduces the cost of running NAS, the joint optimization of every architecture degrades the performance of the search. The few-shot NAS line of work tackles this issue by splitting the supernet into sub-supernets trained separately, each with a reduced level of weight-sharing, which gives rise to the new challenge of finding the best way to split the supernet. In particular, GM-NAS utilizes a gradient matching score to group operations in a splitting schema. We extend and generalize this method by building a framework with compatibility for any arbitrary architecture evaluation metric, enabling the generation of numerous and diverse splits.

        "abstract": "Any supervised machine learning analysis is required to provide an estimate of the out-of-sample predictive performance. However, it is imperative to also provide a quantification of the uncertainty of this performance in the form of a confidence or credible interval (CI) and not just a point estimate. In an AutoML setting, estimating the CI is challenging due to the \u201cwinner\u2019s curse\u201d, i.e., the bias of estimation due to cross-validating several machine learning pipelines and selecting the winning one. In this work, we perform a comparative evaluation of 9 state-of-the-art methods and variants in CI estimation in an AutoML setting on a corpus of real and simulated datasets. The methods are compared in terms of inclusion percentage (does a 95% CI interval include the true performance at least 95% of the time), CI tightness (tighter CIs are preferable as being more informative), and execution time. The evaluation is the first one that covers most, if not all, such methods and extends previous work to multi-class, imbalanced, and small-sample tasks. In addition, we present a variant, called BBC-F, of an existing method (the Bootstrap Bias Correction, or BBC) that maintains the statistical properties of the BBC but is more computationally efficient. The results support that BBC-F and BBC dominate the other methods in all metrics measured. However, the results also point to open problems and challenges in producing accurate CIs of performance, particularly in the case of multi-class tasks.",

However, it is imperative to also provide a quantification of the uncertainty of this performance in the form of a confidence or credible interval (CI) and not just a point estimate. In an AutoML setting, estimating the CI is challenging due to the \u201cwinner\u2019s curse\u201d, i.e., the bias of estimation due to cross-validating several machine learning pipelines and selecting the winning one. In this work, we perform a comparative evaluation of 9 state-of-the-art methods and variants in CI estimation in an AutoML setting on a corpus of real and simulated datasets. The methods are compared in terms of inclusion percentage (does a 95% CI interval include the true performance at least 95% of the time), CI tightness (tighter CIs are preferable as being more informative), and execution time. The evaluation is the first one that covers most, if not all, such methods and extends previous work to multi-class, imbalanced, and small-sample tasks. In addition, we present a variant, called BBC-F, of an existing method (the Bootstrap Bias Correction, or BBC) that maintains the statistical properties of the BBC but is more computationally efficient. The results support that BBC-F and BBC dominate the other methods in all metrics measured. However, the results also point to open problems and challenges in producing accurate CIs of performance, particularly in the case of multi-class tasks.}\n}",

        "abstract": "While automated machine learning (AutoML) can save human labor in finding well-performing pipelines, it often suffers from two problems: overfitting and using excessive resources.  Unfortunately, the solutions are often at odds: cross-validation helps reduce overfitting at the expense of more resources; conversely, preprocessing on a separate compute cluster and then cross-validating only the final predictor saves resources at the expense of more overfitting.  This paper shows how to train and cross-validate entire pipelines on a single moderate machine with limited memory by using monoids, which are associative, thus providing a flexible way for handling large data one batch at a time.  To facilitate AutoML, our approach is designed to support the common sklearn APIs used by many AutoML systems for pipelines, training, cross-validation, and several operators.  Abstracted behind those APIs, our approach uses task graphs to extend the benefits of monoids from operators to pipelines, and provides a multi-backend implementation.  Overall, our approach lets users train and cross-validate pipelines on simple and inexpensive compute infrastructure.",

        "abstract": "Weight sharing is a fundamental concept in neural architecture search (NAS), enabling gradient-based methods to explore cell-based architectural spaces significantly faster than traditional blackbox approaches. In parallel, weight entanglement has emerged as a technique for more intricate parameter sharing amongst macro-architectural spaces. Since weight-entanglement is not directly compatible with gradient-based NAS methods, these  two paradigms have largely developed independently in parallel sub-communities. This paper aims to bridge the gap between these sub-communities by proposing a novel scheme to adapt gradient-based methods for weight-entangled spaces. This enables us to conduct an in-depth comparative assessment and analysis of the performance of gradient-based NAS in weight-entangled search spaces. Our findings reveal that this integration of weight-entanglement and gradient-based NAS brings forth the various benefits of gradient-based methods, while preserving the memory efficiency of weight-entangled spaces.
