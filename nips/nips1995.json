        "abstract": "The vestibulo-ocular reflex  (VOR)  stabilizes  images  on  the  retina during  rapid  head motions.  The gain of the VOR (the ratio of eye to head rotation velocity)  is  typically around -1  when the eyes are focused on a distant target.  However, to  stabilize images accurately, the VOR gain must vary  with context (eye position,  eye vergence and head  translation).  We  first  describe  a  kinematic  model of the  VOR which relies solely on sensory information available from the semicircular  canals (head rotation), the otoliths (head translation), and neural correlates of eye  position and vergence angle.  We then propose a dynamical model and compare it  to the eye velocity responses measured in monkeys. The dynamical model repro(cid:173) duces the observed amplitude and time course of the modulation of the VOR and  suggests one way to combine the required neural signals within the cerebellum and  the brain stem.  It also makes predictions for the responses of neurons to multiple  inputs (head rotation and translation, eye position, etc.) in the oculomotor system.",

The  emphasis  is  that  such  learning  tasks  could  be  formulated  as  an  embedding  problem  of  dynamical  systems:  desired  trajectories  in  a  task space  should  be  embedded  into an  adequate  sensory-based internal  state  space  so  that an unique mapping from the internal state space to the motor  command could  be established.  The  paper shows that a  recurrent  neural network suffices in self-organizing such an adequate internal  state space  from  the temporal  sensory input.  In  our experiments,  using  a  real  robot  with  a  laser  range  sensor,  the  robot  navigated  robustly  by achieving dynamical coherence with  the environment.  It was  also  shown  that  such  coherence  becomes  structurally  sta(cid:173) ble  as  the  global  attractor is  self-organized  in the coupling of the  internal and the environmental dynamics.",

We present a framework for non-rigid match(cid:173) ing that begins with a skeleton module, affine point matching,  and then integrates multiple features to improve correspondence  and develops an object representation based on spatial regions to  model local transformations. The algorithm for feature matching  iteratively updates the transformation parameters and the corre(cid:173) spondence solution, each in turn. The affine mapping is solved in  closed form, which permits its use for data of any dimension. The  correspondence is set via a method for two-way constraint satisfac(cid:173) tion, called softassign, which has recently emerged from the neural  network/statistical physics realm. The complexity of the non-rigid  matching algorithm with multiple features is the same as that of  the affine point matching algorithm. Results for synthetic and real  world data are provided for point sets in 2D and 3D, and for 2D  data with multiple types of features and parts.",

In this  paper the problem of auditory scene segmentation is considered and a  model of the early stages of the process is proposed. The behaviour of  the model is shown to be in agreement with a number of well known  psychophysical results. The principal contribution of this model lies in  demonstrating how streaming might result from interactions between  the tonotopic patterns of activity of input signals and traces of previous  activity which feedback and influence the way in which subsequent  signals are processed.",

This type of representation is able  to perform nonlinear sensorimotor transformations and is consis(cid:173) tent with the response properties of parietal neurons. We now ask  whether the same theory could account for the behavior of human  patients with parietal lesions. These lesions induce a deficit known  as hemineglect that is characterized by a lack of reaction to stimuli  located in the hemispace contralateral to the lesion. A simulated  lesion in a basis function representation was found to replicate three  of the most important aspects of hemineglect: i) The models failed  to cross the leftmost lines in line cancellation experiments, ii) the  deficit affected multiple frames of reference and, iii) it could be  object centered. These results strongly support the basis function  hypothesis for spatial representations and provide a computational  theory of hemineglect at the single cell level.",

The autoassociator is  trained  to  reconstruct  spectra obtained  from the healthy motor.  In laboratory tests, we have demonstrated that the  trained autoassociator has a small reconstruction error on measurements  recorded from healthy motors but a larger error on those recorded from a  motor with a fault.  We have designed and built a motor monitoring system  using an  autoassociator for anomaly detection and are in the process of  testing the system at three industrial and commercial sites.",

The  first  layer  of  the  neural  network  is  a  hardware  linear  classifier  which  recognizes  the  characters  in  this  font .  A  second  software  neural  layer  is  implemented  on  an  inexpensive  microprocessor  to  clean  up  the  re(cid:173) sults of the first  layer.  The hardware linear  classifier  is  mathematically  specified  using  constraints  and  an  optimization  principle.  The  weights  of the  classifier  are  found  using  the  active  set  method,  similar  to  Vap(cid:173) nik's separating hyperplane algorithm.  In 7.5 minutes ofSPARC 2 time,  the  method solves for  1523  Lagrange mUltipliers,  which  is  equivalent  to  training  on  a  data set  of approximately  128,000  examples.  The  result(cid:173) ing network  performs quite  well:  when  tested  on  a  test set  of 1500  real  checks,  it has  a  99.995%  character accuracy  rate.",

The  dependency  is  measured  by  the  average  mutual  in(cid:173) formation  (MI)  of the outputs.  The source signals and the mixing  matrix  are  unknown  except  for  the  number  of  the  sources.  The  Gram-Charlier  expansion  instead  of the  Edgeworth  expansion  is  used  in  evaluating  the  MI.  The  natural gradient  approach is  used  to minimize the MI.

        "abstract": "In  this  paper we  examine  a  perceptron  learning  task.  The  task  is  realizable  since  it  is  provided  by  another  perceptron  with  identi(cid:173) cal  architecture.  Both  perceptrons  have  nonlinear  sigmoid  output  functions.  The gain  of the output function  determines the level  of  nonlinearity  of the  learning  task.  It is  observed  that  a  high  level  of nonlinearity leads to overfitting. We  give an explanation for  this  rather  surprising  observation  and  develop  a  method  to  avoid  the  overfitting.  This  method  has  two  possible  interpretations,  one  is  learning with noise,  the other cross-validated early stopping.",

The  method,  which  is  based on  ideas  from  information  theory  and  analogies  to  statistical  physics,  assigns  data to  classes  in  probability.  The  dis(cid:173) tributions  are  chosen  to minimize the  expected  classification  error  while  simultaneously enforcing  the classifier's structure and a level  of \"randomness\"  measured  by  Shannon's entropy.  Achievement of  the classifier structure is  quantified by an  associated cost.  The con(cid:173) strained optimization  problem is  equivalent to the minimization of  a  Helmholtz  free  energy,  and  the  resulting  optimization  method  is  a  basic  extension  of the  deterministic  annealing  algorithm  that  explicitly  enforces  structural  constraints on  assignments  while  re(cid:173) ducing  the  entropy  and  expected  cost  with  temperature.  In  the  limit of low temperature, the error rate is minimized directly and a  hard classifier with the requisite structure is  obtained.  This learn(cid:173) ing algorithm can be used to design a variety of classifier structures.  The approach is  compared with standard methods for  radial basis  function  design  and  is  demonstrated  to  substantially  outperform  other  design  methods  on  several  benchmark  examples,  while  of(cid:173) ten retaining design complexity comparable to,  or only moderately  greater than that of strict descent-based methods.",

Experimental  data  demonstrates  cholinergic  suppression  of synaptic  transmission  in  layer I (feedback synapses), and a lack of suppression in layer IV (feed(cid:173) forward synapses).  A network with this feature uses local rules to learn  mappings  which  are not  linearly  separable.  During  learning,  sensory  stimuli  and  desired  response  are  simultaneously  presented  as  input.  Feedforward connections  form  self-organized representations  of input,  while suppressed feedback connections learn  the  transpose of feedfor(cid:173) ward connectivity. During recall, suppression is removed, sensory input  activates  the  self-organized  representation,  and  activity  generates  the  learned response.",

        "abstract": "Intermediate and higher vision processes  require selection of a sub(cid:173) set  of the  available sensory  information  before  further  processing.  Usually,  this  selection  is  implemented  in  the  form  of a  spatially  circumscribed  region of the  visual field,  the  so-called  \"focus  of at(cid:173) tention\"  which  scans  the  visual scene  dependent  on the  input  and  on the attentional state of the subject.  We here  present a  model for  the control of the focus of attention in primates, based on a saliency  map.  This mechanism is not only expected  to model the functional(cid:173) ity of biological vision but also to be essential for the understanding  of complex scenes  in machine vision.",

        "abstract": "There is  currently  considerable interest  in developing general non(cid:173) linear  density  models  based  on  latent,  or  hidden,  variables.  Such  models have the ability to discover the presence of a relatively small  number of underlying  'causes'  which,  acting  in  combination,  give  rise  to the apparent complexity of the observed  data set.  Unfortu(cid:173) nately, to train such models generally requires large computational  effort.  In this paper we  introduce a  novel  latent variable algorithm  which retains the general non-linear capabilities of previous models  but  which  uses  a  training procedure  based  on  the  EM  algorithm.  We  demonstrate  the  performance  of the  model  on  a  toy  problem  and on data from flow  diagnostics for  a  multi-phase oil  pipeline.",

This system was proposed in  order  to  overcome  a  \"real  time\"  response  constraint.  Two  basic  architectures are evaluated:  1) a feedforward network-heuristic and; 2) a  feedforward  network-recurrent  network.  These  architectures  are  compared against a linear programming (LP) optimiser as  a benchmark.  This LP optimiser was  also used as  a teacher to label  the  data samples  for  the feedforward  neural  network training  algorithm.  It is  found  that  the systems  are  able to provide a traffic  throughput  of 99%  and  95%,  respectively,  of  the  throughput  obtained  by  the  linear  programming  solution. Once trained, the neural network based solutions are found in a  fraction of the time required by the LP optimiser.",

Often  the  parameters used  in  these  net(cid:173) works  need  to  be  learned  from examples.  Unfortunately,  estimat(cid:173) ing  the  parameters  via  exact  probabilistic  calculations  (i.e,  the  EM-algorithm)  is  intractable  even  for  networks  with  fairly  small  numbers of hidden  units.  We  propose  to  avoid the  infeasibility of  the  E step  by  bounding likelihoods instead of computing them ex(cid:173) actly.  We  introduce extended  and  complementary representations  for  these  networks  and  show  that  the  estimation  of the  network  parameters  can  be  made fast  (reduced  to  quadratic optimization)  by  performing the estimation in either of the  alternative domains.

Each expert is trained by  minimizing  a penalized local cross vali(cid:173) dation error using second order methods. In this way, an expert is able to  find a local distance metric by adjusting the size and  shape of the recep(cid:173) tive field in which its predictions are valid, and also to detect relevant in(cid:173) put features  by  adjusting  its bias  on  the  importance of individual input  dimensions. We derive asymptotic results for our method. In a variety of  simulations the properties of the algorithm are demonstrated with respect  to  interference,  learning  speed,  prediction  accuracy,  feature  detection,  and task oriented incremental learning.",

In this paper,  we present positive results for all the control tasks they attempted, and  for  one that is significantly larger.  The most important differences  are  that  we  used  sparse-coarse-coded  function  approximators  (CMACs)  whereas  they used mostly global function  approximators, and that we  learned  online  whereas  they  learned  offline.  Boyan  and  Moore  and  others  have  suggested  that  the  problems  they  encountered  could  be  solved  by  using  actual  outcomes  (\"rollouts\"),  as  in  classical  Monte  Carlo  methods,  and as in the TD().)  algorithm when). =  1.

In  this  paper  we  present  a  technique  called  ADDEMUP  that  uses  genetic  algorithms  to  directly  search  for  an  accurate  and  diverse  set  of trained  networks.  ADDEMUP  works  by  first  creating an ini(cid:173) tial  population,  then  uses  genetic  operators  to  continually  create  new  networks,  keeping the set of networks that are as  accurate as  possible while disagreeing with each other as much as possible.  Ex(cid:173) periments on three DNA problems show that  ADDEMUP  is able to  generate a  set of trained  networks that is  more accurate than sev(cid:173) eral existing  approaches.  Experiments  also  show  that  ADDEMUP  is  able  to  effectively  incorporate  prior  knowledge,  if  available,  to  improve the quality of its ensemble.",

Given  a  training set and  a  validation  set,  all  weight  vectors  found  by  early  stopping must  lie  on  a  cer(cid:173) tain quadric surface, usually an ellipsoid.  Given a training set and  a  candidate early stopping weight  vector,  all  validation  sets  have  least-squares weights lying on a certain plane.  This latter fact  can  be exploited  to estimate  the  probability  of stopping  at any  given  point along the trajectory from the initial weight vector to the least(cid:173) squares weights  derived from  the training set, and to estimate the  probability  that  training  goes  on  indefinitely.

        "abstract": "The  process  of machine  learning  can  be  considered  in  two  stages:  model  selection  and parameter estimation.  In this  paper a  technique  is  presented  for constructing dynamical systems with desired qualitative properties.  The  approach  is  based  on the fact  that  an n-dimensional  nonlinear  dynamical  system can be decomposed into one gradient and  (n - 1)  Hamiltonian sys(cid:173) tems.  Thus, the model  selection stage consists of choosing the gradient and  Hamiltonian portions appropriately so that a certain behavior is obtainable.  To estimate the parameters, a stably convergent learning rule  is  presented.  This algorithm has been proven to converge to the desired system trajectory  for  all  initial  conditions  and system inputs.  This technique can be used to  design  neural network models  which  are guaranteed to solve the trajectory  learning problem.",

In  this  paper,  we  propose  to use  a  more general  type  of a-priori  knowledge,  namely  that  the  temporal  dependencIes  are  structured  hierarchically.  This implies that  long-term  dependencies  are  represented  by  variables with  a long time scale.  This principle is  applied  to a recurrent network which includes delays and multiple time scales.  Ex(cid:173) periments confirm the advantages of such  structures.

A retinally  connected  neural  network  examines  small  windows  of an  image,  and  decides  whether each  window  contains  a  face.  The  system  arbitrates  between multiple networks to improve performance over a single network.  We  use  a  bootstrap  algorithm for training, which  adds  false  detections  into the training set as  training progresses.  This eliminates the difficult  task  of manually  selecting  non-face  training examples,  which  must  be  chosen  to span the entire space of non-face images.  Comparisons with  another state-of-the-art face  detection system are presented;  our system  has better performance in terms of detection and false-positive rates.",

CMOS  Compatible  Lateral  Bipolar  Transistors  (CLBTs)  can  create  exponentially scaled currents when biased using a resistive line with a  voltage  difference  between both  ends  of the  line.  Since these  CLBTs  are  independent  of  the  CMOS  threshold  voltage,  current  sources  implemented  with  CLBTs  are  much  better  matched  than  current  sources  created  with  MOS  transistors  operated  in  weak  inversion.

The el(cid:173) evator domain poses a  combination of challenges not seen in  most  RL  research to date.  Elevator systems operate in continuous state  spaces  and in continuous time  as discrete  event  dynamic systems.  Their  states  are  not  fully  observable  and  they  are  nonstationary  due to changing passenger arrival rates.  In addition, we  use a team  of RL  agents,  each  of which is  responsible  for  controlling one  ele(cid:173) vator car.  The team receives  a  global reinforcement  signal  which  appears noisy to each agent due to the effects of the actions of the  other agents, the random nature of the arrivals and the incomplete  observation of the state.  In  spite  of these complications,  we  show  results that in simulation surpass the best of the heuristic elevator  control  algorithms  of which  we  are  aware.  These  results  demon(cid:173) strate  the  power  of RL  on  a  very  large  scale  stochastic  dynamic  optimization problem of practical utility.",

Nevertheless, most existing methods  in dynamic programming (including Baird's) compute some form of  absolute utility function .  For smooth problems,  advantages satisfy  two  differential  consistency  conditions  (including  the  requirement  that they be free of curl), and we show that enforcing these can lead  to appropriate policy improvement solely in terms of advantages.",

        "abstract": "While  it  is  generally  agreed  that  neurons  transmit  information  about their synaptic inputs through spike trains, the code by which  this  information is  transmitted  is  not  well  understood.  An  upper  bound  on  the  information  encoded  is  obtained  by  hypothesizing  that the precise  timing of each spike conveys information.  Here  we  develop  a  general  approach  to quantifying the information carried  by  spike  trains  under  this  hypothesis,  and  apply  it  to  the  leaky  integrate-and-fire  (IF)  model  of  neuronal  dynamics.  We  formu(cid:173) late  the  problem  in  terms  of the  probability  distribution  peT)  of  interspike  intervals  (ISIs),  assuming that  spikes  are  detected  with  arbitrary  but finite  temporal resolution .  In  the  absence  of added  noise,  all  the  variability in  the  ISIs  could encode  information, and  the  information rate  is  simply the entropy of the lSI  distribution,  H (T)  =  (-p(T) log2 p(T)},  times  the  spike  rate.  H (T)  thus  pro(cid:173) vides  an  exact  expression  for  the  information rate.  The  methods  developed  here  can be  used  to determine experimentally the infor(cid:173) mation carried  by  spike  trains,  even  when  the  lower  bound of the  information rate  provided  by  the  stimulus reconstruction  method  is  not  tight.  In  a  preliminary series  of experiments,  we  have  used  these  methods  to estimate information rates of hippocampal neu(cid:173) rons  in  slice  in  response  to somatic  current  injection.  These  pilot  experiments suggest  information rates as  high as  6.3  bits/spike.",

The  system  has  been  implemented in specialized parallel hardware,  which allows  it to run at 80 char/sec/board.  It has been installed  at the Driver and  Vehicle  Licensing  Agency  (DVLA)  in  the  United  Kingdom.  and  its  overall  success  rate  exceeds  96%  (character  level  without  rejects).  which  translates  into  85%  field  rate.

        "abstract": "Compliant control is a standard method for performing fine  manip(cid:173) ulation tasks, like grasping and assembly, but it requires estimation  of the state of contact  (s.o.c.)  between  the robot  arm and  the  ob(cid:173) jects  involved.  Here  we  present  a  method to learn  a  model of the  movement from  measured  data.  The  method  requires  little or  no  prior  knowledge  and  the  resulting  model  explicitly  estimates  the  s.o.c.  The  current  s.o.c.  is  viewed  as  the  hidden  state  variable  of  a  discrete  HMM.  The  control  dependent  transition  probabilities  between  states  are  modeled  as  parametrized functions  of the mea(cid:173) surement.  We  show  that  their  parameters  can  be  estimated  from  measurements at the same time as the parameters of the movement  in  each  s.o.c.  The learning algorithm is  a  variant of the EM  proce(cid:173) dure.  The  E step  is  computed exactly ; solving  the  M step  exactly  is  not possible  in general.  Here,  gradient ascent  is  used  to produce  an increase  in  likelihood .",

This paper presents a self-organizing neural network that learns to detect,  represent,  and predict the visibility and invisibility relationships that arise  during  occlusion  events,  after  a  period  of exposure  to  motion sequences  containing occlusion  and  disocclusion events.  The  network develops  two  parallel opponent  channels  or  \"chains\"  of lateral  excitatory  connections  for  every  resolvable  motion trajectory.  One  channel,  the  \"On\"  chain or  \"visible\"  chain, is  activated when a moving stimulus is visible.  The other  channel, the  \"Off\"  chain or  \"invisible\"  chain,  carries  a persistent,  amodal  representation that predicts the motion of a formerly visible stimulus that  becomes  invisible  due  to occlusion.  The  learning  rule  uses  disinhibition  from  the  On  chain  to  trigger  learning  in  the  Off  chain.  The  On  and  Off chain  neurons  can  learn  separate  associations  with  object  depth  or(cid:173) dering.  The results  are closely  related  to the  recent  discovery  (Assad  &  Maunsell,  1995)  of neurons in macaque monkey posterior  parietal cortex  that respond selectively to inferred  motion of invisible stimuli.",

Solving  exactly  the  simple  model  of an  ensemble  of linear  students,  we  find  surprisingly  rich  behaviour.  For  learning  in  large  ensembles,  it  is  advantageous  to  use  under-regularized  students,  which  actu(cid:173) ally  over-fit  the  training data.  Globally optimal performance  can  be  obtained by  choosing  the training set  sizes  of the students ap(cid:173) propriately.  For  smaller ensembles,  optimization of the  ensemble  weights  can yield significant improvements in ensemble generaliza(cid:173) tion  performance,  in particular if the  individual students  are  sub(cid:173) ject to noise in the training process.  Choosing students with a wide  range of regularization parameters makes this improvement robust  against changes in the unknown level of noise  in the training data.",

The algorithms  build a global non-linear model of the expected output at the same  time as using Bayesian linear regression analysis of locally weighted  polynomial models.  The local  model answers  queries  about  confi(cid:173) dence,  noise,  gradient  and  Hessians,  and  use  them  to  make auto(cid:173) mated decisions similar to those made by a practitioner of Response  Surface  Methodology.  The global  and  local  models are  combined  naturally  as  a  locally  weighted  regression.  We  examine the  ques(cid:173) tion of whether the global model can really  help optimization, and  we  extend  it  to  the  case  of time-varying functions.  We  compare  the new algorithms with a  highly tuned higher-order stochastic op(cid:173) timization algorithm on  randomly-generated functions  and  a  sim(cid:173) ulated  manufacturing  task.  We  note  significant  improvements in  total regret , time to converge, and final  solution quality.",

        "abstract": "Visual cognition depends criticalIy on the ability to make rapid eye movements  known as saccades that orient the fovea over targets of interest in a visual  scene. Saccades are known to be ballistic: the pattern of muscle activation  for foveating a prespecified target location is computed prior to the movement  and visual feedback is precluded. Despite these distinctive properties, there  has been no general model of the saccadic targeting strategy employed by  the human visual system during visual search in natural scenes. This paper  proposes a model for saccadic targeting that uses iconic scene representations  derived from oriented spatial filters at multiple scales. Visual search proceeds  in a coarse-to-fine fashion with the largest scale filter responses being compared  first. The model was empirically tested by comparing its perfonnance with  actual eye movement data from human subjects in a natural visual search task;  preliminary results indicate substantial agreement between eye movements  predicted by the model and those recorded from human subjects.",

A  linear  threshold element computes  a  function  that is  a sign of a weighted sum of the input variables.  The weights  are  arbitrary  integers;  actually,  they  can  be  very  big  integers-(cid:173) exponential  in  the  number  of  the  input  variables.  However,  in  practice,  it  is  difficult  to  implement  big  weights.  In  the  present  literature  a  distinction  is  made  between  the  two  extreme  cases:  linear threshold functions  with polynomial-size weights as opposed  to those  with exponential-size weights.  The  main  contribution  of  this paper is  to fill  up  the gap by further  refining  that separation.  Namely,  we  prove that the class of linear threshold functions  with  polynomial-size  weights  can  be  divided  into  subclasses  according  to the degree of the polynomial.  In fact,  we  prove  a  more general  that there exists a minimal weight linear threshold function  result- for  any arbitrary number of inputs and any  weight  size.  To prove  those results we  have developed a  novel technique for  constructing  linear threshold functions  with minimal weights.",

        "abstract": "Recent  experiments  show  that  the  neural  codes  at  work  in  a  wide  range of creatures share some common features.  At first sight, these  observations seem unrelated.  However,  we show  that these  features  arise naturally in  a linear filtered  threshold crossing  (LFTC) model  when we set the threshold to maximize the transmitted information.  This maximization process  requires  neural  adaptation  to  not only  the  DC  signal  level,  as  in  conventional  light  and  dark  adaptation,  but also to the statistical structure of the signal and noise distribu(cid:173) tions.  We  also  present  a  new  approach for  calculating the  mutual  information between  a  neuron's  output  spike  train and any aspect  of its  input signal  which  does not require  reconstruction  of the  in(cid:173) put  signal.  This formulation  is  valid  provided  the  correlations  in  the  spike  train are  small, and we  provide  a  procedure  for  checking  this  assumption.  This paper is  based  on joint work  (DeWeese  [1],  1995).  Preliminary  results  from  the  LFTC  model  appeared  in  a  previous  proceedings  (DeWeese  [2],  1995),  and the  conclusions  we  reached  at that time have been reaffirmed by further  analysis of the  model.",

We  argue  that a  more general  approach  may be useful,  where similarities between features  are  not con(cid:173) strained to be geometric distances, and the objective function for  topographic matching is chosen explicitly rather than being spec(cid:173) ified implicitly by the self-organizing algorithm.

We describe a new method for prediction  of the  non-local  structure  called  ,8-sheet,  which  consists  of two  or  more  ,8-strands  that  are  connected  by  hydrogen  bonds.  Since,8- strands  are  often  widely separated in the  protein  chain, a network  with two windows is introduced.  After training on a set of proteins  the network  predicts  the sheets  well,  but there are many false  pos(cid:173) itives.  By  using  a  global energy  function  the ,8-sheet  prediction is  combined with a  local prediction of the three secondary structures  a-helix, ,8-strand and coil.  The energy function is minimized using  simulated annealing to give  a  final  prediction.",

Al(cid:173) though  very  general,  the  method  is  developed  in  the  context  of a  statistical  model for  transition-based speech  recognition  using  Ar(cid:173) tificial  Neural  Networks  (ANN)  to  generate  probabilities for  Hid(cid:173) den  Markov  Models  (HMMs).  In  the  new  approach,  we  use  local  conditional posterior probabilities of transitions to estimate global  posterior  probabilities of word  sequences.  Although  we  still  use  ANNs  to  estimate  posterior  probabilities,  the  network  is  trained  with targets that are themselves estimates of local posterior proba(cid:173) bilities.

On the one  hand,  this  scheme can be used for static data when some of the input variables are missing.  On  the  other  hand,  it can also  be  used  for  sequential  data,  when  some of the  input variables are missing or are available at different frequencies.  Unlike in the  case of probabilistic models (e.g.  Gaussian) of the missing variables, the network  does  not  attempt  to  model the  distribution  of the  missmg  variables given  the  observed variables.  Instead it is a  more \"discriminant\" approach that fills  in the  missing variables for  the sole purpose of minimizing a  learning criterion  (e.g.,  to  minimize an output error).",

The  resulting  algorithm  uses  Kalman  filter  estimation  for  the  model  estimation and the gating probability estimation.  Both, 'hard' and  'soft' competition based estimation schemes are developed where in  the former, the most probable network is  adapted and in the latter  all networks  are  adapted by  appropriate weighting of the data.",

SEEMORE's  database  consists  of 100  ob(cid:173) jects  that  are  rigid  (shovel),  non-rigid  (telephone  cord),  articu(cid:173) lated  (book), statistical (shrubbery),  and complex (photographs of  scenes).  Recognition results  were  obtained using a  set of 102 color  and shape feature channels within a simple feedforward network ar(cid:173) chitecture.  In  response  to  a  test  set  of 600  novel  test  views  (6  of  each object)  presented individually in color video images, SEEMORE  identified  the  object correctly  97% of the time (chance is 1%)  using  a  nearest  neighbor  classifier.  Similar levels  of performance  were  obtained for  the  subset  of 15  non-rigid objects.  Generalization be(cid:173) havior reveals emergence  of striking natural category structure  not  explicit in  the  input feature  dimensions.",

Soft assign ,  which  has emerged from  the recurrent  neural  network/statistical physics  framework, enforces  two-way  (assignment) constraints without the  use  of penalty  terms  in  the  energy  functions.  The  soft assign  can  also  be  generalized  from  two-way  winner-take-all  constraints  to  multiple membership constraints which are required for graph par(cid:173) titioning.  The  soft assign  technique  is  compared  to  the  softmax  (Potts  glass).  Within  the  statistical  physics  framework,  softmax  and a penalty term has been a widely used method for enforcing the  two-way constraints common within many combinatorial optimiza(cid:173) tion  problems.  The  benchmarks  present  evidence  that  soft assign  has clear advantages in accuracy, speed,  parallelizabilityand algo(cid:173) rithmic simplicity over softmax and a penalty term in optimization  problems with two-way constraints.",

Networks of this type usually require fewer  hidden layers  and  units and often learn much  faster  than typical  sigmoidal networks.  To  explain these  results we consider a hyper-ridge network,  which is a  simple perceptron with no hidden units and a rid\u00a5e activation function. If  we are interested in partitioningp points in d dimensions into two classes  then in the limit as d approaches infinity the capacity of a hyper-ridge and  a perceptron is identical.  However, we show that for p  ~ d, which is the  usual case in practice, the ratio of hyper-ridge to perceptron dichotomies  approaches pl2(d + 1).",

We  derive  gradient  descent  update equations and apply  the  model  to  the recognition  of speech  phonemes.  We  find  that  both  the  inclusion  of gamma  filters  in  all  layers,  and  the  inclusion  of synaptic  gains,  improves  the  performance  of the  Gamma  MLP.  We  compare  the  Gamma  MLP  with  TDNN,  Back-Tsoi FIR MLP,  and Back-Tsoi I1R  MLP  architectures, and a  local approximation scheme.  We find  that the  Gamma MLP results in an substantial reduction  in error rates.",

One  method of verification is multivariate time-series prediction: a good  model could predict the near-future activity of its inputs, much  as a good scientific theory predicts future data. Such a predict(cid:173) ing model would require copious top-down connections to compare  the predictions with the input. That feedback could improve the  model's performance in two ways: by biasing internal activity to(cid:173) ward expected patterns, and by generating specific error signals if  the predictions fail. A proof-of-concept model-an event-driven,  computationally efficient layered network, incorporating \"cortical\"  features like all-excitatory synapses and local inhibition- was con(cid:173) structed to make near-future predictions of a simple, moving stim(cid:173) ulus. After unsupervised learning, the network contained units not  only tuned to obvious features of the stimulus like contour orienta(cid:173) tion and motion, but also to contour discontinuity (\"end-stopping\")  and illusory contours.",

In  a  comparison  on  a suite of 12  datasets  we  found  that this  method of generating  candidate splits outperformed  the standard  methods,  particularly  when  the training sets were  small.",

        "abstract": "We report on the development of the modular neural system  \"SEE(cid:173) EAGLE\"  for  the  visual  guidance  of robot  pick-and-place  actions.  Several  neural  networks  are  integrated  to  a  single system  that vi(cid:173) sually  recognizes  human hand  pointing gestures  from  stereo  pairs  of color  video  images.  The output of the  hand recognition stage is  processed  by  a  set  of color-sensitive  neural  networks  to  determine  the cartesian location of the target object that is  referenced  by the  pointing gesture.  Finally, this information is  used  to guide a robot  to grab  the  target  object  and  put  it  at  another  location  that  can  be specified  by a second pointing gesture.  The accuracy of the cur(cid:173) rent  system allows to identify the location of the referenced  target  object to an accuracy of 1 cm  in  a  workspace  area of 50x50 cm.  In  our  current  environment,  this  is  sufficient  to  pick  and  place  arbi(cid:173) trarily positioned target objects within the workspace.  The system  consists  of neural  networks  that  perform  the  tasks  of image seg(cid:173) mentation, estimation of hand  location, estimation of 3D-pointing  direction, object recognition, and necessary  coordinate transforms.  Drawing heavily on the use of learning algorithms, the functions of  all  network modules were  created from  data examples only.",

Both  algorithms are  easily  generalized  to  larger  neural  networks,  and the  generalization  of Gradient  Descent  is  the stan(cid:173) dard  back-propagation  algorithm.  In  this  paper  we  prove  worst(cid:173) case  loss  bounds  for  both  algorithms  in  the  single  neuron  case.  Since  local  minima make  it  difficult  to  prove  worst-case  bounds  for  gradient-based  algorithms,  we  must  use  a  loss  function  that  prevents  the  formation of spurious  local  minima.  We  define  such  a  matching  loss  function  for  any  strictly  increasing  differentiable  transfer  function  and  prove  worst-case  loss  bound  for  any  such  transfer  function  and  its  corresponding  matching loss.  For  exam(cid:173) ple,  the  matching loss  for  the  identity function  is  the  square  loss  and  the matching loss  for  the logistic sigmoid is  the entropic loss.  The different  structure  of the bounds for  the  two  algorithms indi(cid:173) cates that the new  algorithm out-performs Gradient Descent  when  the inputs contain a  large number of irrelevant components.",
