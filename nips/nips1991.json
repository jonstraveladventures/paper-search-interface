This method has  been recently applied to feature extraction in the  context of recognizing 3D objects from single 2D views  (Intrator and Gold,  1991).  Here  we  describe  experiments designed to analyze the nature of the  extracted features,  and their  relevance  to the theory and psychophysics of  object  recognition.",

We have built a contrast(cid:173) sensitive silicon retina that models all major synaptic interactions in the  outer-plexiform layer of the vertebrate retina using current-mode CMOS  circuits: namely, reciprocal synapses between cones and horizontal cells,  which produce the antagonistic center/surround receptive field, and cone  and horizontal cell gap junctions, which determine its size.

Locally trained hyper(cid:173) plane segments are an effective way to define the decision boundaries for these  regions [3].  The LLD uses a modified perceptron training algorithm for effective  discovery of separating hyperplane/sigmoid units within narrow boundaries. The  basic unit of the network is the discriminant receptive field (DRF) which combines  the LLD function with Gaussians representing the dispersion of the local training  data with respect to the hyperplane.  The DRF implements a local distance mea(cid:173) sure [4], and obtains the benefits of networks oflocalized units [5].  A constructive  algorithm for the two-class case is described which incorporates DRF's into the  hidden layer to solve local discrimination problems.  The output unit produces a  smoothed, piecewise linear decision boundary.  Preliminary results  indicate the  ability of the LLDN to efficiently achieve separation when boundaries are narrow  and complex,  in  cases where  both the \"standard\" multilayer perceptron (MLP)  and k-nearest neighbor (KNN) yield high error rates on training data.",

A model of this interaction is described, based on Kawato's  principle  of  feedback-error-Iearning.  In  the  model  a  part  of  the  brainstem  (the superior colliculus) acts as a simple feedback controJJer  with no knowledge of initial eye position, and provides an error signal  for the cerebeJJum to correct for eye-muscle nonIinearities.  This teaches  the cerebeJJum,  modelled as a CMAC, to adjust appropriately the gain  on the brainstem burst-generator's internal feedback loop and so alter the  size of burst sent to  the  motoneurons.  With  direction-only errors  the  system rapidly learns to make accurate horizontal eye movements from  any  starting position, and  adapts realistically to  subsequent simulated  eye-muscle weakening or displacement of the saccadic target.",

It is  proven  that  a  weight  decay  has  two effects  in  a  linear  network.  First,  it  suppresses  any  irrelevant  components  of  the  weight  vector  by  choosing  the smallest  vector  that solves  the learning  problem.  Second,  if  the size  is chosen  right,  a weight  decay  can suppress some of the effects  of  static  noise  on  the  targets,  which  improves  generalization  quite  a  lot.  It  is  then  shown  how  to extend  these  results  to networks  with hidden  layers  and  non-linear  units.

        "abstract": "The Probabilistic Neural Network (PNN) algorithm represents the likeli(cid:173) hood function of a given class as the sum of identical, isotropic Gaussians.  In practice, PNN is often an excellent pattern classifier, outperforming  other classifiers including backpropagation. However, it. is not. robust with  respect to affine transformations of feature space, and this can lead to  poor performance on certain data. We have derived an extension of PNN  called Weighted PNN (WPNN) which compensates for this flaw by allow(cid:173) ing anisotropic Gaussians, i.e. Gaussians whose covariance is not a mul(cid:173) tiple of the identity matrix. The covariance is optimized using a genetic  algorithm, some interesting features of which are its redundant, logarith(cid:173) mic encoding and large population size. Experimental results validate our  claims.",

These data allow for the first time a \"local\" as well as \"global\"  description of the spatial patterns and provide strong evidence for corre(cid:173) lations between orientation selectivity and ocular dominance.  A quantitative analysis reveals that these correlations arise when a five(cid:173) dimensional feature space (two dimensions for retinotopic space, one each  for orientation preference, orientation specificity, and ocular dominance) is  mapped into the two available dimensions of cortex while locally preserving  topology. These results provide strong evidence for the concept of topology  preserving maps which have been suggested as a basic design principle of  striate cortex [4-7].",

Many real-valued  connectionist approaches to learning control realize exploration by ran(cid:173) domness in action selection. This might be disadvantageous when costs  are assigned to \"negative experiences\" . The basic idea presented in this  paper is to make an agent explore unknown regions in a more directed  manner. This is achieved by a so-called competence map, which is trained  to predict the controller's accuracy, and is used for guiding exploration.  Based on this, a bistable system enables smoothly switching attention  between two behaviors - exploration and exploitation - depending on ex(cid:173) pected costs and knowledge gain.

Images of digits can be  produced by placing Gaussian ink generators uniformly along the spline.  Real images can be recognized by finding the digit model most likely to  have generated the data.

The model with the lowest  total energy wins. If a uniform noise process is included in the model of  image generation, some of the inked pixels can be rejected as noise as a  digit model is fitting a poorly segmented image.

        "abstract": "Animal  locomotion  patterns  are  controlled  by recurrent  neural  networks  called central pattern generators  (CPGs).  Although  a  CPG  can  oscillate  autonomously,  its  rhythm and  phase  must  be  well  coordinated  with  the  state of the physical system using sensory inputs.  In this paper we propose  a learning algorithm for synchronizing neural and physical oscillators with  specific phase relationships.  Sensory input connections are modified by the  correlation between cellular activities and input signals.  Simulations show  that the learning rule can be used for setting sensory feedback connections  to a  CPG as  well  as coupling connections between CPGs.",

For example, images which contain regions split by an occlud(cid:173) ing object can't be properly reconstructed using this type of network. We  have developed a network that overcomes these limitations, using support  maps to represent the segmentation of a signal. In our approach, the sup(cid:173) port of each region in the signal is explicitly represented. Results from  an initial implementation demonstrate that this method can reconstruct  images and motion sequences which contain complicated occlusion.",

The efficiency measures  the yield of correct networks in proportion to the  training effort expended.  The optimal epoch limit provides the greatest efficiency.

Our results suggest that synchronous bursts can be  generated by a simple neuronal architecture which amplifies incoming coin(cid:173) cident signals.

However,  when the network has a huge number of units (as cortex has) even linear  time might be unacceptable. Furthermore, the algorithm that was given to  achieve this time was based on a single serial processor and was biologically  implausible.  In this work we consider the more natural parallel model of processing  and demonstrate an expected-time complexity that is constant (i.e.  dependent of the size of the network). This holds even when inter-node  communication channels are short and local, thus adhering to more bio(cid:173) logical and VLSI constraints.",

This automated method uses computer controlled mea(cid:173) surement and test equipment to choose chip parameters which minimize  the difference between the actual circuit's behavior and a specified goal  behavior. Choosing the proper circuit parameters is important to com(cid:173) pensate for manufacturing deviations or adjust circuit performance within  a certain range. As biologically-motivated analog VLSI circuits become  increasingly complex, implying more parameters, setting these parameters  by hand will become more cumbersome. Thus an automated parameter  setting method can be of great value [Fleischer 90]. Automated parameter  setting is an integral part of a goal-based engineering design methodology  in which circuits are constructed with parameters enabling a wide range  of behaviors, and are then \"tuned\" to the desired behaviors automatically.",

Given a  first(cid:173) order-logic  knowledge  base and a  bound  k,  a  symmetric  network is  con(cid:173) structed  (like a  Boltzman  machine  or a  Hopfield  network)  that searches  for  a  proof for  a  given  query.  If a  resolution-based  proof of length  no  longer  than k  exists,  then the global  minima of the energy function  that  is  associated  with  the  network represent such  proofs.  The  network  that  is  generated  is  of size  cubic  in  the bound  k  and  linear in the  knowledge  size.  There are no restrictions on the type of logic  formulas  that can be  represented.  The network  is  inherently fault  tolerant and  can cope with  inconsistency and nonmonotonicity.",

A  contrast-dependent but spatially non-selective inhibitory component is also  found.  Stimulation with  ascending  and  descending  contrasts  reveals  the  latter  as  a  response  hysteresis  that  is  sensitive,  powerful  and  rapid,  sug(cid:173) gesting that it is  active in day-to-day vision.  Both forms of inhibition are  not  recurrent  but  are  rather  network  properties.  These  findings  suggest  two  fundamental  inhibitory mechanisms:  a  global mechanism that limits  dynamic range  and  creates  spatial selectivity  through  thresholding  and a  local mechanism that specifically refines  spatial filter  properties.

This  paper  argues  that  the  optimization  of  learning  rate,  the  number  of experimental  control  deci(cid:173) sions before adequate performance is obtained, and  robustness is of prime  importance-if necessary  at  the  expense  of computation  per  control  cy(cid:173) cle  and  memory  requirement.  This  is  motivated  by  the observation  that  a  robot  which  requires  two  thousand  learning  steps  to  achieve  adequate  performance, or a  robot  which occasionally gets stuck while learning,  will  always  be  undesirable,  whereas  moderate  computational  expense  can  be  accommodated by increasingly powerful computer hardware.  It is  not un(cid:173) reasonable  to assume  the  existence  of inexpensive  100  Mflop  controllers  within  a  few  years  and  so  even  processes  with  control  cycles  in  the  low  tens of milliseconds  will  have millions of machine instructions in  which to  make their decisions.

PARSEC is not based on formal  grammar systems and is geared toward spoken language tasks. PARSEC  networks exhibit three strengths important for application to speech pro(cid:173) cessing:  1) they learn to parse, and generalize well compared to hand(cid:173) coded grammars; 2) they tolerate several types of noise;  3)  they can  learn to use multi-modal input. Presented are the PARSEC architecture  and performance analyses along several dimensions that demonstrate  PARSEC's features. PARSEC's performance is compared to that of tra(cid:173) ditional grammar-based parsing systems.",

It was recently shown that adding a  momentum term ~w(t) = -7JdE/dw(t) + Q'~w(t - 1) improves this to  ~ VAmax/ Amin, although only in the batch case. Here we show that second(cid:173) order momentum, ~w(t) = -7JdE/dw(t) + Q'~w(t -1) + (3~w(t - 2), can  lower this no further. We then regard gradient descent with momentum  as a dynamic system and explore a non quadratic error surface, showing  that saturation of the error accounts for a variety of effects observed in  simulations and justifies some popular heuristics.",

        "abstract": "The two well known learning algorithms of recurrent neural networks are  the back-propagation (Rumelhart & el al.,  Werbos) and the  forward propa(cid:173) gation (Williams and Zipser). The main drawback of back-propagation is  its  off-line backward path in time for error cumulation. This violates the on-line  requirement in many  practical applications.  Although the  forward propaga(cid:173) tion algorithm can be used in an on-line manner, the annoying drawback is  the heavy computation load required to update the high dimensional sensitiv(cid:173) ity matrix (0( fir) operations for each time step). Therefore, to develop a fast  forward algorithm is a challenging task. In this paper w~ proposed a forward  learning algorithm which is one order faster (only 0(fV3) operations for each  time step) than the sensitivity matrix algorithm. The basic idea is that instead  of integrating  the  high  dimensional  sensitivity dynamic  equation  we  solve  forward in time for its Green's function to avoid the redundant computations,  and then update the weights whenever the error is to be corrected.",

A  scale  variation is built into the network  to deal with varying sizes.  This algo(cid:173) rithm  has  been  applied  to  video  images  of railroad  cars,  to  find  their  identification  numbers.  Over  95%  of  the  characlers  were  located  correctly in a data base of 300 images, despile a large variation in light(cid:173) ing  conditions and  often a poor quality of the characters.  A part of the  network  is executed  on  a processor board containing an  analog  neural  net chip (Graf et aI.  1991). while the rest is  implemented as  a software  model on a workstation or a digital signal processor.",

In RBF, a  new example is classified by computing its Euclidean distance to a set of  centers chosen by unsupervised methods. The application of supervised  learning to learn a non-Euclidean distance metric was found to reduce the  error rate of RBF networks, while supervised learning of each center's vari(cid:173) ance resulted in inferior performance. The best improvement in accuracy  was achieved by networks called generalized radial basis function (GRBF)  networks. In GRBF, the center locations are determined by supervised  learning. After training on 1000 words, RBF classifies 56.5% of letters  correct, while GRBF scores 73.4% letters correct (on a separate test set).  From these and other experiments, we conclude that supervised learning  of center locations can be very important for radial basis function learning.",

        "abstract": "Learning  structure  in  temporally-extended  sequences  is  a  difficult  com(cid:173) putational problem because  only a  fraction  of the relevant  information is  available  at  any  instant.  Although  variants  of back  propagation  can  in  principle  be  used  to find  structure in  sequences,  in  practice  they  are  not  sufficiently  powerful  to  discover  arbitrary  contingencies,  especially  those  spanning  long  temporal  intervals  or  involving  high  order  statistics.  For  example,  in  designing  a  connectionist  network for  music  composition,  we  have encountered  the problem that the net is  able to learn  musical struc(cid:173) ture that occurs locally in time-e.g., relations  among notes within a  mu(cid:173) sical phrase-but not structure that occurs over longer time periods--e.g.,  relations  among  phrases.  To  address  this  problem,  we  require  a  means  of constructing  a  reduced  deacription  of the  sequence  that  makes  global  aspects more explicit  or more readily detectable.  I propose to achieve this  using hidden  units that operate with different  time constants.  Simulation  experiments  indicate  that slower  time-scale  hidden  units  are  able  to pick  up global structure,  structure that simply can not be learned  by standard  back propagation.",

In  this  paper,  we  present  Information  Measure  Based  Skeletonisation  (IMBS),  a  new  approach  to  this  problem where  superfluous  hidden  units  are  removed  based  on  their  information measure (1M).  This measure,  borrowed from decision  tree  in(cid:173) duction  techniques,  reflects  the  degree  to  which  the  hyperplane  formed  by  a  hidden  unit  discriminates  between  training  data  classes.  We  show  the results of applying IMBS  to three classification tasks and demonstrate  that it removes a  substantial number of hidden  units without significantly  affecting  network performance.",

The semicircular canals  transduce head velocity in a linear manner by  using  a  high  background  discharge  rate,  imparting  linearity  to  the  premotor  circuits  that  generate  eye  movements.  This  has  allowed  deducing  some  of the  signal  processing  involved,  including  a  neural  network that integrates.  These  ideas  are  often  summarized  by block  diagrams.  Unfortunately,  they  are  of little  value  in  describing  the  behavior  of single  neurons  - a  fmding  supported  by  neural  network  models.",

        "abstract": "Learning a  map from an input set  to an output set is similar to the prob(cid:173) lem of reconstructing  hypersurfaces  from sparse  data (Poggio and  Girosi,  1990).  In this framework,  we  discuss  the  problem of automatically select(cid:173) ing  \"minimal\"  surface  data.  The objective  is  to be  able to approximately  reconstruct  the  surface  from the selected  sparse  data.  We  show  that this  problem is  equivalent  to  the  one  of compressing  information by  data re(cid:173) moval and the one oflearning how to teach.  Our key step is to introduce a  process  that statistically selects  the data according  to the  model.  During  the process  of data selection  (learning how  to teach)  our system  (teacher)  is  capable  of predicting  the  new  surface,  the  approximated  one  provided  by  the  selected  data.  We  concentrate  on  piecewise  smooth surfaces,  e.g.  images,  and  use  mean field  techniques  to  obtain a  deterministic  network  that is shown to compress  image data.",

Instead,  use  your sequence  learning  algorithm  (any will  do)  to implement  the  following  method  for  history  compression.  No  matter  what  your  fi(cid:173) nal goals  are,  train  a  network  to predict  its next input from  the  previous  ones.  Since  only  unpredictable  inputs  convey  new  information, ignore  all  predictable  inputs  but let  all  unexpected  inputs  (plus  information  about  the  time  step  at  which  they  occurred)  become  inputs  to  a  higher-level  network of the same kind  (working on a  slower,  self-adjusting  time scale).  Go on  building  a  hierarchy  of such  networks.  This  principle  reduces  the  descriptions  of event  sequences  without  1088  of information,  thus  easing  supervised  or  reinforcement  learning  tasks.  Alternatively,  you  may  use  two recurrent  networks  to collapse  a  multi-level  predictor hierarchy  into a  single  recurrent  net.  Experiments  show  that systems based on  these prin(cid:173) ciples  can require less  computation per  time step and many fewer  training  sequences  than conventional training algorithms for  recurrent  nets.

Examples of such networks are  those whose neural transfer functions are piecewise-linear and those whose error  function is defined in terms of the 100 norm.  Up to now, networks whose neural transfer functions are piecewise-linear have  received very little consideration in the literature, but the possibility of using an  error function defined in terms of the 100 norm has received some attention. In  this latter work, however, the problems that can occur when gradient methods are  used for non smooth error functions have not been addressed.  In this paper we draw upon some recent results from the field of nonsmooth  optimization (NSO) to present an algorithm for the non smooth case. Our moti(cid:173) vation for this work arose out of the fact that we have been able to show that,  in backpropagation, an error function based upon the 100 norm overcomes the  difficulties which can occur when using the 12 norm.",

They have been applied to the Travelling Salesman Problem (TSP), as  well as to various issues in computational vision and cluster analysis. I  show here that any given MFT algorithm can be combined in a natural  way with notions from the areas of constrained optimisation and adaptive  simulated annealing to yield a single homogenous and efficient parallel re(cid:173) laxation technique, for which an externally prescribed annealing schedule  is no longer required. The results of numerical simulations on 50-city and  100-city TSP problems are presented, which show that the ensuing algo(cid:173) rithms are typically an order of magnitude faster than the MFT algorithms  alone, and which also show, on occasion, superior solutions as well.",

In  contrast to this approach, we study here how the overall network activity  can control single cell parameters such as input resistance, as well as time  and space constants, parameters that are crucial for excitability and spatio(cid:173) temporal integration. Using detailed computer simulations of neocortical  pyramidal cells, we show that the spontaneous background firing of the  network provides a means for setting these parameters. The mechanism  for this control is through the large conductance change of the membrane  that is induced by both non-NMDA and NMDA excitatory and inhibitory  synapses activated by the spontaneous background activity.",

        "abstract": "An important issue in neural computation is the dynamic range of weights  in  the  neural  networks.  Many  experimental  results  on  learning  indicate  that  the  weights  in  the  networks  can  grow  prohibitively  large  with  the  size  of the  inputs.  Here  we  address  this  issue  by  studying  the  tradeoffs  between  the  depth  and  the  size  of weights  in  polynomial-size  networks  of linear  threshold  elements  (LTEs).  We  show  that  there  is  an  efficient  way  of simulating  a  network  of LTEs  with  large  weights  by  a  network  of LTEs  with  small weights.  In  particular,  we  prove  that  every  depth-d,  polynomial-size network  of LTEs  with  exponentially  large  integer  weights  can  be  simulated  by  a  depth-(2d + 1),  polynomial-size network  of LTEs  with  polynomially  bounded  integer  weights.  To  prove  these  results,  we  use  tools from  harmonic analysis of Boolean  functions.  Our  technique  is  quite  general,  it  provides  insights  to some other  problems.  For  example,  we  are  able to improve the  best  known  results  on  the  depth  of a  network  of linear  threshold  elements  that  computes the  COM PARI SO N,  SUM  and  PRO DU CT of two  n-bits  numbers,  and  the  MAX 1M U M  and  the  SORTING of n  n-bit numbers.",

        "abstract": "A constructive algorithm is proposed for feed-forward neural networks,  which uses node-splitting in the hidden layers to build large networks from  smaller ones. The small network forms an approximate model of a set of  training data, and the split creates a larger more powerful network which is  initialised with the approximate solution already found. The insufficiency  of the smaller network in modelling the system which generated the data  leads to oscillation in those hidden nodes whose weight vectors cover re(cid:173) gions in the input space where more detail is required in the model. These  nodes are identified and split in two using principal component analysis,  allowing the new nodes t.o cover the two main modes of each oscillating  vector. Nodes are selected for splitting using principal component analysis  on the oscillating weight vectors, or by examining the Hessian matrix of  second derivatives of the network error with respect to the weight.s. The  second derivat.ive method can also be applied to the input layer, where it  provides a useful indication of t.he relative import.ances of parameters for  the classification t.ask. Node splitting in a standard Multi Layer Percep(cid:173) t.ron is equivalent to introducing a hinge in the decision boundary to allow  more detail to be learned. Initial results were promising, but further eval(cid:173) uation indicates that the long range effects of decision boundaries cause  the new nodes to slip back to the old node position, and nothing is gained.  This problem does not occur in networks of localised receptive fields such  as radial basis functions or gaussian mixtures, where the t.echnique appears  to work well.",

As  the  vehicle  explores  its  surroundings it adapts  its  responses  to  sensory stimuli  so  as  to  minimise  the  negative  reinforcement  arising  from  collisions.

Simulations demonstrate that a  network can learn to represent three different functions simultaneously and  canonical discriminant analysis is used to investigate bow operators and curried  functions are represented in the space of bidden unit activations.",

They were  compared on three problems: prediction of Boston housing prices, the  sunspot count, and robot arm inverse dynamics. The complex units at(cid:173) tained clearly superior performance on the robot arm problem, which is  a highly non-monotonic, pure approximation problem. On the noisy and  only mildly nonlinear Boston housing and sunspot problems, differences  among the complex units were revealed; polynomials did poorly, whereas  rationals and flexible Fourier series were comparable to sigmoids.",

A number of important  practical issues are identified and discussed from a general theoretical per(cid:173) spective.  These practical issues are then examined in the context of a case  study  in  which  TO(')  is  applied  to  learning  the  game  of backgammon  from  the  outcome of self-play.  This is  apparently  the  first  application of  this  algorithm  to  a  complex  nontrivial  task.  It is  found  that,  with  zero  knowledge  built  in,  the network  is able  to learn  from  scratch  to  play  the  entire game at a  fairly strong intermediate level of performance,  which  is  clearly  better  than conventional commercial programs, and which  in fact  surpasses  comparable networks  trained  on  a  massive  human expert  data  set.  The hidden  units in  these network  have apparently discovered  useful  features,  a  longstanding  goal of computer  games  research.  Furthermore,  when  a  set  of hand-crafted  features  is  added  to the  input representation,  the resulting networks reach  a  near-expert  level of performance, and have  achieved good results against world-class human play.",

        "abstract": "The notion of generalization ability can be defined precisely as the pre(cid:173) diction risk, the expected performance of an estimator in predicting new  observations. In this paper, we propose the prediction risk as a measure  of the generalization ability of multi-layer perceptron networks and use it  to select an optimal network architecture from a set of possible architec(cid:173) tures. We also propose a heuristic search strategy to explore the space of  possible architectures. The prediction risk is estimated from the available  data; here we estimate the prediction risk by v-fold cross-validation and  by asymptotic approximations of generalized cross-validation or Akaike's  final prediction error. We apply the technique to the problem of predicting  corporate bond ratings. This problem is very attractive as a case study,  since it is characterized by the limited availability of the data and by the  lack of a complete a priori model which could be used to impose a structure  to the network architecture.",

One uses a backpropagation network that scans exhaus(cid:173) tively over a field of characters and is trained to recognize whether  it is centered over a single character or between characters. When  it is centered over a character, the net classifies the cnaracter. The  approach is tested on a dataset of hand-printed digits. Vel)' low errOr  rates are reported. The second version, COISR-SACCADE, avoids  the need for exhaustive scans.

Normal development depends upon activity in RGCs, suggesting a key  role for activity-dependent synaptic plasticity. Recent experiments on  prenatal retina show that during early development, \"waves\" of activity  pass across RGCs (Meister, et aI., 1991). We provide the first  simulations to demonstrate that such retinal waves, in conjunction with  Hebbian synaptic competition and early arrival of contralateral axons,  can account for observed patterns of retinogeniculate projections in  normal and experimentally-treated animals.",

Their  distribution within the membrane governs not only communication of in(cid:173) formation between neurons, but also how that information is integrated  within the cell. Here, an argument is presented for an 'anti-Hebbian' rule  for changing the distribution of voltage-dependent ion channels in order  to flatten voltage curvatures in dendrites. Simulations show that this rule  can account for the self-organisation of dynamical receptive field properties  such as resonance and direction selectivity. It also creates the conditions  for the faithful conduction within the cell of signals to which the cell has  been exposed. Various possible cellular implementations of such a learn(cid:173) ing rule are proposed, including activity-dependent migration of channel  proteins in the plane of the membrane.",

        "abstract": "We compare two strategies for training connectionist (as well as non(cid:173) connectionist) models for statistical pattern recognition. The probabilistic strat(cid:173) egy is based on the notion that Bayesian discrimination (i.e .\u2022 optimal classifica(cid:173) tion) is achieved when the classifier learns the a posteriori class distributions of  the random feature vector. The differential strategy is based on the notion that  the identity of the largest class a posteriori probability of the feature vector is  all that is needed to achieve Bayesian discrimination. Each strategy is directly  linked to a family of objective functions that can be used in the supervised training  procedure. We prove that the probabilistic strategy - linked with error measure  objective functions such as mean-squared-error and cross-entropy - typically  used to train classifiers necessarily requires larger training sets and more complex  classifier architectures than those needed to approximate the Bayesian discrim(cid:173) linked  inant function.  In contrast. we prove that the differential strategy - with classificationfigure-of-merit objective functions (CF'MmoIlO) [3] - requires  the minimum classifier functional complexity and the fewest training examples  necessary to approximate the Bayesian discriminant function with specified pre(cid:173) cision (measured in probability of error). We present our proofs in the context of  a game of chance in which an unfair C-sided die is tossed repeatedly. We show  that this rigged game of dice is a paradigm at the root of all statistical pattern  recognition tasks. and demonstrate how a simple extension of the concept leads  us to a general information-theoretic model of sample complexity for statistical  pattern recognition.",

With increasing noise intensity, the SNR passes  t.hrough a maximum, an effect which has been called stochastic resonance.

The data consist of spike trains from pairs of neurons responding  to brief tone bursts recorded in vivo. Our results suggest that the synaptic efficacy is  non-stationary. Further. synaptic efficacy is shown to be inversely and  approximately linearly related to average presynaptic spike rate. A second-order  analysis suggests that the latter result is not due to non-linear interactions. Synaptic  efficacy is less strongly correlated with postsynaptic rate and the correlation is not  consistent across neural pairs.",

This approach allows us to measure  the discriminability of similar stimuli, based on the real-time response of a  single neuron. Neurophysiological data were obtained from a movement(cid:173) sensitive neuron (HI) in the visual system of the blowfly Calliphom ery(cid:173) throcephala. Furthermore, recordings were made from blowfly photore(cid:173) ceptor cells to quantify the signal to noise ratios in the peripheral visual  system. As photoreceptors form the input to the visual system, the reli(cid:173) ability of their signals ultimately determines the reliability of any visual  discrimination task. For the case of movement detection, this limit can  be computed, and compared to the HI neuron's reliability. Under favor(cid:173) able conditions, the performance of the HI neuron closely approaches the  theoretical limit, which means that under these conditions the nervous  system adds little noise in the process of computing movement from the  correlations of signals in the photoreceptor array.",

For example, it is known in advance that the output  of a character recognizer should be invariant with respect to small spa(cid:173) tial distortions of the input images (translations, rotations, scale changes,  etcetera).  We have implemented a scheme that allows a network to learn the deriva(cid:173) tive of its outputs with respect to distortion operators of our choosing.  This not only reduces the learning time and the amount of training data,  but also provides a powerful language for specifying what generalizations  we wish the network to perform.",

We analyze the class of probability distributions that can be modeled by such machines.  showing that for each n ~ 1 this class includes arbitrarily good appwximations to any distribution  on the set of all n-vectors of binary inputs. We then present two learning algorithms for these  machines .. The first learning algorithm is the standard gradient ascent heuristic for computing  maximum likelihood estimates for the parameters (i.e. weights and thresholds) of the modeL Here  we give a closed form for this gradient that is significantly easier to compute than the corresponding  gradient for the general Boltzmann machine . The second learning algorithm is a greedy method  that creates the hidden units and computes their weights one at a time. This method is a variant  of the standard method for projection pursuit density estimation . We give experimental results for  these learning methods on synthetic data and natural data from the domain of handwritten digits.",
