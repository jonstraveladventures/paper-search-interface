        "abstract": "Signi\ufb01cant plasticity in sensory cortical representations can be driven in mature animals either by behavioural tasks that pair sensory stimuli with reinforcement, or by electrophysiological experiments that pair sensory input with direct stimulation of neuromodulatory nuclei, but usually not by sensory stimuli presented alone. Biologically motivated theories of representational learning, however, have tended to focus on unsupervised mechanisms, which may play a signi\ufb01cant role on evolutionary or devel- opmental timescales, but which neglect this essential role of reinforce- ment in adult plasticity. By contrast, theoretical reinforcement learning has generally dealt with the acquisition of optimal policies for action in an uncertain world, rather than with the concurrent shaping of sensory representations. This paper develops a framework for representational learning which builds on the relative success of unsupervised generative- modelling accounts of cortical encodings to incorporate the effects of reinforcement in a biologically plausible way.",

Any density measure D, dependent on the total count and total population of a re- gion, can be used. For example, if each count represents the number of disease cases occurring in that square, we can use Kulldorff\u2019s spatial scan statistic DK to \ufb01nd the most signi\ufb01cant spatial disease cluster. A naive approach to \ufb01nding the maximum density region requires O(N 3) time, and is generally computationally infeasible. We present a novel algorithm which partitions the grid into overlapping regions, bounds the maximum score of subregions contained in each region, and prunes re- gions which cannot contain the maximum density region. For suf\ufb01ciently dense regions, this method \ufb01nds the maximum density region in optimal O(N2) time, in practice resulting in signi\ufb01cant (10-200x) speedups.",

We focus on the \u201ccompositionality\u201d of semantics, a fundamental character- istic of human language, which is the ability to understand the meaning of a sentence as a combination of the meanings of words. We also pay much attention to the \u201cembodiment\u201d of a robot, which means that the robot should acquire semantics which matches its body, or sensory-motor system. The essential claim is that an embodied compositional semantic representation can be self-organized from generalized correspondences between sentences and behavioral patterns. This claim is examined and con\ufb01rmed through simple experiments in which a robot generates corre- sponding behaviors from unlearned sentences by analogy with the corre- spondences between learned sentences and behaviors.",

The Fisher Kernel and similar variants have been suggested as good ways to combine an underlying generative model in the feature space and discriminant classi\ufb01ers such as SVM\u2019s. In this paper we sug- gest an alternative procedure to the Fisher kernel for systematically \ufb01nd- ing kernel functions that naturally handle variable length sequence data in multimedia domains. In particular for domains such as speech and images we explore the use of kernel functions that take full advantage of well known probabilistic models such as Gaussian Mixtures and sin- gle full covariance Gaussian models. We derive a kernel distance based on the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence between generative models. In effect our approach combines the best of both generative and discrim- inative methods and replaces the standard SVM kernels. We perform experiments on speaker identi\ufb01cation/veri\ufb01cation and image classi\ufb01ca- tion tasks and show that these new kernels have the best performance in speaker veri\ufb01cation and mostly outperform the Fisher kernel based SVM\u2019s and the generative classi\ufb01ers in speaker identi\ufb01cation and image classi\ufb01cation.",

        "abstract": "We have designed and tested a single-chip analog VLSI sensor that  detects  imminent  collisions  by  measuring  radially  expansive  optic  flow.    The  design  of  the  chip  is  based  on  a  model  proposed  to  explain  leg-extension behavior in flies during  landing  approaches.   A new elementary motion detector (EMD) circuit was developed to  measure optic flow.  This EMD circuit models the bandpass nature  of  large  monopolar  cells  (LMCs)  immediately  postsynaptic  to  photoreceptors  in  the  fly  visual  system.    A  16  \u00d7  16  array  of  2-D  motion detectors was fabricated on a 2.24 mm \u00d7 2.24 mm die in a  standard  0.5-\u00b5m  CMOS  process.    The  chip  consumes  140  \u00b5W  of  power from a 5 V supply.  With the addition of wide-angle optics,  the sensor is able to detect collisions around 500 ms before impact  in complex, real-world scenes.",

A four-stage asynchronous median detection architec- ture  based  on  analog  digital  mixed-signal  circuits  has  been  intro- duced  to  determine  the  threshold  value  of  edge  detection,  the  key  processing  parameter  in  vector  generation.  As  a  result,  a  fully  seamless pipeline processing from threshold detection to edge fea- ture  map  generation  has  been  established.  A  prototype  chip  was  designed in a 0.35-\u00b5m double-polysilicon three-metal-layer CMOS  technology and the concept was verified by the fabricated chip. The  chip  generates  a  64-dimension  feature  vector  from  a  64x64-pixel  gray scale image every 80\u00b5sec. This is about 104 times faster than the  software computation, making a real-time image recognition system  feasible.",

We do this using a formalism that models the generation of annotated images. We assume that every image is di- vided into regions, each described by a continuous-valued feature vector. Given a training set of images with annotations, we compute a joint prob- abilistic model of image features and words which allow us to predict the probability of generating a word given the image regions. This may be used to automatically annotate and retrieve images given a word as a query. Experiments show that our model signi\ufb01cantly outperforms the best of the previously reported results on the tasks of automatic image annotation and retrieval.",

Here, we describe a neuromorphic implementation of a disparity selective com- plex cell using the binocular energy model, which has been proposed to model the response of disparity selective cells in the visual cortex. Our system consists of two silicon chips containing spiking neurons with monocular Gabor-type spatial receptive fields (RF) and circuits that combine the spike outputs to compute a disparity selective complex cell response. The disparity selectivity of the cell can be adjusted by both position and phase shifts between the monocular RF profiles, which are both used in biology. Our neuromorphic system performs better with phase encoding, because the relative responses of neurons tuned to dif- ferent disparities by phase shifts are better matched than the responses of neurons tuned by position shifts.",

One reason why this representation is exciting as an alternative to partially observable Markov decision processes (POMDPs) is that PSR models of dynamical systems may be much more compact than POMDP models. Empirical work on PSRs to date has focused on linear PSRs, which have not allowed for compression relative to POMDPs. We introduce a new notion of tests which allows us to de\ufb01ne a new type of PSR that is nonlinear in general and allows for exponential compression in some deterministic dynami- cal systems. These new tests, called e-tests, are related to the tests used by Rivest and Schapire [1] in their work with the diversity representation, but our PSR avoids some of the pitfalls of their representation\u2014in partic- ular, its potential to be exponentially larger than the equivalent POMDP.",

        "abstract": "Super-resolution aims to produce a high-resolution image from a set of one or more low-resolution images by recovering or inventing plausible high-frequency image content. Typical approaches try to reconstruct a high-resolution image using the sub-pixel displacements of several low- resolution images, usually regularized by a generic smoothness prior over the high-resolution image space. Other methods use training data to learn low-to-high-resolution matches, and have been highly successful even in the single-input-image case. Here we present a domain-speci\ufb01c im- age prior in the form of a p.d.f. based upon sampled images, and show that for certain types of super-resolution problems, this sample-based prior gives a signi\ufb01cant improvement over other common multiple-image super-resolution techniques.",

However, the objective function optimized in most of these algorithms is the error rate and not the AUC value. We give a detailed statistical analysis of the relationship between the AUC and the error rate, including the \ufb01rst exact expression of the expected value and the variance of the AUC for a \ufb01xed error rate. Our results show that the average AUC is monotonically in- creasing as a function of the classi\ufb01cation accuracy, but that the standard deviation for uneven distributions and higher error rates is noticeable. Thus, algorithms designed to minimize the error rate may not lead to the best possible AUC values. We show that, under certain conditions, the global function optimized by the RankBoost algorithm is exactly the AUC. We report the results of our experiments with RankBoost in several datasets demonstrating the bene\ufb01ts of an algorithm speci\ufb01cally designed to globally optimize the AUC over other existing algorithms optimizing an approximation of the AUC or only locally optimizing the AUC.",

In a Bayesian model-learning framework the answer depends on the prior ex- pectations of the dynamics of the model parameter that is to be inferred from the data. Local time constraints on the priors are insuf\ufb01cient to pick one interpretation over another. On the other hand, nonlocal time constraints, induced by a 1/f noise spectrum of the priors, is shown to permit learning of a speci\ufb01c model parameter even when there are in- \ufb01nitely many equally plausible interpretations of the data. This transition is inferred by a remarkable mapping of the model estimation problem to a dissipative physical system, allowing the use of powerful statisti- cal mechanical methods to uncover the transition from indeterminate to determinate model learning.",

The software is capable of acquiring consistent 2D maps of large mines with many cycles, represented as Markov random \u00a3elds. 3D C-space maps are acquired from local 3D range scans, which are used to identify navigable paths using A* search. Our system has been deployed in three abandoned mines, two of which inaccessible to people, where it has acquired maps of unprecedented detail and accuracy.",

        "abstract": "Consider a number of moving points, where each point is attached to a joint of the human body and projected onto an image plane. Johannson showed that humans can e\ufb00ortlessly detect and recog- nize the presence of other humans from such displays. This is true even when some of the body points are missing (e.g. because of occlusion) and unrelated clutter points are added to the display. We are interested in replicating this ability in a machine. To this end, we present a labelling and detection scheme in a probabilistic framework. Our method is based on representing the joint prob- ability density of positions and velocities of body points with a graphical model, and using Loopy Belief Propagation to calculate a likely interpretation of the scene. Furthermore, we introduce a global variable representing the body\u2019s centroid. Experiments on one motion-captured sequence suggest that our scheme improves on the accuracy of a previous approach based on triangulated graph- ical models, especially when very few parts are visible. The im- provement is due both to the more general graph structure we use and, more signi\ufb01cantly, to the introduction of the centroid variable.",

These methods can be considered as natural extensions to binary large margin classi\ufb01cation.

Examples are provided for two speci\ufb01c forms of the general formulation, which extend a number of known methods. Using these examples, we show that some risk minimization formulations can also be used to ob- tain conditional probability estimates for the underlying problem. Such conditional probability information will be useful for statistical inferenc- ing tasks beyond classi\ufb01cation.",

        "abstract": "Spike timing plasticity (STDP) is a special form of synaptic plasticity where the relative timing of post- and presynaptic activity determines the change of the synaptic weight. On the postsynaptic side, active back- propagating spikes in dendrites seem to play a crucial role in the induc- tion of spike timing dependent plasticity. We argue that postsynaptically the temporal change of the membrane potential determines the weight change. Coming from the presynaptic side induction of STDP is closely related to the activation of NMDA channels. Therefore, we will calculate analytically the change of the synaptic weight by correlating the deriva- tive of the membrane potential with the activity of the NMDA channel. Thus, for this calculation we utilise biophysical variables of the physi- ological cell. The \ufb01nal result shows a weight change curve which con- forms with measurements from biology. The positive part of the weight change curve is determined by the NMDA activation. The negative part of the weight change curve is determined by the membrane potential change. Therefore, the weight change curve should change its shape de- pending on the distance from the soma of the postsynaptic cell. We \ufb01nd temporally asymmetric weight change close to the soma and temporally symmetric weight change in the distal dendrite.",

We show how the method of one-class classi\ufb01cation with sup- port vector machines (SVMs) can be applied to solve these tasks satisfac- torily using the limited hardware capacity of the prescribed Sony AIBO quadruped robots. The experimental evaluation shows an improvement over our previous methods of ellipse \ufb01tting for colour classi\ufb01cation and the statistical approach used for collision detection.",

These approaches operate on sets of belief points by individ- ually learning a value function for each point. In reality, belief points exist in a highly-structured metric simplex, but current POMDP algo- rithms do not exploit this property. This paper presents a new metric-tree algorithm which can be used in the context of POMDP planning to sort belief points spatially, and then perform fast value function updates over groups of points. We present results showing that this approach can re- duce computation in point-based POMDP algorithms for a wide range of problems.",

To cope with these problems we represent the 3D human body as a graphical model in which the relationships between the body parts are represented by conditional probability distributions. We formulate the pose estimation problem as one of probabilistic inference over a graphi- cal model where the random variables correspond to the individual limb parameters (position and orientation). Because the limbs are described by 6-dimensional vectors encoding pose in 3-space, discretization is im- practical and the random variables in our model must be continuous- valued. To approximate belief propagation in such a graph we exploit a recently introduced generalization of the particle \ufb01lter. This framework facilitates the automatic initialization of the body-model from low level cues and is robust to occlusion of body parts and scene clutter.",

Two lines of research in particular have generated inter- est: the solution of large, weakly coupled MDPs, and the design and im- plementation of market architectures. We propose a new algorithm which joins together these two lines of research. For a class of coupled MDPs, our algorithm automatically designs a market architecture which causes a decentralized multi-robot system to converge to a consistent policy. We can show that this policy is the same as the one which would be produced by a particular centralized planning algorithm. We demonstrate the new algorithm on three simulation examples: multi-robot towing, multi-robot path planning with a limited fuel resource, and coordinating behaviors in a game of paint ball.",

Our experiments with arti\ufb01cial and real- world data demonstrate that the graphs learned from bootstrap samples can be severely biased towards too complex graphical mod- els. Accounting for this bias is hence essential, e.g., when explor- ing model uncertainty. We \ufb01nd that this bias is intimately tied to (well-known) spurious dependences induced by the bootstrap. The leading-order bias-correction equals one half of Akaike\u2019s penalty for model complexity. We demonstrate the e\ufb00ect of this simple bias-correction in our experiments. We also relate this bias to the bias of the plug-in estimator for entropy, as well as to the di\ufb00er- ence between the expected test and training errors of a graphical model, which asymptotically equals Akaike\u2019s penalty (rather than one half).",

In particular, for any set of m labeled examples consistent with a disjunction of k literals (which are one-sided in this case), AdaBoost constructs a consistent hypothesis by using O(k2 log m) iterations. On the other hand, a greedy set covering algorithm \ufb01nds a consistent hypothesis of size O(k log m). Our primary question is whether there is a simple boosting algorithm that performs as well as the greedy set covering. We \ufb01rst show that InfoBoost, a modi\ufb01cation of AdaBoost pro- posed by Aslam for a di\ufb00erent purpose, does perform as well as the greedy set covering algorithm. We then show that AdaBoost requires \u2126(k2 log m) iterations for learning k-literal disjunctions. We achieve this with an adversary construction and as well as in simple experiments based on arti\ufb01cial data. Further we give a vari- ant called SemiBoost that can handle the degenerate case when the given examples all have the same label. We conclude by showing that SemiBoost can be used to produce small conjunctions as well.",

Our analysis is based on the behavior of a simulated robot in a virtual environment containing speci(cid:12)c visual cues.

Here, we used an optimization algorithm to search for patterns of connectivity suf\ufb01- cient to compute the sensorimotor transformation underlying C. elegans chemotaxis, a simple form of spatial orientation behavior in which turn- ing probability is modulated by the rate of change of chemical concen- tration. Optimization produced differentiator networks with inhibitory feedback among all neurons. Further analysis showed that feedback reg- ulates the latency between sensory input and behavior. Common patterns of connectivity between the model and biological networks suggest new functions for previously identi\ufb01ed connections in the C. elegans nervous system.",

This paper describes a hybrid model in which a high-dimensional subset of the parameters are trained to maximize generative likelihood, and another, small, subset of parameters are discriminatively trained to maximize conditional likelihood. We give a sample complexity bound showing that in order to \ufb01t the discriminative parameters well, the num- ber of training examples required depends only on the logarithm of the number of feature occurrences and feature set size. Experimental results show that hybrid models can provide lower test error and can produce better accuracy/coverage curves than either their purely generative or purely discriminative counterparts. We also discuss several advantages of hybrid models, and advocate further work in this area.",

While the prob- lem of \ufb01nding compact clusters has been widely studied in the litera- ture, extracting arbitrarily formed elongated structures is considered a much harder problem. In this paper we present a novel clustering algo- rithm which tackles the problem by a two step procedure: \ufb01rst the data are transformed in such a way that elongated structures become compact ones. In a second step, these new objects are clustered by optimizing a compactness-based criterion. The advantages of the method over related approaches are threefold: (i) robustness properties of compactness-based criteria naturally transfer to the problem of extracting elongated struc- tures, leading to a model which is highly robust against outlier objects; (ii) the transformed distances induce a Mercer kernel which allows us to formulate a polynomial approximation scheme to the generally NP- hard clustering problem; (iii) the new method does not contain free kernel parameters in contrast to methods like spectral clustering or mean-shift clustering.",

We develop a framework to incorporate side information in the form of equivalence constraints into the model estimation procedure. Equivalence constraints are de\ufb01ned on pairs of data points, indicating whether the points arise from the same source (positive constraints) or from different sources (negative con- straints). Such constraints can be gathered automatically in some learn- ing problems, and are a natural form of supervision in others. For the estimation of model parameters we present a closed form EM procedure which handles positive constraints, and a Generalized EM procedure us- ing a Markov net which handles negative constraints. Using publicly available data sets we demonstrate that such side information can lead to considerable improvement in clustering tasks, and that our algorithm is preferable to two other suggested methods using the same type of side information.",

        "abstract": "The 2-class transduction problem, as formulated by Vapnik [1], involves \ufb01nding a separating hyperplane for a labelled data set that is also maximally distant from a given set of unlabelled test points. In this form, the problem has exponential computational complexity in the size of the working set. So far it has been attacked by means of integer programming techniques [2] that do not scale to reasonable problem sizes, or by local search procedures [3]. In this paper we present a relaxation of this task based on semi- de\ufb01nite programming (SDP), resulting in a convex optimization problem that has polynomial complexity in the size of the data set. The results are very encouraging for mid sized data sets, however the cost is still too high for large scale problems, due to the high di- mensional search space. To this end, we restrict the feasible region by introducing an approximation based on solving an eigenproblem. With this approximation, the computational cost of the algorithm is such that problems with more than 1000 points can be treated.",

In this study, we develop a method based on Bayesian sequential updating and the particle \ufb01ltering algorithm to decode the activity of V1 neurons in awake monkeys. A distinction in our method is the use of Volterra ker- nels to \ufb01lter the particles, which live in a high dimensional space. This parametric Bayesian decoding scheme is compared to the optimal linear decoder and is shown to work consistently better than the linear optimal decoder. Interestingly, our results suggest that for decoding in real time, spike trains of as few as 10 independent but similar neurons would be suf\ufb01cient for decoding a critical scene variable in a particular class of visual stimuli. The reconstructed variable can predict the neural activity about as well as the actual signal with respect to the Volterra kernels.",

Our point of view is Bayesian and information-theoretic: on any given trial, we want to adaptively choose the input in such a way that the mutual in- formation between the (unknown) state of the system and the (stochastic) output is maximal, given any prior information (including data collected on any previous trials). We prove a theorem that quanti\ufb01es the effective- ness of this strategy and give a few illustrative examples comparing the performance of this adaptive technique to that of the more usual nonadap- tive experimental design. For example, we are able to explicitly calculate the asymptotic relative ef\ufb01ciency of the \u201cstaircase method\u201d widely em- ployed in psychophysics research, and to demonstrate the dependence of this ef\ufb01ciency on the form of the \u201cpsychometric function\u201d underlying the output responses.",

The parameters of the DRF model are learned using penalized maximum pseudo-likelihood method. Furthermore, the form of the DRF model allows the MAP inference for binary classi\ufb01ca- tion problems using the graph min-cut algorithms.

This protocol requires only local communication and simple computa- tions which are distributed among devices. The protocol is scalable to large networks. As a motivating example, we discuss a problem involv- ing optimization of power consumption, delay, and buffer over\ufb02ow in a sensor network. Our approach builds on policy gradient methods for optimization of Markov decision processes. The protocol can be viewed as an extension of policy gradient methods to a context involving a team of agents op- timizing aggregate performance through asynchronous distributed com- munication and computation. We establish that the dynamics of the pro- tocol approximate the solution to an ordinary differential equation that follows the gradient of the performance objective.",

        "abstract": "Dopamine exerts two classes of effect on the sustained neural activity in prefrontal cortex that underlies working memory. Direct release in the cortex increases the contrast of prefrontal neurons, enhancing the ro- bustness of storage. Release of dopamine in the striatum is associated with salient stimuli and makes medium spiny neurons bistable; this mod- ulation of the output of spiny neurons affects prefrontal cortex so as to indirectly gate access to working memory and additionally damp sensi- tivity to noise. Existing models have treated dopamine in one or other structure, or have addressed basal ganglia gating of working memory ex- clusive of dopamine effects. In this paper we combine these mechanisms and explore their joint effect. We model a memory-guided saccade task to illustrate how dopamine\u2019s actions lead to working memory that is se- lective for salient input and has increased robustness to distraction.",

This paper develops two multiscale algorithms for sampling from a product of Gaussian mixtures, and compares their performance to existing methods. The \ufb01rst is a multiscale variant of pre- viously proposed Monte Carlo techniques, with comparable theoretical guarantees but improved empirical convergence rates. The second makes use of approximate kernel density evaluation methods to construct a fast approximate sampler, which is guaranteed to sample points to within a tunable parameter (cid:15) of their true probability. We compare both multi- scale samplers on a set of computational examples motivated by NBP, demonstrating signi\ufb01cant improvements over existing methods.",

This new criterion is general in the sense that, when combined with a suitable constraint, it can actually give rise to the most popular feature extractor in the literature, linear discriminate analysis (LDA). We derive a new feature extractor based on MMC using a different constraint that does not depend on the nonsingularity of the within-class scatter matrix Sw. Such a dependence is a major drawback of LDA especially when the sample size is small. The kernelized (nonlin- ear) counterpart of this linear feature extractor is also established in this paper. Our preliminary experimental results on face images demonstrate that the new feature extractors are ef\ufb01cient and stable.",

At the heart of the method is principal component analysis (PCA) employed to \ufb01nd the most im- portant eigenvoices. In this paper, we postulate that nonlinear PCA, in particular kernel PCA, may be even more effective. One major challenge is to map the feature-space eigenvoices back to the observation space so that the state observation likelihoods can be computed during the estima- tion of eigenvoice weights and subsequent decoding. Our solution is to compute kernel PCA using composite kernels, and we will call our new method kernel eigenvoice speaker adaptation. On the TIDIGITS corpus, we found that compared with a speaker-independent model, our kernel eigenvoice adaptation method can reduce the word error rate by 28\u201333% while the standard eigenvoice approach can only match the performance of the speaker-independent model.",

Indeed, almost all in- teresting sequential decision-making domains involve large state spaces and large, stochastic action sets. We investigate a way to act intelli- gently as quickly as possible in domains where \ufb01nding a complete policy would take a hopelessly long time. This approach, Relational Envelope- based Planning (REBP) tackles large, noisy problems along two axes. First, describing a domain as a relational MDP (instead of as an atomic or propositionally-factored MDP) allows problem structure and dynam- ics to be captured compactly with a small set of probabilistic, relational rules. Second, an envelope-based approach to planning lets an agent be- gin acting quickly within a restricted part of the full state space and to judiciously expand its envelope as resources permit.",

This paper proposes a fundamentally different approach, dubbed \u201cHyper-Q\u201d Learning, in which values of mixed strategies rather than base actions are learned, and in which other agents\u2019 strategies are estimated from observed actions via Bayesian in- ference. Hyper-Q may be effective against many different types of adap- tive agents, even if they are persistently dynamic. Against certain broad categories of adaptation, it is argued that Hyper-Q may converge to ex- act optimal time-varying policies. In tests using Rock-Paper-Scissors, Hyper-Q learns to significantly exploit an Infinitesimal Gradient Ascent (IGA) player, as well as a Policy Hill Climber (PHC) player. Preliminary analysis of Hyper-Q against itself is also presented.",

Minor components analysis (MCA) is less well known, but can also play an important role in the presence of constraints on the data distribution. In this paper we present a probabilistic model for \u201cextreme components analysis\u201d (XCA) which at the maximum likelihood solution extracts an optimal combina- tion of principal and minor components. For a given number of compo- nents, the log-likelihood of the XCA model is guaranteed to be larger or equal than that of the probabilistic models for PCA and MCA. We de- scribe an ef\ufb01cient algorithm to solve for the globally optimal solution. For log-convex spectra we prove that the solution consists of principal components only, while for log-concave spectra the solution consists of minor components. In general, the solution admits a combination of both. In experiments we explore the properties of XCA on some synthetic and real-world datasets.",

The \u201cdynamic\u201d theory of vi- sion [1, 2] states that eye-movements can improve hyperacuity. Accord- ing to this theory, eye movements are thought to create variable spatial excitation patterns on the photoreceptor grid, which will allow for better spatiotemporal summation at later stages. We reexamine this theory us- ing a realistic model of the vertebrate retina by comparing responses of a resting and a moving eye. The performance of simulated ganglion cells in a hyperacuity task is evaluated by ideal observer analysis. We \ufb01nd that in the central retina eye-micromovements have no effect on the perfor- mance. Here optical blurring limits vernier acuity. In the retinal periph- ery however, eye-micromovements clearly improve performance. Based on ROC analysis, our predictions are quantitatively testable in electro- physiological and psychophysical experiments.",

        "abstract": "The problem of \\Structure From Motion\" is a central problem in vision: given the 2D locations of certain points we wish to recover the camera motion and the 3D coordinates of the points. Un- der simpli\ufb02ed camera models, the problem reduces to factorizing a measurement matrix into the product of two low rank matrices. Each element of the measurement matrix contains the position of a point in a particular image. When all elements are observed, the problem can be solved trivially using SVD, but in any realistic sit- uation many elements of the matrix are missing and the ones that are observed have a di\ufb01erent directional uncertainty. Under these conditions, most existing factorization algorithms fail while human perception is relatively unchanged. In this paper we use the well known EM algorithm for factor analy- sis to perform factorization. This allows us to easily handle missing data and measurement uncertainty and more importantly allows us to place a prior on the temporal trajectory of the latent variables (the camera position). We show that incorporating this prior gives a signi\ufb02cant improvement in performance in challenging image se- quences.",

Once vertices are assigned locations in a Euclidean space, the locations can be used to browse music and to generate playlists. MDS on very large sparse graphs can be effectively performed by a family of algorithms called Rectangular Dijsktra (RD) MDS algorithms. These RD algorithms operate on a dense rectangular slice of the distance matrix, created by calling Dijsktra a constant number of times. Two RD algorithms are compared: Landmark MDS, which uses the Nystr(cid:246)m ap- proximation to perform MDS; and a new algorithm called Fast Sparse Embedding, which uses FastMap. These algorithms compare favorably to Laplacian Eigenmaps, both in terms of speed and embedding quality.",

Our algorithms are fast and easy to implement, since they center on an incremental (large margin) algorithm which allows us to avoid linear, quadratic or higher-order programming methods.

In applications ranging from protein folding to image analysis one would like to \ufb02nd not just the best con\ufb02guration but rather the top M . While this problem has been solved using the junction tree formalism, in many real world prob- lems the clique size in the junction tree is prohibitively large. In this work we address the problem of \ufb02nding the M best con\ufb02gura- tions when exact inference is impossible. We start by developing a new exact inference algorithm for calculat- ing the best con\ufb02gurations that uses only max-marginals. For ap- proximate inference, we replace the max-marginals with the beliefs calculated using max-product BP and generalized BP. We show em- pirically that the algorithm can accurately and rapidly approximate the M best con\ufb02gurations in graphs with hundreds of variables.",

Inspired by the mathe- matical definition of randomness given by Kolmogorov complexity, we characterize regularity in terms of a hierarchy of automata that augment a finite controller with different forms of memory. We find that the reg- ularities detected in binary sequences depend upon presentation format, and that the kinds of automata that can identify these regularities are in- formative about the cognitive processes engaged by different formats.",

        "abstract": "In this article, we present a novel approach to solving the localization problem in cellular networks. The goal is to estimate a mobile user\u2019s position, based on measurements of the signal strengths received from network base stations. Our solution works by building Gaussian process models for the distribution of signal strengths, as obtained in a series of calibration measurements. In the localization stage, the user\u2019s posi- tion can be estimated by maximizing the likelihood of received signal strengths with respect to the position. We investigate the accuracy of the proposed approach on data obtained within a large indoor cellular network.",

Our formulation interprets PCA as a particular Gaussian process prior on a mapping from a latent space to the observed data-space. We show that if the prior\u2019s covariance func- tion constrains the mappings to be linear the model is equivalent to PCA, we then extend the model by considering less restrictive covariance func- tions which allow non-linear mappings. This more general Gaussian pro- cess latent variable model (GPLVM) is then evaluated as an approach to the visualisation of high dimensional data for three different data-sets. Additionally our non-linear algorithm can be further kernelised leading to \u2018twin kernel PCA\u2019 in which a mapping between feature spaces occurs.",

We demonstrate how the GP model allows evaluation of the value function in closed form. The resulting policy iteration algorithm is demonstrated on a simple problem with a two dimensional state space. Further, we speculate that the intrinsic ability of GP models to charac- terise distributions of functions would allow the method to capture entire distributions over future values instead of merely their expectation, which has traditionally been the focus of much of reinforcement learning.",

The model is speci\ufb01cally tailored to gene expression time course data. Each func- tional cluster center is a nonlinear combination of solutions of a simple linear differential equation that describes the change of individual mRNA levels when the synthesis and decay rates are constant. The mixture of continuous time parametric functional forms allows one to (a) account for the heterogeneity in the observed pro\ufb01les, (b) align the pro\ufb01les in time by estimating real-valued time shifts, (c) capture the synthesis and decay of mRNA in the course of an experiment, and (d) regularize noisy pro\ufb01les by enforcing smoothness in the mean curves. We derive an EM algo- rithm for estimating the parameters of the model, and apply the proposed approach to the set of cycling genes in yeast. The experiments show consistent improvement in predictive power and within cluster variance compared to regular Gaussian mixtures.",

However there are many situations where doing fast Fourier transforms without complete data would be desirable. In this pa- per it is recognised that formulating the FFT algorithm as a belief network allows suitable priors to be set for the Fourier coe(cid:14)cients. Furthermore e(cid:14)cient generalised belief propagation methods be- tween clusters of four nodes enable the Fourier coe(cid:14)cients to be inferred and the missing data to be estimated in near to O(n log n) time, where n is the total of the given and missing data points. This method is compared with a number of common approaches such as setting missing data to zero or to interpolation. It is tested on generated data and for a Fourier analysis of a damaged audio signal.",

The model selection problem in this domain is daunting\u2014which of the large collection of possible trees to use? We take a Bayesian approach, gen- erating an appropriate prior via a distribution on partitions that we refer to as the nested Chinese restaurant process. This nonparametric prior al- lows arbitrarily large branching factors and readily accommodates grow- ing data collections. We build a hierarchical topic model by combining this prior with a likelihood that is based on a hierarchical variant of latent Dirichlet allocation. We illustrate our approach on simulated data and with an application to the modeling of NIPS abstracts.",

        "abstract": "The so-called \u201cexperts algorithms\u201d constitute a methodology for choos- ing actions repeatedly, when the rewards depend both on the choice of action and on the unknown current state of the environment. An experts algorithm has access to a set of strategies (\u201cexperts\u201d), each of which may recommend which action to choose. The algorithm learns how to com- bine the recommendations of individual experts so that, in the long run, for any \ufb01xed sequence of states of the environment, it does as well as the best expert would have done relative to the same sequence. This method- ology may not be suitable for situations where the evolution of states of the environment depends on past chosen actions, as is usually the case, for example, in a repeated non-zero-sum game. A new experts algorithm is presented and analyzed in the context of re- peated games. It is shown that asymptotically, under certain conditions, it performs as well as the best available expert. This algorithm is quite different from previously proposed experts algorithms. It represents a shift from the paradigms of regret minimization and myopic optimiza- tion to consideration of the long-term effect of a player\u2019s actions on the opponent\u2019s actions or the environment. The importance of this shift is demonstrated by the fact that this algorithm is capable of inducing co- operation in the repeated Prisoner\u2019s Dilemma game, whereas previous experts algorithms converge to the suboptimal non-cooperative play.",

The target curves are sam- pled from a generative model which speci\ufb01es (probabilistically) the ge- ometry and local intensity properties of the curve. The ideal observer performs Bayesian inference on the generative model using MAP esti- mation. Varying the probability model for the curve geometry enables us investigate whether human performance is best for target curves that obey speci\ufb01c shape statistics, in particular those observed on natural shapes. Experiments are performed with data on both rectangular and hexagonal lattices. Our results show that human observers\u2019 performance approaches that of the ideal observer and are, in general, closest to the ideal for con- ditions where the target curve tends to be straight or similar to natural statistics on curves. This suggests a bias of human observers towards straight curves and natural statistics.",

However, a major drawback of this method is that all pixels are updated by the projection, even when only a few pixels are corrupted by noise or occlusion. We pro- pose a new method to identify the noisy pixels by (cid:1) 1-norm penalization and update the identi\ufb01ed pixels only. The identi\ufb01cation and updating of noisy pixels are formulated as one linear program which can be solved ef\ufb01ciently. Especially, one can apply the \u03bd-trick to directly specify the fraction of pixels to be reconstructed. Moreover, we extend the linear program to be able to exploit prior knowledge that occlusions often ap- pear in contiguous blocks (e.g. sunglasses on faces). The basic idea is to penalize boundary points and interior points of the occluded area dif- ferently. We are able to show the \u03bd-property also for this extended LP leading a method which is easy to use. Experimental results impressively demonstrate the power of our approach.",

        "abstract": "Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCI) are an interesting emerging technology that is driven by the motivation to develop an effective communication in- terface translating human intentions into a control signal for devices like computers or neuroprostheses. If this can be done bypassing the usual hu- man output pathways like peripheral nerves and muscles it can ultimately become a valuable tool for paralyzed patients. Most activity in BCI re- search is devoted to \ufb01nding suitable features and algorithms to increase information transfer rates (ITRs). The present paper studies the implica- tions of using more classes, e.g., left vs. right hand vs. foot, for operating a BCI. We contribute by (1) a theoretical study showing under some mild assumptions that it is practically not useful to employ more than three or four classes, (2) two extensions of the common spatial pattern (CSP) algorithm, one interestingly based on simultaneous diagonalization, and (3) controlled EEG experiments that underline our theoretical \ufb01ndings and show excellent improved ITRs.",

This method updates all states in the sequence simultaneously using an embedded Hidden Markov Model (HMM). An update begins with the creation of \u201cpools\u201d of candidate states at each time. We then de\ufb01ne an embedded HMM whose states are indexes within these pools. Using a forward-backward dynamic programming algo- rithm, we can ef\ufb01ciently choose a state sequence with the appropriate probabilities from the exponentially large number of state sequences that pass through states in these pools. We illustrate the method in a simple one-dimensional example, and in an example showing how an embed- ded HMM can be used to in effect discretize the state space without any discretization error. We also compare the embedded HMM to a particle smoother on a more substantial problem of inferring human motion from 2D traces of markers.",

An interesting question addressed in the current work is the extension of these ideas to obtain continuous representations that preserve relevant information, rather than dis- crete clusters. We give a formal de\ufb02nition of the general continuous IB problem and obtain an analytic solution for the optimal repre- sentation for the important case of multivariate Gaussian variables. The obtained optimal representation is a noisy linear projection to eigenvectors of the normalized correlation matrix \u00a7xjy\u00a7\u00a11 x , which is also the basis obtained in Canonical Correlation Analysis. How- ever, in Gaussian IB, the compression tradeo\ufb01 parameter uniquely determines the dimension, as well as the scale of each eigenvector. This introduces a novel interpretation where solutions of di\ufb01erent ranks lie on a continuum parametrized by the compression level. Our analysis also provides an analytic expression for the optimal tradeo\ufb01 - the information curve - in terms of the eigenvalue spec- trum.",

Frontal views of human faces were used for a gender classi\ufb01cation task. Human subjects classi- \ufb01ed the faces and their gender judgment, reaction time and con\ufb01dence rating were recorded. Several hyperplane learning algorithms were used on the same classi\ufb01cation task using the Principal Components of the texture and shape representation of the faces. The classi\ufb01cation perfor- mance of the learning algorithms was estimated using the face database with the true gender of the faces as labels, and also with the gender es- timated by the subjects. We then correlated the human responses to the distance of the stimuli to the separating hyperplane of the learning algo- rithms. Our results suggest that human classi\ufb01cation can be modeled by some hyperplane algorithms in the feature space we used. For classi\ufb01ca- tion, the brain needs more processing for stimuli close to that hyperplane than for those further away.",

The solution is found to be sparse in dual variables and allows to identify those points on the trajectory with minimal real-valued output as virtual support vec- tors. Extensions to segments of trajectories, to more than one trans- formation parameter, and to learning with kernels are discussed. In experiments we use a Taylor expansion to locally approximate rota- tional invariance in pixel images from USPS and \ufb01nd improvements over known methods.",

In contrast, we show that an appropriately implemented iterative batch-mode (or block-mode) learning method can be much faster. For example, it is three times faster in the UCI letter classi\ufb01cation problem (26 outputs, 16,000 data items, 6,066 parameters with a two-hidden-layer multilayer perceptron) and 353 times faster in a nonlinear regression problem arising in color recipe prediction (10 outputs, 1,000 data items, 2,210 parameters with a neuro-fuzzy modular network). The three principal innovative ingredients in our algorithm are the following: First, we use scaled trust-region regularization with inner-outer it- eration to solve the associated \u201coverdetermined\u201d nonlinear least squares problem, where the inner iteration performs a truncated (or inexact) Newton method. Second, we employ Pearlmutter\u2019s implicit sparse Hessian matrix-vector multiply algorithm to con- struct the Krylov subspaces used to solve for the truncated New- ton update. Third, we exploit sparsity (for preconditioning) in the matrices resulting from the NNs having many outputs.",

Given a regression or classi\ufb01cation problem in which we wish to predict a variable Y from an explanatory vector X, we treat the prob- lem of dimensionality reduction as that of \ufb01nding a low-dimensional \u201cef- fective subspace\u201d of X which retains the statistical relationship between X and Y . We show that this problem can be formulated in terms of conditional independence. To turn this formulation into an optimization problem, we characterize the notion of conditional independence using covariance operators on reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces; this allows us to derive a contrast function for estimation of the effective subspace. Un- like many conventional methods, the proposed method requires neither assumptions on the marginal distribution of X, nor a parametric model of the conditional distribution of Y .",

        "abstract": "This paper devises a novel kernel function for structured natural language data. In the \ufb01eld of Natural Language Processing, feature extraction consists of the following two steps: (1) syntactically and semantically analyzing raw data, i.e., character strings, then representing the results as discrete structures, such as parse trees and dependency graphs with part-of-speech tags; (2) creating (possibly high-dimensional) numerical feature vectors from the discrete structures. The new kernels, called Hier- archical Directed Acyclic Graph (HDAG) kernels, directly accept DAGs whose nodes can contain DAGs. HDAG data structures are needed to fully re\ufb02ect the syntactic and semantic structures that natural language data inherently have. In this paper, we de\ufb01ne the kernel function and show how it permits ef\ufb01cient calculation. Experiments demonstrate that the proposed kernels are superior to existing kernel functions, e.g., se- quence kernels, tree kernels, and bag-of-words kernels.",

The relationship is based on a variational transformation of the loss function that is easy to compute in many applications.

Based on the analysis, we also introduce a generalized family of Bayesian posteriors, and show that the convergence behavior of these generalized posteriors is completely determined by the local prior structure around the true distri- bution. This important and surprising robustness property does not hold for the standard Bayesian posterior in that it may not concentrate when there exist \u201cbad\u201d prior structures even at places far away from the true distribution.",

We model shape motion as a rigid component (rotation and translation) combined with a non-rigid deformation. Reconstruction is ill-posed if arbitrary deforma- tions are allowed. We constrain the problem by assuming that the object shape at each time instant is drawn from a Gaussian distribution. Based on this assumption, the algorithm simultaneously estimates 3D shape and motion for each time frame, learns the parameters of the Gaussian, and robustly \ufb01lls-in missing data points. We then extend the algorithm to model temporal smoothness in object shape, thus allowing it to handle severe cases of missing data.",

In this paper, we derive a new cost function for spectral clustering based on a measure of error between a given partition and a solution of the spectral relaxation of a minimum normalized cut problem. Minimizing this cost function with respect to the partition leads to a new spectral clustering algorithm. Minimizing with respect to the similarity matrix leads to an algorithm for learning the similarity matrix. We develop a tractable approximation of our cost function that is based on the power method of computing eigenvectors.",

Out of millions of face-sized windows in an input image, for ex- ample, only a few will typically contain a face. Viola and Jones recently proposed a cascade architecture for face detection which successfully ad- dresses the rare event nature of the task. A central part of their method is a feature selection algorithm based on AdaBoost. We present a novel cascade learning algorithm based on forward feature selection which is two orders of magnitude faster than the Viola-Jones approach and yields classi\ufb01ers of equivalent quality. This faster method could be used for more demanding classi\ufb01cation tasks, such as on-line learning.",

        "abstract": "When clustering a dataset, the right number k of clusters to use is often not obvious, and choosing k automatically is a hard algorithmic prob- lem. In this paper we present an improved algorithm for learning k while clustering. The G-means algorithm is based on a statistical test for the hypothesis that a subset of data follows a Gaussian distribution. G-means runs k-means with increasing k in a hierarchical fashion until the test ac- cepts the hypothesis that the data assigned to each k-means center are Gaussian. Two key advantages are that the hypothesis test does not limit the covariance of the data and does not compute a full covariance matrix. Additionally, G-means only requires one intuitive parameter, the stand- ard statistical signi\ufb01cance level \u03b1. We present results from experiments showing that the algorithm works well, and better than a recent method based on the BIC penalty for model complexity. In these experiments, we show that the BIC is ineffective as a scoring function, since it does not penalize strongly enough the model\u2019s complexity.",

For the analysis of standard PCA we study the case where the data has increased variance along a small number of symmetry-breaking directions. The spectrum depends on the strength of the symmetry-breaking signals and on a pa- rameter (cid:11) which is the ratio of sample size to data dimension. Results are derived in the limit of large data dimension while keeping (cid:11) \ufb01xed. As (cid:11) increases there are transitions in which delta functions emerge from the upper end of the bulk spectrum, corresponding to the symmetry-breaking directions in the data, and we calculate the bias in the corresponding eigenvalues. For kernel PCA the covariance matrix in feature space may contain symmetry-breaking structure even when the data components are independently distributed with equal variance. We show examples of phase-transition behaviour analogous to the PCA results in this case.",

In this work we show that ALP solutions are not limited only to MDPs with (cid:2)nite state spaces, but that they can also be applied successfully to factored continuous-state MDPs (CMDPs). We show how one can build an ALP-based approximation for such a model and contrast it to existing solution methods. We argue that this approach offers a robust alternative for solving high dimensional continuous-state space problems. The point is supported by experiments on three CMDP problems with 24-25 continuous state factors.",

This paper focuses on predicting the existence and the type of links between entities in such domains. We apply the relational Markov network framework of Taskar et al. to de\ufb01ne a joint probabilis- tic model over the entire link graph \u2014 entity attributes and links. The application of the RMN algorithm to this task requires the de\ufb01nition of probabilistic patterns over subgraph structures. We apply this method to two new relational datasets, one involving university webpages, and the other a social network. We show that the collective classi\ufb01cation approach of RMNs, and the introduction of subgraph patterns over link labels, provide signi\ufb01cant improvements in accuracy over \ufb02at classi\ufb01cation, which attempts to predict each link in isolation.",

        "abstract": "Many problems in information processing involve some form of dimen- sionality reduction. In this paper, we introduce Locality Preserving Pro- jections (LPP). These are linear projective maps that arise by solving a variational problem that optimally preserves the neighborhood structure of the data set. LPP should be seen as an alternative to Principal Com- ponent Analysis (PCA) \u2013 a classical linear technique that projects the data along the directions of maximal variance. When the high dimen- sional data lies on a low dimensional manifold embedded in the ambient space, the Locality Preserving Projections are obtained by \ufb01nding the optimal linear approximations to the eigenfunctions of the Laplace Bel- trami operator on the manifold. As a result, LPP shares many of the data representation properties of nonlinear techniques such as Laplacian Eigenmaps or Locally Linear Embedding. Yet LPP is linear and more crucially is de\ufb01ned everywhere in ambient space rather than just on the training data points. This is borne out by illustrative examples on some high dimensional data sets.",

We present a general framework for batch learning of label ranking functions from supervised data. We assume that each instance in the training data is associated with a list of preferences over the label-set, however we do not assume that this list is either com- plete or consistent. This enables us to accommodate a variety of ranking problems. In contrast to the general form of the supervision, our goal is to learn a ranking function that induces a total order over the entire set of labels. Special cases of our setting are multilabel categorization and hierarchical classi\ufb01cation. We present a general boosting-based learning algorithm for the label ranking problem and prove a lower bound on the progress of each boosting iteration. The applicability of our approach is demonstrated with a set of experiments on a large-scale text corpus.",

We formulate and prove a suf\u00a3cient condition for the solutions of regularized loss functions to converge to margin maximizing separa- tors, as the regularization vanishes. This condition covers the hinge loss of SVM, the exponential loss of AdaBoost and logistic regression loss. We also generalize it to multi-class classi\u00a3cation problems, and present margin maximizing multi- class versions of logistic regression and support vector machines.",

        "abstract": "In typical classi\ufb01cation tasks, we seek a function which assigns a label to a sin- gle object. Kernel-based approaches, such as support vector machines (SVMs), which maximize the margin of con\ufb01dence of the classi\ufb01er, are the method of choice for many such tasks. Their popularity stems both from the ability to use high-dimensional feature spaces, and from their strong theoretical guaran- tees. However, many real-world tasks involve sequential, spatial, or structured data, where multiple labels must be assigned. Existing kernel-based methods ig- nore structure in the problem, assigning labels independently to each object, los- ing much useful information. Conversely, probabilistic graphical models, such as Markov networks, can represent correlations between labels, by exploiting problem structure, but cannot handle high-dimensional feature spaces, and lack strong theoretical generalization guarantees. In this paper, we present a new framework that combines the advantages of both approaches: Maximum mar- gin Markov (M3) networks incorporate both kernels, which ef\ufb01ciently deal with high-dimensional features, and the ability to capture correlations in structured data. We present an ef\ufb01cient algorithm for learning M3 networks based on a compact quadratic program formulation. We provide a new theoretical bound for generalization in structured domains. Experiments on the task of handwrit- ten character recognition and collective hypertext classi\ufb01cation demonstrate very signi\ufb01cant gains over previous approaches.",

We analyze the estimation of one such model for which this nonlinear step is implemented by a noisy, leaky, integrate-and-\ufb01re mechanism with a spike-dependent after- current. This model is a biophysically plausible alternative to models with Poisson (memory-less) spiking, and has been shown to effectively reproduce various spiking statistics of neurons in vivo. However, the problem of estimating the model from extracellular spike train data has not been examined in depth. We formulate the problem in terms of max- imum likelihood estimation, and show that the computational problem of maximizing the likelihood is tractable. Our main contribution is an algorithm and a proof that this algorithm is guaranteed to \ufb01nd the global optimum with reasonable speed. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our estimator with numerical simulations.",

We introduce a more general and more robust formulation of NLDR based on the singular value de- composition (SVD). In this framework, most spectral NLDR principles can be recovered by taking a subset of the constraints in a quadratic form built from local nullspaces on the manifold. The minimax formulation also opens up an interesting class of methods in which the graph is \u201cdec- orated\u201d with information at the vertices, offering discrete or continuous maps, reduced computational complexity, and immunity to some solu- tion instabilities of eigenfunction approaches. Apropos, we show almost all NLDR methods based on eigenvalue decompositions (EVD) have a so- lution instability that increases faster than problem size. This pathology can be observed (and corrected via the minimax formulation) in problems as small as N < 100 points.",

        "abstract": "In this paper we present a generative latent variable model for rating-based collaborative (cid:12)ltering called the User Rating Pro(cid:12)le model (URP). The generative process which underlies URP is de- signed to produce complete user rating pro(cid:12)les, an assignment of one rating to each item for each user. Our model represents each user as a mixture of user attitudes, and the mixing proportions are distributed according to a Dirichlet random variable. The rating for each item is generated by selecting a user attitude for the item, and then selecting a rating according to the preference pattern associ- ated with that attitude. URP is related to several models including a multinomial mixture model, the aspect model [7], and LDA [1], but has clear advantages over each.",

        "abstract": "This paper reports on a family of computationally practical classi\ufb01ers that converge to the Bayes error at near-minimax optimal rates for a va- riety of distributions. The classi\ufb01ers are based on dyadic classi\ufb01cation trees (DCTs), which involve adaptively pruned partitions of the feature space. A key aspect of DCTs is their spatial adaptivity, which enables lo- cal (rather than global) \ufb01tting of the decision boundary. Our risk analysis involves a spatial decomposition of the usual concentration inequalities, leading to a spatially adaptive, data-dependent pruning criterion. For any distribution on (X, Y ) whose Bayes decision boundary behaves locally like a Lipschitz smooth function, we show that the DCT error converges to the Bayes error at a rate within a logarithmic factor of the minimax optimal rate. We also study DCTs equipped with polynomial classi\ufb01ca- tion rules at each leaf, and show that as the smoothness of the boundary increases their errors converge to the Bayes error at a rate approaching n\u22121/2, the parametric rate. We are not aware of any other practical classi- \ufb01ers that provide similar rate of convergence guarantees. Fast algorithms for tree pruning are discussed.",

Using likelihood-ratio based classi\ufb01cation, it is possible to correct for this discrepancy by \ufb01nding class-pair speci\ufb01c terms to adjust the likelihood ratio directly, and that can make class-pair preference relationships in- transitive. In this work, we introduce new methodology that makes nec- essary corrections to the likelihood ratio, speci\ufb01cally those that are nec- essary to achieve perfect classi\ufb01cation (but not perfect likelihood-ratio correction which can be overkill). The new corrections, while weaker than previously reported such adjustments, are analytically challenging since they involve discontinuous functions, therefore requiring several approximations. We test a number of these new schemes on an isolated- word speech recognition task as well as on the UCI machine learning data sets. Results show that by using the bias terms calculated in this new way, classi\ufb01cation accuracy can substantially improve over both the baseline and over our previous results.",

        "abstract": "We propose a non-linear Canonical Correlation Analysis (CCA) method which works by coordinating or aligning mixtures of linear models. In the same way that CCA extends the idea of PCA, our work extends re- cent methods for non-linear dimensionality reduction to the case where multiple embeddings of the same underlying low dimensional coordi- nates are observed, each lying on a different high dimensional manifold. We also show that a special case of our method, when applied to only a single manifold, reduces to the Laplacian Eigenmaps algorithm. As with previous alignment schemes, once the mixture models have been estimated, all of the parameters of our model can be estimated in closed form without local optima in the learning. Experimental results illustrate the viability of the approach as a non-linear extension of CCA.",

Here we show that for (cid:12)lters that are constructed as a RBF network with Gaussian basis functions, a decomposition into linear (cid:12)lters exists, which can be computed e(cid:14)ciently in the frequency domain, yielding dramatic improvement in speed. We present an application of this idea to image processing. In electron micrograph images of photoreceptor terminals of the fruit (cid:13)y, Drosophila, synaptic vesicles containing neurotransmitter should be detected and labeled automatically. We use hand labels, provided by human experts, to learn a RBF (cid:12)lter using Support Vector Regression with Gaussian kernels. We will show that the resulting nonlinear (cid:12)lter solves the task to a degree of accuracy, which is close to what can be achieved by human experts.

To  account  for  nonlinearities  we  propose  a  model  that  synthesizes  more  than  30  years  of  research  in  the  field.  Model  neurons  have  a  linear  receptive  field,  and  a  nonlinear,  divisive  suppressive field. The suppressive field computes local root-mean- square  contrast.  To  test  this  model  we  recorded  responses  from  LGN of anesthetized paralyzed cats. We estimate model parameters  from  a  basic  set  of  measurements  and  show  that  the  model  can  accurately  predict  responses  to  novel  stimuli.  The  model  might  serve  as  the  new  standard  model  of  LGN  responses.  It  specifies  how  visual  processing  in  LGN  involves  both  linear  filtering  and  divisive gain control.",

Nonstationary covariance functions allow the model to adapt to functions whose smoothness varies with the inputs. The class includes a nonstationary version of the Mat\u00e9rn stationary co- variance, in which the differentiability of the regression function is con- trolled by a parameter, freeing one from \ufb01xing the differentiability in advance. In experiments, the nonstationary GP regression model per- forms well when the input space is two or three dimensions, outperform- ing a neural network model and Bayesian free-knot spline models, and competitive with a Bayesian neural network, but is outperformed in one dimension by a state-of-the-art Bayesian free-knot spline model. The model readily generalizes to non-Gaussian data. Use of computational methods for speeding GP \ufb01tting may allow for implementation of the method on larger datasets.",

In this paper we describe and analyze a simple approach for an on-the-\ufb02y reduction of the number of past examples used for prediction. Experiments performed with real datasets show that using the proposed algorithmic approach with a single epoch is competitive with the sup- port vector machine (SVM) although the latter, being a batch algorithm, accesses each training example multiple times.",

The recognition strategy applies learning in two layers: a \ufb01ltering layer, which reduces the search space by identi- fying plausible phrase candidates, and a ranking layer, which recursively builds the optimal phrase structure. We provide a recognition-based feed- back rule which re\ufb02ects to each local function its committed errors from a global point of view, and allows to train them together online as percep- trons. Experimentation on a syntactic parsing problem, the recognition of clause hierarchies, improves state-of-the-art results and evinces the advantages of our global training method over optimizing each function locally and independently.",

        "abstract": "There exist many different generalization error bounds for classi\ufb01cation. Each of these bounds contains an improvement over the others for cer- tain situations. Our goal is to combine these different improvements into a single bound. In particular we combine the PAC-Bayes approach intro- duced by McAllester [1], which is interesting for averaging classi\ufb01ers, with the optimal union bound provided by the generic chaining technique developed by Fernique and Talagrand [2]. This combination is quite nat- ural since the generic chaining is based on the notion of majorizing mea- sures, which can be considered as priors on the set of classi\ufb01ers, and such priors also arise in the PAC-bayesian setting.",

In particular, spectral clustering methods have the advantage of being able to divide arbitrarily shaped clusters and are based on ef(cid:2)cient eigenvector calcu- lations. However, spectral methods lack a straightforward probabilistic interpretation which makes it dif(cid:2)cult to automatically set parameters us- ing training data. In this paper we use the previously proposed typical cut framework for pairwise clustering. We show an equivalence between calculating the typical cut and inference in an undirected graphical model. We show that for clustering problems with hundreds of datapoints exact inference may still be possible. For more complicated datasets, we show that loopy be- lief propagation (BP) and generalized belief propagation (GBP) can give excellent results on challenging clustering problems. We also use graph- ical models to derive a learning algorithm for af(cid:2)nity matrices based on labeled data.",

Of these, salinity sensors are particularly susceptible to bio- fouling, which gradually degrades sensor response and corrupts crit- ical data. Automatic fault detectors have the capability to identify bio-fouling early and minimize data loss. Complicating the devel- opment of discriminatory classi(cid:12)ers is the scarcity of bio-fouling onset examples and the variability of the bio-fouling signature. To solve these problems, we take a novelty detection approach that incorporates a parameterized bio-fouling model. These detectors identify the occurrence of bio-fouling, and its onset time as reliably as human experts. Real-time detectors installed during the sum- mer of 2001 produced no false alarms, yet detected all episodes of sensor degradation before the (cid:12)eld sta(cid:11) scheduled these sensors for cleaning. From this initial deployment through February 2003, our bio-fouling detectors have essentially doubled the amount of useful data coming from the CORIE sensors.",

Taking the case of space for example, is there a way for this algorithm to realize that its body is in a three dimensional world? Is it possible for this algorithm to discover how to move in a straight line? And more basically: do these questions make any sense at all given that the algorithm only has access to the very high-dimensional data consisting of its sensory inputs and motor outputs? We demonstrate in this article how these questions can be given a positive answer. We show that it is possible to make an algorithm that, by ana- lyzing the law that links its motor outputs to its sensory inputs, discovers information about the structure of the world regardless of the devices constituting the body it is linked to. We present results from simulations demonstrating a way to issue motor orders resulting in \u201cfundamental\u201d movements of the body as regards the structure of the physical world.",

        "abstract": "Recently, relevance vector machines (RVM) have been fashioned from a sparse Bayesian learning (SBL) framework to perform supervised learn- ing using a weight prior that encourages sparsity of representation. The methodology incorporates an additional set of hyperparameters govern- ing the prior, one for each weight, and then adopts a speci\ufb01c approxi- mation to the full marginalization over all weights and hyperparameters. Despite its empirical success however, no rigorous motivation for this particular approximation is currently available. To address this issue, we demonstrate that SBL can be recast as the application of a rigorous vari- ational approximation to the full model by expressing the prior in a dual form. This formulation obviates the necessity of assuming any hyperpri- ors and leads to natural, intuitive explanations of why sparsity is achieved in practice.",

Large corpora of speech data available in recent years allow experimentation with long term statistics of phone patterns, word patterns, etc. of an individual. We propose the use of support vector machines and term frequency analysis of phone se- quences to model a given speaker. To this end, we explore techniques for text categorization applied to the problem. We derive a new kernel based upon a linearization of likelihood ratio scoring.

We also demonstrate this algorithm on several grid-world POMDPs, a planar biped walking robot, and a double-pole balancing problem.",

The sensory uncertainty can be reduced by using information about the distribution of previously ex- perienced tasks. Here we impose a distribution on a novel sensorimotor task and manipulate the variability of the sensory feedback. We show that subjects internally represent both the distribution of the task as well as their sensory uncertainty. Moreover, they combine these two sources of information in a way that is qualitatively predicted by optimal Bayesian processing. We further analyze if the subjects can represent multimodal distributions such as mixtures of Gaussians. The results show that the CNS employs probabilistic models during sensorimotor learning even when the priors are multimodal.",

However, a signi\ufb01cant problem with algorithms that manipu- late spectrograms is that the output spectrogram does not include a phase component, which is needed to create a time-domain signal that has good perceptual quality. Here we describe a generative model of time-domain speech signals and their spectrograms, and show how an ef\ufb01cient opti- mizer can be used to \ufb01nd the maximum a posteriori speech signal, given the spectrogram. In contrast to techniques that alternate between esti- mating the phase and a spectrally-consistent signal, our technique di- rectly infers the speech signal, thus jointly optimizing the phase and a spectrally-consistent signal. We compare our technique with a standard method using signal-to-noise ratios, but we also provide audio \ufb01les on the web for the purpose of demonstrating the improvement in perceptual quality that our technique offers.",

However, electrophysiological recordings of local \ufb01eld poten- tials show strong correlations in aggregate activity over signi\ufb01cant dis- tances. Indeed, it seems very likely that stimulus-evoked activity would follow strongly correlated time-courses in different brain areas.

In many practi- cal problems, the estimation of those probabilities is far from accurate. Hence, estimation errors are limiting factors in applying MDPs to real- world problems. We propose an algorithm for solving \ufb01nite-state and \ufb01nite-action MDPs, where the solution is guaranteed to be robust with respect to estimation errors on the state transition probabilities. Our al- gorithm involves a statistically accurate yet numerically ef\ufb01cient repre- sentation of uncertainty, via Kullback-Leibler divergence bounds. The worst-case complexity of the robust algorithm is the same as the origi- nal Bellman recursion. Hence, robustness can be added at practically no extra computing cost.",

The boundary saliency is de\ufb01ned using the Gestalt laws of closure, proximity, and continuity. This pa- per \ufb01rst constructs an undirected graph with two different sets of edges: solid edges and dashed edges. The weights of solid and dashed edges measure the local saliency in and between boundary fragments, respec- tively. Then the most salient boundary is detected by searching for an optimal cycle in this graph with minimum average weight. The proposed approach guarantees the global optimality without introducing any biases related to region area or boundary length. We collect a variety of images for testing the proposed approach with encouraging results.",

This paper presents Sample Propagation, an ef\ufb01cient implementation of Rao\u2013Blackwellized approximate inference for a large class of models. Sample Propagation tightly integrates sampling with message passing in a junction tree, and is named for its simple, appealing structure: it walks the clusters of a junction tree, sampling some of the current cluster\u2019s variables and then passing a message to one of its neighbors. We discuss the application of Sample Propagation to conditional Gaussian inference problems such as switching linear dynamical systems.",

An on-line algorithm for probability forecasting is said to be well-calibrated if the probabilities it outputs agree with the observed frequencies. We give a natural non- asymptotic formalization of the notion of well-calibratedness, which we then study under the assumption of randomness (the object/label pairs are independent and identically distributed). It turns out that, although no probability forecasting algorithm is automatically well-calibrated in our sense, there exists a wide class of algorithms for \u201cmultiprobability forecasting\u201d (such algorithms are allowed to output a set, ideally very narrow, of probability measures) which satisfy this property; we call the algorithms in this class \u201cVenn probability machines\u201d. Our experimental results demonstrate that a 1-Nearest Neighbor Venn probability machine performs reasonably well on a standard benchmark data set, and one of our theoretical results asserts that a simple Venn probability machine asymptotically approaches the true conditional probabilities regardless, and without knowledge, of the true probability measure generating the examples.",

Combining the PLA with a probabilistic rescaling algorithm (which, on average, increases the size of the feasable region) results in a prob- abilistic algorithm for solving SDPs that runs in polynomial time.

In this work, we de- velop simple and scalable cluster kernel techniques for incorporating un- labeled data into the representation of protein sequences. We show that our methods greatly improve the classi\ufb01cation performance of string ker- nels and outperform standard approaches for using unlabeled data, such as adding close homologs of the positive examples to the training data.

This combination leads to a log-determinant max- imization problem that can be solved by ef\ufb01cient interior point meth- ods [8]. As with the Bethe approximation and its generalizations [12], the optimizing arguments of this problem can be taken as approximations to the exact marginals. In contrast to Bethe/Kikuchi approaches, our vari- ational problem is strictly convex and so has a unique global optimum. An additional desirable feature is that the value of the optimal solution is guaranteed to provide an upper bound on the log partition function. In experimental trials, the performance of the log-determinant relaxation is comparable to or better than the sum-product algorithm, and by a sub- stantial margin for certain problem classes. Finally, the zero-temperature limit of our log-determinant relaxation recovers a class of well-known semide\ufb01nite relaxations for integer programming [e.g., 3].",

As is the case for the popular Relevance Vector Machine (RVM) [10, 11], the method automatically identi\ufb01es the number and locations of the kernels. Our algorithm overcomes some of the computational dif\ufb01culties related to batch methods for kernel regression. It is non-iterative, and requires only a single pass over the data. It is thus applicable to truly sequen- tial data sets and batch data sets alike. The algorithm is based on a generalisation of Importance Sampling, which allows the design of in- tuitively simple and ef\ufb01cient proposal distributions for the model param- eters. Comparative results on two standard data sets show our algorithm to compare favourably with existing batch estimation strategies.",

        "abstract": "The Minimax Probability Machine Classi\ufb01cation (MPMC) framework [Lanckriet et al., 2002] builds classi\ufb01ers by minimizing the maximum probability of misclassi\ufb01cation, and gives direct estimates of the proba- bilistic accuracy bound \u2126. The only assumptions that MPMC makes is that good estimates of means and covariance matrices of the classes exist. However, as with Support Vector Machines, MPMC is computationally expensive and requires extensive cross validation experiments to choose kernels and kernel parameters that give good performance. In this paper we address the computational cost of MPMC by proposing an algorithm that constructs nonlinear sparse MPMC (SMPMC) models by incremen- tally adding basis functions (i.e. kernels) one at a time \u2013 greedily select- ing the next one that maximizes the accuracy bound \u2126. SMPMC auto- matically chooses both kernel parameters and feature weights without us- ing computationally expensive cross validation. Therefore the SMPMC algorithm simultaneously addresses the problem of kernel selection and feature selection (i.e. feature weighting), based solely on maximizing the accuracy bound \u2126. Experimental results indicate that we can obtain reli- able bounds \u2126, as well as test set accuracies that are comparable to state of the art classi\ufb01cation algorithms.",

        "abstract": "In this paper, sparse representation (factorization) of a data matrix is \ufb01rst discussed. An overcomplete basis matrix is estimated by using the K(cid:0)means method. We have proved that for the estimated overcom- plete basis matrix, the sparse solution (coef\ufb01cient matrix) with minimum l1(cid:0)norm is unique with probability of one, which can be obtained using a linear programming algorithm. The comparisons of the l1(cid:0)norm so- lution and the l0(cid:0)norm solution are also presented, which can be used in recoverability analysis of blind source separation (BSS). Next, we ap- ply the sparse matrix factorization approach to BSS in the overcomplete case. Generally, if the sources are not suf\ufb01ciently sparse, we perform blind separation in the time-frequency domain after preprocessing the observed data using the wavelet packets transformation. Third, an EEG experimental data analysis example is presented to illustrate the useful- ness of the proposed approach and demonstrate its performance. Two almost independent components obtained by the sparse representation method are selected for phase synchronization analysis, and their peri- ods of signi\ufb01cant phase synchronization are found which are related to tasks. Finally, concluding remarks review the approach and state areas that require further study.",

At its core is a multilayer perceptron (MLP) trained to map sen- sor signals and head position to dipole location. Including head position overcomes the previous need to retrain the MLP for each subject and ses- sion. The training dataset was generated by mapping randomly chosen dipoles and head positions through an analytic model and adding noise from real MEG recordings. After training, a localization took 0.7 ms with an average error of 0.90 cm. A few iterations of a Levenberg-Marquardt routine using the MLP\u2019s output as its initial guess took 15 ms and im- proved the accuracy to 0.53 cm, only slightly above the statistical limits on accuracy imposed by the noise. We applied these methods to localize single dipole sources from MEG components isolated by blind source separation and compared the estimated locations to those generated by standard manually-assisted commercial software.",

        "abstract": "A balanced network leads to contradictory constraints on memory  models, as exemplified in previous work on accommodation of  synfire chains. Here we show that these constraints can be  overcome by introducing a 'shadow' inhibitory pattern for each  excitatory pattern of the model. This is interpreted as a double- balance principle, whereby there exists both global balance  between average excitatory and inhibitory currents and local  balance between the currents carrying coherent activity at any  given time frame. This principle can be applied to networks with  Hebbian cell assemblies, leading to a high capacity of the  associative memory. The number of possible patterns is limited by  a combinatorial constraint that turns out to be P=0.06N within the  specific model that we employ. This limit is reached by the  Hebbian cell assembly network. To the best of our knowledge this  is the first time that such high memory capacities are demonstrated  in the asynchronous state of models of spiking neurons.",

Face to face communication is a real-time process operating at a time scale of less than a second. In this paper we present progress on a perceptual primitive to automatically detect frontal faces in the video stream and code them with respect to 7 dimensions in real time: neutral, anger, disgust, fear, joy, sadness, sur- prise. The face \ufb01nder employs a cascade of feature detectors trained with boosting techniques [13, 2]. The expression recognizer employs a novel combination of Adaboost and SVM\u2019s. The generalization performance to new subjects for a 7-way forced choice was 93.3% and 97% correct on two publicly available datasets. The outputs of the classi\ufb01er change smoothly as a function of time, providing a potentially valuable repre- sentation to code facial expression dynamics in a fully automatic and unobtrusive manner. The system was deployed and evaluated for mea- suring spontaneous facial expressions in the \ufb01eld in an application for automatic assessment of human-robot interaction.",

This problem is important because such classi\ufb01ers con- stitute \u201cvirtual sensors\u201d of hidden cognitive states, which may be useful in cognitive science research and clinical applications. In recent work, Mitchell, et al. [6,7,9] have demonstrated the feasibility of training such classi\ufb01ers for individual human subjects (e.g., to distinguish whether the subject is reading an ambiguous or unambiguous sentence, or whether they are reading a noun or a verb). Here we extend that line of research, exploring how to train classi\ufb01ers that can be applied across multiple hu- man subjects, including subjects who were not involved in training the classi\ufb01er. We describe the design of several machine learning approaches to training multiple-subject classi\ufb01ers, and report experimental results demonstrating the success of these methods in learning cross-subject classi\ufb01ers for two different fMRI data sets.",

As a tractable structure, tree approximations have been utilized in the variational method of Ghahramani & Jordan (1997) and the se- quential projection method of Frey et al. (2000). However, belief propa- gation represents each factor of the graph with a product of single-node messages. In this paper, belief propagation is extended to represent fac- tors with tree approximations, by way of the expectation propagation framework. That is, each factor sends a \u201cmessage\u201d to all pairs of nodes in a tree structure. The result is more accurate inferences and more fre- quent convergence than ordinary belief propagation, at a lower cost than variational trees or double-loop algorithms.",

This paper addresses the issues of learn- ing structured knowledge from a large-scale natural language data set, and of generalization to unseen text. The implemented algorithm repre- sents sentences as paths on a graph whose vertices are words (or parts of words). Signi\ufb01cant patterns, determined by recursive context-sensitive statistical inference, form new vertices. Linguistic constructions are rep- resented by trees composed of signi\ufb01cant patterns and their associated equivalence classes. An input module allows the algorithm to be sub- jected to a standard test of English as a Second Language (ESL) pro\ufb01- ciency. The results are encouraging: the model attains a level of per- formance considered to be \u201cintermediate\u201d for 9th-grade students, de- spite having been trained on a corpus (CHILDES) containing transcribed speech of parents directed to small children.",

This allows for non-Gaussian processes and non-Gaussian noise. The learning algo- rithm chooses a nonlinear transformation such that transformed data is well-modelled by a GP. This can be seen as including a preprocessing transformation as an integral part of the probabilistic modelling problem, rather than as an ad-hoc step. We demonstrate on several real regression problems that learning the transformation can lead to signi\ufb01cantly better performance than using a regular GP, or a GP with a \ufb01xed transformation.",

We give examples of synthetic image articulation databases which obey these conditions; these require separated support and facto- rial sampling. For such databases there is a generative model in terms of \u2018parts\u2019 and NMF correctly identi\ufb01es the \u2018parts\u2019.

If the Markov chain is started at the data distribution, learning often works well even if the chain is only run for a few time steps [3]. But if the data distribution contains modes separated by regions of very low density, brief MCMC will not ensure that different modes have the correct relative energies because it cannot move particles from one mode to another. We show how to improve brief MCMC by allowing long-range moves that are suggested by the data distribution.
