Its  hardware  is  based  on  our  previously  proposed  forward-inverse-relaxation  neural  network  (Wada  & Kawato,  1993).  Computationally,  its  optimization  principle  is  the  minimum  torque(cid:173) change criterion.  Regarding  the  representation level, hard constraints  satisfied by a trajectory are represented as a set of via-points extracted  from  a  handwritten  character.  Accordingly,  we  propose a  via-point  estimation  algorithm  that  estimates  via-points  by  repeating  the  trajectory formation of a character and the via-point extraction from  the  character.  In  experiments,  good  quantitative  agreement  is  found  between  human  handwriting data and the trajectories generated by  the  theory.  Finally,  we  propose  a  recognition  schema  based  on  the  movement  generation.  We  show  a  result  in  which  the  recognition  schema is applied to the handwritten character recognition and can be  extended to the phoneme timing estimation of natural speech.",

The model accounts for a  number of psychophysical observations including experiments based on  novel random textures.

We  describe  an  architecture,  called  DOLCE, that allows discrete  states to evolve in a net as learn(cid:173) ing  progresses.  DOLCE  consists  of a  standard  recurrent  neural  net  trained  by  gradient  descent  and  an  adaptive  clustering  technique  that quantizes  the state space.  DOLCE  is  based  on the assumption  that a  finite  set  of discrete  internal states  is  required  for  the  task,  and that the actual network state belongs  to this  set  but has been  corrupted by noise  due  to inaccuracy in the weights.  DOLCE  learns  to  recover  the discrete  state with  maximum a  posteriori  probabil(cid:173) ity  from  the  noisy  state.  Simulations  show  that  DOLCE  leads  to  a  significant  improvement in  generalization  performance  over  earlier  neural  net  approaches  to FSM  induction.",

Previously we have shown how the discrete time \"Elman\" network  algorithm can be implemented in a network completely described  by continuous ordinary differential equations. The time steps (ma(cid:173) chine cycles) of the system are implemented by rhythmic variation  (clocking) of a bifurcation parameter. In this architecture, oscilla(cid:173) tion amplitude codes the information content or activity of a mod(cid:173) ule (unit), whereas phase and frequency are used to \"softwire\" the  network. Only synchronized modules communicate by exchang(cid:173) ing amplitude information; the activity of non-resonating modules  contributes incoherent crosstalk noise.  Attentional control is modeled as a special subset of the hidden  modules with ouputs which affect the resonant frequencies of other  hidden modules. They control synchrony among the other mod(cid:173) ules and direct the flow of computation (attention) to effect transi(cid:173) tions between two subgraphs of a thirteen state automaton which  the system emulates to generate a Reber grammar. The internal  crosstalk noise is used to drive the required random transitions of  the automaton.",

In  this paper  we  argue  that such  dendritic events are just an exu(cid:173) berant expression of a more important mechanism - a proportional  current amplifier whose primary task is to offset electrotonic losses.  Using the example of functionally important synaptic inputs to the  superficial  layers of an  anatomically and  electrophysiologically re(cid:173) constructed  layer  5 pyramidal neuron,  we  derive  and  simulate the  properties of conductances  that linearize and amplify distal synap(cid:173) tic  input  current  in  a  graded  manner.  The  amplification  depends  on a potassium conductance in the apical tuft and calcium conduc(cid:173) tances  in  the  apical trunk.",

        "abstract": "I  detail  the  design  and construction  of an  analog  VLSI  model  of the  neural system responsible for swimming behaviors of the leech.  Why  the  leech?  The  biological  network  is  small  and  relatively  well  understood,  and  the  silicon  model  can  therefore  span  three  levels  of  organization in  the leech nervous system (neuron, ganglion, system); it  represents  one of the first comprehensive models of leech  swimming  operating in  real-time.  The circuit employs  biophysically  motivated  analog neurons networked to form  multiple biologically inspired silicon  ganglia.  These  ganglia  are  coupled  using  known  interganglionic  connections.  Thus  the  model  retains  the  flavor  of  its  biological  counterpart, and  though  simplified,  the output of the  silicon circuit is  similar to  the output of the leech swim central pattern generator.  The  model operates on the same time- and spatial-scale as the leech nervous  system  and  will  provide an  excellent platform  with  which  to  explore  real-time  adaptive  locomotion  in  the  leech  and  other  \"simple\"  invertebrate nervous systems.",

A  local  modeling algorithm, locally weighted regression, is used to represent the learned  function.  Architectural parameters of the approach, such as distance metrics, are  also localized and become a function of the query point instead of being global.  Statistical tests are given for  when a local model is good enough and sampling  should be moved to a new area. Our methods explicitly deal with the case where  prediction accuracy requirements exist during exploration: By gradually shifting  a \"center of exploration\" and controlling the speed of the  shift with local pre(cid:173) diction accuracy, a goal-directed exploration of state space takes place along the  fringes  of the current data support until  the task goal is achieved. We illustrate  this  approach  with  simulation results  and results  from  a real  robot learning  a  complex juggling task.",

It then uses a set of generative weights to  convert the code vector into an approximate reconstruction of the input  vector.  We derive an objective function for training autoencoders based  on the  Minimum  Description Length  (MDL)  principle.  The aim  is  to  minimize the information required to describe both the code vector and  the reconstruction error.  We  show  that this information  is  minimized  by choosing code vectors stochastically according to a Boltzmann distri(cid:173) bution, where the generative weights define the energy of each possible  code vector given  the input vector.  Unfortunately,  if the code vectors  use distributed representations, it is exponentially expensive to compute  this Boltzmann distribution because it involves all possible code vectors.  We show that the recognition weights of an autoencoder can  be used to  compute an approximation to the Boltzmann distribution and that this ap(cid:173) proximation gives an upper bound on the description length.  Even when  this bound is poor,  it can  be used  as a  Lyapunov function for learning  both the generative and the recognition weights.  We  demonstrate that  this approach can be used to learn factorial codes.",

We  present  here  an  efficient,  Bayesian  algo(cid:173) rithm for modeling a signal composed of the superposition of brief,  Poisson-distributed functions.  This methodology is  applied  to  the  specific  problem  of modeling  and  classifying  extracellular  neural  waveforms which  are  composed  of a  superposition of an  unknown  number of action potentials CAPs).  Previous  approaches have had  limited success due largely to the problems of determining the spike  shapes,  deciding  how  many  are  shapes  distinct,  and  decomposing  overlapping APs.  A  Bayesian solution to each of these problems is  obtained  by inferring  a  probabilistic model of the  waveform.  This  approach quantifies the uncertainty of the form and number of the  inferred  AP  shapes  and  is  used  to  obtain  an  efficient  method  for  decomposing  complex overlaps.  This algorithm can extract  many  times  more  information than  previous methods  and facilitates  the  extracellular  investigation of neuronal  classes  and  of interactions  within neuronal  circuits.",

We use normalized correlation net(cid:173) works, with dynamic time warping in the temporal domain, as a distance  function for unsupervised clustering. Views are computed separably for  space and time dimensions; the distributed response of the combination  of these units characterizes the input data with a low dimensional repre(cid:173) sentation.

        "abstract": "Airline  companies  usually  schedule  their flights  and  crews  well  in  advance  to optimize  their  crew  pools  activities.  Many  events such  as  flight  delays or  the  absence  of a  member require  the  crew  pool  rescheduling team to change the initial schedule  (rescheduling).  In  this paper, we  show  that the neural network comparison paradigm  applied  to  the  backgammon  game  by  Tesauro  (Tesauro  and  Se(cid:173) jnowski,  1989)  can  also  be applied  to the rescheduling  problem of  an  aircrew  pool.  Indeed  both  problems  correspond  to  choosing  the best solut.ion  from a set of possible ones without ranking them  (called here best choice problem).  The paper explains from a math(cid:173) ematical point of view  the architecture and the learning strategy of  the backpropagation neural network used for  the best  choice  prob(cid:173) lem.  We  also  show  how  the learning  phase  of the  network  can  be  accelerated.  Finally  we  apply  the  neural  network  model  to some  real rescheduling  problems for  the  Belgian  Airline  (Sabena).",

Empirical results on two real-world problems sub(cid:173) stantiate  the  faster  learning  speed;  when  applied  to  the  training  of a  recurrent  network  on  a  well  researched  sequence  recognition  task (the Reber grammar), training times are significantly less than  previously  reported .",

        "abstract": "Reinforcement Learning methods based on approximating dynamic  programming  (DP)  are  receiving  increased  attention  due  to  their  utility  in  forming  reactive  control  policies  for  systems  embedded  in  dynamic  environments.  Environments  are  usually  modeled  as  controlled  Markov  processes,  but  when  the  environment  model  is  not known a priori,  adaptive methods are necessary.  Adaptive con(cid:173) trol methods are often classified  as being direct  or indirect.  Direct  methods directly adapt the control policy from experience,  whereas  indirect  methods adapt a  model of the controlled process and com(cid:173) pute  control  policies  based  on  the  latest  model.  Our  focus  is  on  indirect  adaptive  DP-based  methods  in  this  paper.  We  present  a  convergence  result  for  indirect  adaptive  asynchronous  value  itera(cid:173) tion algorithms for the case in which a look-up table is used to store  the  value  function.  Our  result  implies  convergence  of several  ex(cid:173) isting reinforcement  learning algorithms such as adaptive real-time  dynamic programming (ARTDP)  (Barto,  Bradtke, &  Singh,  1993)  and prioritized  sweeping  (Moore  &  Atkeson,  1993).  Although  the  emphasis  of researchers  studying DP-based reinforcement  learning  has been on direct  adaptive methods such as Q-Learning (Watkins,  1989)  and  methods  using  TD  algorithms  (Sutton,  1988),  it is  not  clear that these direct methods are preferable in practice to indirect  methods such as those  analyzed  in  this  paper.",

How(cid:173) ever, the statistics of the fluctuations in the local activities may  be an important testing ground for comparison between models  and observed cortical dynamics. We evaluated the neuronal cor(cid:173) relation functions in a stochastic network comprising of excitatory  and inhibitory populations. We show that when the network is in  a stationary state, the cross-correlations are relatively weak, i.e.,  their amplitude relative to that of the auto-correlations are of or(cid:173) der of 1/ N, N being the size of the interacting population. This  holds except in the neighborhoods of bifurcations to nonstationary  states. As a bifurcation point is approached the amplitude of the  cross-correlations grows and becomes of order 1 and the decay time(cid:173) constant diverges. This behavior is analogous to the phenomenon  of critical slowing down in systems at thermal equilibrium near a  critical point. Near a Hopf bifurcation the cross-correlations ex(cid:173) hibit damped oscillations.",

        "abstract": "Online cursive handwriting recognition  is  currently one of the most  intriguing challenges in  pattern recognition.  This study  presents  a  novel  approach  to this  problem which  is  composed  of two  comple(cid:173) mentary  phases.  The first  is  dynamic encoding  of the  writing  tra(cid:173) jectory into a  compact sequence  of discrete  motor control symbols.  In this compact representation we largely remove the redundancy of  the script,  while  preserving  most of its intelligible components.  In  the second  phase these  control sequences  are used  to train adaptive  probabilistic acyclic automata (PAA) for the important ingredients  of the writing  trajectories,  e.g.  letters.  We  present  a  new  and effi(cid:173) cient  learning algorithm for such stochastic automata, and demon(cid:173) strate  its  utility  for  spotting  and  segmentation of cursive  scripts.  Our  experiments  show  that  over  90%  of  the  letters  are  correctly  spotted  and  identified,  prior to  any  higher  level  language  model.  Moreover,  both  the  training  and  recognition  algorithms  are  very  efficient  compared to other  modeling methods, and the models are  'on-line' adaptable to other  writers  and  styles.",

We show how MDL can be used to  develop highly redundant population codes. Each hidden unit has  a location in a low-dimensional implicit space. If the hidden unit  activities form a bump of a standard shape in this space, they can  be cheaply encoded by the center ofthis bump. So the weights from  the input units to the hidden units in an autoencoder are trained  to make the activities form a standard bump. The coordinates of  the hidden units in the implicit space are also learned, thus allow(cid:173) ing flexibility, as the network develops a discontinuous topography  when presented with different input classes. Population-coding in  a space other than the input enables a network to extract nonlinear  higher-order properties of the inputs.",

        "abstract": "Maps of orientation preference and ocular dominance were recorded  optically from the cortices of 5 infant macaque monkeys, ranging in  age from 3.5 to 14 weeks.  In agreement with previous observations,  we  found  that basic features  of orientation and ocular  dominance  maps, as well  as correlations between them, are present  and robust  by  3.5  weeks  of age.  We  did  observe  changes  in  the  strength  of  ocular dominance signals, as  well  as  in the spacing of ocular dom(cid:173) inance bands, both of which  increased steadily between  3.5 and  14  weeks  of age.  The  latter  finding  suggests  that  the  adult  spacing  of ocular dominance bands depends on cortical growth in  neonatal  animals.  Since  we  found  no  corresponding  increase  in  the spacing  of orientation  preferences,  however,  there  is  a  possibility  that  the  orientation preferences  of some cells  change as  the cortical surface  expands.  Since  correlations  between  the  patterns  of orientation  selectivity  and ocular dominance  are  present  at  an  age,  when  the  visual system is still immature, it seems more likely that  their  de(cid:173) velopment may be an innate process and may not require extensive  visual experience.",

In this paper we optimize the search(cid:173) ing process for tangent distance (Simard, LeCun and Denker, 1993)  to improve speed performance. The closest prototypes are found  by recursively searching included subset.s of the database using dis(cid:173) tances of increasing complexit.y. This is done by using a hierarchy  of tangent distances (increasing the Humber of tangent. vectors from  o to its maximum) and multiresolution (using wavelets). At each  stage, a confidence level of the classification is computed. If the  confidence is high enough, the c.omputation of more complex dis(cid:173) tances is avoided. The resulting algorithm applied to character  recognition is close to t.hree orders of magnitude faster than com(cid:173) puting the full tangent dist.ance on every prot.ot.ypes .",

Direct  access  by  content  can  be  achieved  by  transform(cid:173) ing  the  encoder  network  of  the  LRAAM  into  an  analog  Hopfield  network  with  hidden  units.  Different  access  procedures  can  be  defined  depending  on  the  access  key.  Sufficient  conditions  on  the  asymptotical stability of the associated Hopfield network are briefly  introduced.",

In this paper we use  two radial basis function networks: one as a model of an unknown  plant and the other as the controller. The controller is trained  with a recurrent learning algorithm to minimize a novel objective  function such that the controller can locate an unstable fixed point  and drive the system into the fixed point with no a priori knowl(cid:173) edge of the system dynamics.

The performance measure of interest for  these  tasks,  called  the figure  of merit (FOM),  is  the  detection  rate  for  target  patterns  when  the  false  alarm  rate  is  in  an  acceptable  range.  A  new approach to training spotters is presented which computes the FOM  gradient  for  each  input pattern  and  then  directly  maximizes  the  FOM  using  b ackpropagati on.  This  eliminates  the  need  for  thresholds  during  training. It also  uses  network resources  to model  Bayesian a posteriori  probability  functions  accurately  only  for  patterns  which  have  a  significant effect on  the  detection accuracy over the  false  alarm rate of  interest.  FOM  training  increased  detection  accuracy  by  5  percentage  points for a hybrid radial basis function  (RBF) - hidden Markov model  (HMM) wordspotter on the credit-card speech corpus.",

Some researchers have  begun  to  extracting  finite  state  machines from the internal state trajectories of their recurrent networks.  This  paper describes  how  sensitivity  to  initial  conditions  and  discrete  measurements can trick these extraction methods to return illusory finite  state descriptions.",

Previously we have shown how the discrete time \"Elman\" network  algorithm can be implemented in a network completely described  by continuous ordinary differential equations. The time steps (ma(cid:173) chine cycles) of the system are implemented by rhythmic variation  (clocking) of a bifurcation parameter. In this architecture, oscilla(cid:173) tion amplitude codes the information content or activity of a mod(cid:173) ule (unit), whereas phase and frequency are used to \"softwire\" the  network. Only synchronized modules communicate by exchang(cid:173) ing amplitude information; the activity of non-resonating modules  contributes incoherent crosstalk noise.  Attentional control is modeled as a special subset of the hidden  modules with ouputs which affect the resonant frequencies of other  hidden modules. They control synchrony among the other mod(cid:173) ules and direct the flow of computation (attention) to effect transi(cid:173) tions between two subgraphs of a thirteen state automaton which  the system emulates to generate a Reber grammar. The internal  crosstalk noise is used to drive the required random transitions of  the automaton.",

Classify(cid:173) ing software modules, based on their static complexity measures,  into different fault-prone categories is a difficult problem in soft(cid:173) ware engineering. This research investigates the applicability of  neural network classifiers for identifying fault-prone software mod(cid:173) ules using a data set from a commercial software system. A pre(cid:173) liminary empirical comparison is performed between a minimum  distance based Gaussian classifier, a perceptron classifier and a  multilayer layer feed-forward network classifier constructed using  a modified Cascade-Correlation algorithm. The modified version  of the Cascade-Correlation algorithm constrains the growth of the  network size by incorporating a cross-validation check during the  output layer training phase. Our preliminary results suggest that  a multilayer feed-forward network can be used as a tool for iden(cid:173) tifying fault-prone software modules early during the development  cycle. Other issues such as representation of software metrics and  selection of a proper training samples are also discussed.",

We report face recognition results  under drastically changing lighting conditions for a computer vision sys(cid:173) tem which concurrently uses a contrast sensitive silicon retina and a con(cid:173) ventional, gain controlled CCO camera. For both input devices the face  recognition system employs an elastic matching algorithm with wavelet  based features to classify unknown faces. To assess the effect of analog  on -chip preprocessing by the silicon retina the CCO images have been  \"digitally preprocessed\" with a bandpass filter to adjust the power spec(cid:173) trum. The silicon retina with its ability to adjust sensitivity increases  the recognition rate up to 50 percent. These comparative experiments  demonstrate that preprocessing with an analog VLSI silicon retina gen(cid:173) erates image data enriched with object-constant features.",

Indeed, networks where each  node implements a simple Boolean function (Boolean networks) can  be designed in such a way as to exhibit similar properties. Two  algorithms that generate Boolean networks from examples are pre(cid:173) sented. The results show that these algorithms generalize very  well in a class of problems that accept compact Boolean network  descriptions.

        "abstract": "Hybrid connectionistfHMM systems model time both using a Markov  chain and through properties of a connectionist network. In this paper,  we discuss the nature of the time dependence currently employed in our  systems using recurrent networks (RNs) and feed-forward multi-layer  perceptrons (MLPs). In particular, we introduce local recurrences into a  MLP to produce an enhanced input representation. This is in the form  of an adaptive gamma filter and incorporates an automatic approach for  learning temporal dependencies. We have experimented on a speaker(cid:173) independent phone recognition task using the TIMIT database. Results  using the gamma filtered input representation have shown improvement  over the baseline MLP system. Improvements have also been obtained  through merging the baseline and gamma filter models.",

The  focus  of this  report  is  inducing  the  structure  of  learning  hierarchical  models  from  data,  i.e.  model  prototypes from  observed exemplars of an  object.  At each  node  in the hierarchy, a probability distribution governing its parameters must  be learned.  The connections between  nodes reflects  the structure of the  object.  The  formulation of substructures  is  encouraged  such  that  their  parts  become  conditionally  independent.  The  resulting  model  can  be  interpreted  as  a  Bayesian  Belief Network  and  also  is  in  many  respects  similar to the stochastic visual grammar described by Mjolsness.",

We formed a hybrid speechreading system consisting  of two time delay neural networks (video and acoustic) and inte(cid:173) grated their responses by means of independent opinion pooling  - the Bayesian optimal method given conditional independence,  which seems to hold for our data. This hybrid system had an er(cid:173) ror rate 25% lower than that of the acoustic subsystem alone on a  five-utterance speaker-independent task, indicating that video can  be used to improve speech recognition.",

        "abstract": "We describe the relationship between certain reinforcement learn(cid:173) ing (RL) methods based on dynamic programming (DP) and a class  of unorthodox Monte Carlo methods for solving systems of linear  equations proposed in the 1950's. These methods recast the solu(cid:173) tion of the linear system as the expected value of a statistic suitably  defined over sample paths of a Markov chain. The significance of  our observations lies in arguments (Curtiss, 1954) that these Monte  Carlo methods scale better with respect to state-space size than do  standard, iterative techniques for solving systems of linear equa(cid:173) tions. This analysis also establishes convergence rate estimates.  Because methods used in RL systems for approximating the evalu(cid:173) ation function of a fixed control policy also approximate solutions  to systems of linear equations, the connection to these Monte Carlo  methods establishes that algorithms very similar to TD algorithms  (Sutton, 1988) are asymptotically more efficient in a precise sense  than other methods for evaluating policies. Further, all DP-based  RL methods have some of the properties of these Monte Carlo al(cid:173) gorithms, which suggests that although RL is often perceived to  be slow, for sufficiently large problems, it may in fact be more ef(cid:173) ficient than other known classes of methods capable of producing  the same results.",

We use  simplified  neurons,  but realistic  architecture.  As  a  first  conclusion,  we  postulate  that the feature extraction performed by the antennallobe (glomeruli and  interneurons)  necessitates  central  input from  the  mushroom bodies for  fine  tuning. The central input thus  facilitates  the evolution from fuzzy  olfactory images in the glomerular layer towards more focussed  images  upon odor presentation.",

This implies the existence of a set of orthogonal internal co(cid:173) ordinates that are related to meaningful coordinates of the external  world.  No  coherent  computational  theory  has  yet  been  proposed  to explain this finding.  I  have proposed a simple model which pro(cid:173) vides a framework for  a  theory of low-level motor learning.  I show  that  the  theory  predicts  the  observed  microstimulation results  in  the  barn  owl.  The  model  rests  on  the  concept  of  \"Optimal  U n(cid:173) supervised  Motor  Learning\",  which  provides  a  set  of criteria  that  predict  optimal internal  representations.  I  describe  two  iterative  Neural  Network  algorithms  which  find  the  optimal  solution  and  demonstrate  possible  mechanisms for  the  development  of internal  representations  in animals.",

We  used  a  convolutional locator  network  with four  outputs,  each  trained  to find  a  different  corner  of the  address  block.  A  simple  set of rules was used to generate ABL candidates from the network  output.

The problem of novelty  detection  is  particular(cid:173) ly  acute  when  prior  knowledge  and  training  data only  allow  one  to  construct  an  incomplete  classification  model.  Allowance  must  be  made  in  model  design  so  that  the  classifier  will  be  robust  to  data generated  by  classes  not  included  in  the  training  phase.  For  diagnosis  applications  one  practical approach  is  to  construct  both  an  input  density  model  and  a  discriminative  class  model.  Using  Bayes'  rule  and  prior  estimates  of the  relative  likelihood  of  data  of known and unknown origin the resulting classification equations  are  straightforward.  The  paper  describes  the  application  of this  method  in  the  context  of hidden  Markov  models  for  online  fault  monitoring of large  ground  antennas for  spacecraft  tracking,  with  particular  application  to  the  detection  of  transient  behaviour  of  unknown  origin.",

However, these measurements  are correct for just one side of the edge (the non occluded one).  Our approach is to introduce an uncertamty field with respect to  the estimates and confidence measures. We note that the confi(cid:173) dence measures are large at intensity edges and larger at the con(cid:173) vex sides of the edges, i.e. inside corners, than at the concave side.  We resolve the ambiguities through local interactions via coupled  Markov random fields (MRF) . The result is the detection of motion  for regions of images with large global convexity.",

This paper presents a method that uses  domain knowledge to reduce the number of failures during explo(cid:173) ration. This method formulates the set of actions from which the  RL agent composes a control policy to ensure that exploration is  conducted in a policy space that excludes most of the unacceptable  policies. The resulting action set has a more abstract relationship  to the task being solved than is common in many applications of  RL. Although the cost of this added safety is that learning may  result in a suboptimal solution, we argue that this is an appropri(cid:173) ate tradeoff in many problems.

This kind of neu(cid:173) ral network technology advanced the state-of-the-art of large-vocabulary CSR,  which employs Hidden Marlcov Models (HMM), for the ARPA 1oo0-word Re(cid:173) source Management corpus. More Recently, we started porting the neural net  system to a larger, more challenging corpus - the ARPA 20,Ooo-word Wall Street  Journal (WSJ) corpus. During the porting, we explored the following research  directions to refine the system: i) training context-dependent models with a reg(cid:173) ularization method; ii) training SNN with projection pursuit; and ii) combining  different models into a hybrid system. When tested on both a development set  and an independent test set, the resulting neural net system alone yielded a per(cid:173) fonnance at the level of the HMM system, and the hybrid SNN/HMM system  achieved a consistent 10-15% word error reduction over the HMM system. This  paper describes our hybrid system, with emphasis on the optimization methods  employed.",

        "abstract": "A new classifier is presented for text-independent speaker recognition. The  new classifier is called the modified neural tree network (MNTN). The  NTN is a hierarchical classifier that combines the properties of decision  trees and feed-forward neural networks. The MNTN differs from the stan(cid:173) dard NTN in that a new learning rule based on discriminant learning  is used, which minimizes the classification error as opposed to a norm  of the approximation error. The MNTN also uses leaf probability mea(cid:173) sures in addition to the class labels. The MNTN is evaluated for several  speaker identification experiments and is compared to multilayer percep(cid:173) trons (MLPs) , decision trees, and vector quantization (VQ) classifiers. The  VQ classifier and MNTN demonstrate comparable performance and per(cid:173) form significantly better than the other classifiers for this task. Addition(cid:173) ally, the MNTN provides a logarithmic saving in retrieval time over that  of the VQ classifier. The MNTN and VQ classifiers are also compared  for several speaker verification experiments where the MNTN is found to  outperform the VQ classifier.",

In contrast  to constructive and destructive algorithms, GNARL employs a popula(cid:173) tion of networks and uses a fitness  function's  unsupervised feedback to  guide  search  through  network  space.  Annealing  is  used  in  generating  both  gaussian  weight  changes  and  structural  modifications.  Applying  GNARL  to  a complex  search and collection task demonstrates  that the  system is capable of inducing networks with complex internal dynamics.",

This paper  introduces  the  more  general  task  of learning  constraint  surfaces.  It describes  a  simple  but  powerful  architecture  for  learning  and  manipulating  nonlinear  surfaces  from  data.  We  demonstrate  the  technique  on low dimensional synthetic surfaces  and compare it to  nearest  neighbor  approaches.  We  then  show  its  utility in learning  the space of lip images in a system for improving speech recognition  by lip  reading.  This learned  surface  is  used  to improve the visual  tracking  performance during recognition.",

Human  communication,  whether  given  as  text,  handwriting,  or  speech,  has  multi  characteristic  time  scales.  On  short  scales  it  is  characterized  mostly  by  the  dynamics  that  gen(cid:173) erate  the  process,  whereas  on  large  scales,  more syntactic  and  se(cid:173) mantic information is  carried.  For  that  reason  the  conventionally  used  fixed  memory  Markov  models  cannot  capture  effectively  the  complexity of such structures.  On the other hand using long mem(cid:173) ory  models uniformly is  not  practical  even  for  as  short memory as  four.  The  algorithm  we  propose  is  based  on  minimizing  the  sta(cid:173) tistical  prediction  error  by  extending  the  memory, or state length,  adaptively, until the total prediction error  is  sufficiently small.  We  demonstrate the algorithm by learning the structure of natural En(cid:173) glish  text  and applying the learned  model to the correction  of cor(cid:173) rupted  text .  Using  less  than  3000  states  the  model's  performance  is  far  superior  to  that  of fixed  memory models  with  similar num(cid:173) ber  of states.

Formulae have  M  clauses  from  N  variables,  randomly  negated,  keeping  the  ratio  a  =  M / N  fixed .  For  k  =  2,  this  model  has  been  proven  to  have  a  sharp  threshold  at  a  = 1  between  formulae which  are almost aways satisfiable and formulae  which  are  almost never  satisfiable  as  N  --jo  00 .  Computer  experi(cid:173) ments for  k  = 2,  3,  4,  5  and  6,  (carried  out  in  collaboration  with  B.  Selman  of ATT Bell  Labs). show  similar threshold  behavior for  each  value  of k.  Finite-size  scaling,  a  theory  of the  critical  point  phenomena used  in statistical physics, is shown  to characterize the  size  dependence  near  the  threshold.

Predicted and generated sequences were recorded as the representation of  a 153-note waltz melody was learnt by a predictive, recurrent network.  The network learned transitions and relations between and within pitch  and timing components: accent and duration values interacted in the  development of rhythmic and metric structures and, with training, the  network developed chordal expectancies in response to the activation of  individual tones. Analysis of the hidden unit representation revealed  that musical sequences are represented as transitions between states in  hidden unit space.",

This property is  important for  applications to  signal transmission and  control.  I propose two new  algorithms for iterative computation of the SVD  given  only  sample  inputs  and  outputs  from  a  matrix.  Although  there  currently exist  many algorithms for  Eigenvector  Decomposi(cid:173) tion  (Sanger  1989,  for  example),  these  are  the  first  true  sample(cid:173) based  SVD algorithms.",

We present a method for  calculating the \"noise sensitivity signature\" of a learning algorithm  which is based on scrambling the output classes. This signature can  be used to indicate a good match between the complexity of the  classifier and the complexity of the data. Use of noise sensitivity  signatures is distinctly different from other schemes to avoid over(cid:173) training, such as cross-validation, which uses only part of the train(cid:173) ing data, or various penalty functions, which are not data-adaptive.  Noise sensitivity signature methods use all of the training data and  are manifestly data-adaptive and non-parametric. They are well  suited for situations with limited training data.",
