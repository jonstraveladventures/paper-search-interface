The text people type  typically contains a tremendous amount of redundancy due to predictable  word  usage  patterns  and  the  text's  structure.  This  paper  describes  a  neural network system call AutoTypist that monitors a person's typing and  predicts what will be entered  next.  AutoTypist displays the most likely  subsequent word to the typist, who can accept it with a single keystroke,  instead of typing it in its entirety.  The multi-layer perceptron at the heart  of Auto'JYpist adapts its predictions of likely subsequent text to the user's  word usage pattern,  and to the characteristics of the text currently being  typed.  Increases in typing speed of 2-3% when typing English prose and  10-20% when typing C code have been demonstrated using the system,  suggesting a potential time savings of more than 20 hours per user per year.  In addition to increasing typing speed, AutoTypist reduces the number of  keystrokes a user must type by a similar amount (2-3% for English,  10- 20% for computer programs).  This keystroke savings has the potential to  significantly reduce the frequency  and severity of repeated stress injuries  caused by typing, which are the most common injury suffered in today's  office environment.",

        "abstract": "A training method based on a form of continuous spatially distributed  optical error back-propagation is presented for an all optical network  composed of nondiscrete neurons and weighted interconnections. The all  optical network is feed-forward and is composed of thin layers of a Kerr(cid:173) type self focusing/defocusing nonlinear optical material. The training  method is derived from a Lagrangian formulation of the constrained  minimization of the network error at the output. This leads to a  formulation that describes training as a calculation of the distributed error  of the optical signal at the output which is then reflected back through the  device to assign a spatially distributed error to the internal layers. This  error is then used to modify the internal weighting values. Results from  several computer simulations of the training are presented, and a simple  optical table demonstration of the network is discussed.",

The j oint probability distribution of the data can be used to  solve this problem. We model this with mixture models whose parameters  are estimated by the EM algorithm.  This gives the benefit that missing  data in the database itself can also be handled correctly.  The request for  new information to refine the diagnosis is performed using the maximum  utility  principle.  Since  the  system  is  based  on  learning  it  is  domain  independent and less labor intensive than expert systems or probabilistic  networks.

Our method has in theory the same recognition accuracy as  other recent  methods  based  on  ''tangent  distance\"  [Simard et al.,  1994],  since it uses the same categorization rule.  Nevertheless ours  is  significantly  faster  during  classification  because  far  fewer  tan(cid:173) gent  distances  need  be  computed.  Crucial  to  the success  of our  system  are  1)  a  novel  graph  architecture in  which  transformation  constraints and geometric  relationships  among  prototypes are en(cid:173) coded  during learning,  and 2)  an improved graph search criterion,  used during classification.  These architectural insights are applica(cid:173) ble to a wide range of problem domains.  Here we demonstrate that  on  a  handwriting  recognition task,  a  basic implementation of our  system  requires  less  than  half the  computation  of the  Euclidean  sorting method.",

        "abstract": "We  describe  an  analog  VLSI  implementation  of the ARTI  algorithm  (Carpenter, 1987). A prototype chip has been fabricated in a standard low  cost  1.5~m double-metal single-poly CMOS process. It has a die area of  lcm2  and  is  mounted in  a  12O-pins PGA package.  The chip realizes  a  modified version of the original ARTI  architecture.  Such modification  has been shown to preserve all computational properties of the original  algorithm  (Serrano,  1994a),  while  being  more  appropriate  for  VLSI  realizations. The chip implements an ARTI network with 100 F 1 nodes  and 18 F2 nodes. It can therefore cluster 100 binary pixels input patterns  into up to 18 different categories. Modular expansibility of the system is  possible  by  assembling  an  NxM  array  of  chips  without  any  extra  interfacing circuitry, resulting in an F 1 layer with  l00xN nodes, and an  F2  layer  with  18xM nodes.  Pattern  classification  is  performed  in  less  than  1.8~s, which  means  an  equivalent  computing  power of 2.2x109  connections and connection-updates per second. Although internally the  chip is analog in nature, it interfaces to the outside world through digital  signals, thus having a true asynchrounous digital behavior. Experimental  chip  test  results  are  available,  which  have  been  obtained  through  test  equipments for digital chips.",

The behavior of this  model is determined by the underlying nonlinear dynamics which  are parameterized by a set of parameters originating from the Heb(cid:173) bian rule and the arbor density of the synapses. These parameters  determine the presence or absence of a specific receptive field (also  referred to as a 'connection pattern') as a saturated fixed point  attractor of the model. In this paper, we perform a qualitative  analysis of the underlying nonlinear dynamics over the parameter  space, determine the effects of the system parameters on the emer(cid:173) gence of various receptive fields, and predict precisely within which  parameter regime the network will have the potential to develop  a specially designated connection pattern. In particular, this ap(cid:173) proach exposes, for the first time, the crucial role played by the  synaptic density functions, and provides a complete precise picture  of the parameter space that defines the relationships among the  different receptive fields. Our theoretical predictions are confirmed  by numerical simulations.",

        "abstract": "A  model  of short-term  memory for  serially  ordered  lists  of verbal  stimuli is proposed as an implementation of the 'articulatory loop'  thought  to  mediate  this  type  of memory  (Baddeley,  1986).  The  model predicts the presence  of a  repeatable time-varying 'context'  signal  coding  the  timing  of items'  presentation  in  addition  to  a  store  of phonological information and a  process  of serial rehearsal.  Items are associated with context nodes and phonemes by Hebbian  connections showing both short and long term plasticity.  Items are  activated  by  phonemic input  during  presentation  and reactivated  by context and phonemic feedback  during output.  Serial selection  of items  occurs  via a  winner-take-all  interaction  amongst  items,  with  the  winner  subsequently  receiving  decaying  inhibition.  An  approximate analysis  of error  probabilities due  to  Gaussian  noise  during  output  is  presented.  The  model  provides  an  explanatory  account of the  probability of error as  a  function of serial  position,  list  length,  word  length,  phonemic similarity,  temporal  grouping,  item and list familiarity,  and is proposed  as the starting point for  a  model of rehearsal and vocabulary acquisition.",

By  using an iterative method, AIFNN can determine an optimal affine  translation for an elastic input field to compensate for the original  deformations. The convergence of the AIFNN algorithm is shown.  AIFNN is applied for handwritten numerals recognition.

The reinforcement learning  system  uses  a  recently  developed  algorithm,  the residual gradient form  of advantage updating.  The  game  is a  Markov  Decision  Process  (MDP)  with continuous  time,  states, and actions, linear dynamics, and a quadratic cost function.  The  game consists of two players, a missile and a plane;  the missile pursues  the plane and  the plane evades the  missile.  The reinforcement learning  algorithm for optimal control is modified for differential games in order to  find the minimax point, rather than  the maximum.  Simulation results are  compared  to  the  optimal  solution,  demonstrating  that  the  simulated  reinforcement learning  system  converges  to  the optimal  answer.  The  performance of both the residual gradient and non-residual gradient forms  of advantage updating and Q-learning are compared.  The results show that  advantage  updating  converges faster  than  Q-learning in  all  simulations.  The results also show advantage updating converges regardless of the time  step duration; Q-learning is  unable to converge as the  time step duration  ~rows small.",

We sketch out a decompression algorithm for fractal  block  codes  and  then  show  how  to  implement  a  recurrent  neural  network  using  physically  simple  but highly-nonlinear,  analog  circuit  models of neurons and synapses. The nonlinear system has many fixed  points, but we have at our disposal a procedure to choose the parameters  in  such a way  that only one solution, the desired solution, is stable. As  a  partial  proof of the  concept,  we  present experimental  data  from  a  small system a 16-neuron analog CMOS chip fabricated in a 2m analog  p-well process. This chip operates in the subthreshold regime and,  for  each choice of parameters, converges to a unique stable state. Each state  exhibits a qualitatively fractal shape.",

Most of the recent emphasis in  the neural network control field has no error feedback as the  control  input,  which  rises  the  lack  of adaptation  problem.  The  integrated  architecture  in  this  paper  combines  feed  forward  control  and error  feedback  adaptive  control  using  neural  networks.  The  paper  reveals the  different  internal  functionality  of these  two  kinds of neural  network  controllers  for  certain  input  styles,  e.g.,  state  feedback  and error feedback.  With  error  feedback,  neural  network  controllers  learn  the  slopes  or  the  gains  with  respect  to  the  error  feedback,  producing  an  error  driven  adaptive  control  systems.  The  results  demonstrate  that  the  two  kinds  of control  scheme  can  be  combined  to  realize  their individual  advantages.  Testing  with disturbances added to  the  plant  shows  good  tracking  and adaptation with the integrated neural control architecture.",

Computing  the exact bias and  variance curves  as  a function of the sample size  we  are able to quantitatively compare the effect of the combination  on the bias and variance separately, and thus on the expected  error  which  is  the sum of the  two.  Our exact  calculations,  demonstrate  that the combination of estimators is particularly useful  in the case  where the data set is small and noisy and the function to be learned  is  unrealizable.  For  large  data sets  the  single  estimator produces  superior  results.  Finally,  we  show  that  by  splitting  the  data set  into  several  independent  parts  and  training  each  estimator  on  a  different subset,  the performance can in some cases  be significantly  improved.",

        "abstract": "Radial  Basis  Function  (RBF)  Networks,  also  known  as  networks  of locally-tuned processing units  (see  [6])  are well  known for  their  ease  of use.  Most  algorithms  used  to  train  these  types  of  net(cid:173) works,  however,  require a  fixed  architecture, in  which  the number  of units  in  the  hidden  layer  must  be  determined  before  training  starts.  The RCE training algorithm, introduced by  Reilly,  Cooper  and Elbaum  (see  [8]),  and its  probabilistic extension,  the P-RCE  algorithm,  take advantage of a  growing structure in  which  hidden  units are only introduced when  necessary.  The nature of these al(cid:173) gorithms allows training to reach stability much faster  than is  the  case  for  gradient-descent  based  methods.  Unfortunately  P-RCE  networks do not adjust the standard deviation of their prototypes  individually, using only one global value for  this parameter.  This  paper introduces the Dynamic Decay Adjustment  (DDA)  al(cid:173) gorithm  which  utilizes  the  constructive  nature  of the  P-RCE  al(cid:173) gorithm together with independent adaptation of each prototype's  decay factor.  In addition, this radial adjustment is  class dependent  and  distinguishes  between  different  neighbours.  It is  shown  that  networks  trained  with  the  presented  algorithm  perform  substan(cid:173) tially better than common RBF networks.",

Transforming the dendritic sum according to input  activity and unit usage can greatly increase the capacity of the  associative net under these conditions. For moderately sparse pat(cid:173) terns, maximum information efficiency is achieved with very low  connectivity levels (~ 10%).

        "abstract": "Biological sensorimotor systems are not static maps that transform  input  (sensory  information)  into  output  (motor  behavior).  Evi(cid:173) dence  from  many  lines  of research  suggests  that  their  representa(cid:173) tions are plastic, experience-dependent entities.  While this plastic(cid:173) ity is  essential for  flexible  behavior, it presents  the nervous system  with difficult organizational challenges.  If the sensorimotor system  adapts itself to perform well  under one set of circumstances,  will it  then perform poorly when placed  in an environment with different  demands  (negative  transfer)?  Will  a  later  experience-dependent  change  undo  the benefits  of previous  learning  (catastrophic  inter(cid:173) ference)?  We  explore  the first  question  in  a separate paper in  this  volume  (Shadmehr et  al.  1995).  Here  we  present  psychophysical  and computational results that explore the question of catastrophic  interference  in the context of a  dynamic motor learning task.  Un(cid:173) der  some conditions, subjects show  evidence  of catastrophic  inter(cid:173) ference.  Under  other  conditions,  however,  subjects  appear  to  be  immune to  its  effects.  These  results  suggest  that  motor  learning  can  undergo  a  process  of consolidation.  Modular neural  networks  are  well  suited  for  the  demands of learning multiple input/output  mappings.  By  incorporating the notion of fast- and slow-changing  connections  into  a  modular architecture,  we  were  able  to  account  for  the psychophysical results.",

However,  if the resolution is so low that the objects have few  dis(cid:173) tinguishing  features,  search  becomes  difficult.  We  show  that  the  performance of search at such low resolutions can be improved by using  context information, i.e., objects visible at low-resolution which are not  the objects of interest but are associated with them. The networks can be  given explicit context information as inputs, or they can learn to detect  the context objects, in which case the user does not have to be aware of  their existence. We also use Integrated Feature Pyramids, which repre(cid:173) sent high-frequency  information  at low  resolutions.  The use of multi(cid:173) resolution search techniques allows us to combine information about the  appearance of the objects on many scales in an efficient way.  A natural  fOlm  of exemplar selection also arises from these  techniques.

While this  property  has  been  studied  exten(cid:173) sively  in  the  neural  network  literature  it  has  not  been  thoroughly  explored in human perceptual and motor learning.  We have chosen  a  coordinate  transformation  system-the  visuomotor  map  which  transforms visual coordinates into motor coordinates-to study the  generalization effects  of learning new  input-output  pairs.  Using  a  paradigm of computer  controlled  altered  visual  feedback,  we  have  studied  the  generalization  of the  visuomotor  map  subsequent  to  both local  and context-dependent  remappings.  A  local  remapping  of one  or  two  input-output  pairs  induced  a  significant  global,  yet  decaying,  change  in  the  visuomotor map, suggesting  a  representa(cid:173) tion for  the  map composed of units  with large functional  receptive  fields.  Our study of context-dependent  remappings indicated that  a  single  point  in  visual  space  can  be  mapped to  two different  fin(cid:173) ger  locations  depending  on  a  context  variable-the starting  point  of  the  movement.  Furthermore,  as  the  context  is  varied  there  is  a  gradual  shift  between  the  two  remappings,  consistent  with  two  visuomotor  modules  being  learned  and  gated  smoothly  with  the  context.",

Recognition  error  of phone  units  from  the  acoustic-phonetic  continuous  speech  corpus  APASCI  is  decreased  with an adaptability ratio of 25%.  We used  local basis networks of  elliptical  Gaussian  kernels,  with  recursive  allocation  of units  and  on-line  optimization of parameters  (GRAN model).  For  this  ap(cid:173) plication,  the  model included  a  linear  term.  The results  compare  favorably  with  multivariate linear  mapping based  on  constrained  orthonormal transformations.",

However, anatomical studies show  that up to 90 % of the excitatory synaptic input onto any corti(cid:173) cal cell is provided by other cortical cells.

The Kohonen type  learning rule serves to adjust the synaptic weight vectors while Hebbian  learning  establishes  a  dynamic  lateral  connection  structure  between  the units reflecting the topology of the feature manifold. In case of super(cid:173) vised learning, i.e. function approximation, each neural unit implements  a Radial Basis Function, and an  additional layer of linear output units  adjusts according to a delta-rule. DCS is the first RBF-based approxima(cid:173) tion  scheme attempting to concurrently learn and  utilize a perfectly to(cid:173) pology preserving map for improved performance.  Simulations on a selection of CMU-Benchmarks indicate that the DCS  idea applied to the Growing Cell Structure algorithm [Fritzke93] leads  to an  efficient and elegant algorithm  that can  beat conventional  models  on similar tasks.",

        "abstract": "The auditory system of the barn owl contains several spatial maps.  In young barn owls raised with optical prisms over their eyes, these  auditory maps are shifted to stay in register with the visual map,  suggesting that the visual input imposes a frame of reference on  the auditory maps. However, the optic tectum, the first site of  convergence of visual with auditory information, is not the site of  plasticity for the shift of the auditory maps; the plasticity occurs  instead in the inferior colliculus, which contains an auditory map  and projects into the optic tectum. We explored a model of the owl  remapping in which a global reinforcement signal whose delivery is  controlled by visual foveation. A hebb learning rule gated by rein(cid:173) forcement learned to appropriately adjust auditory maps. In addi(cid:173) tion, reinforcement learning preferentially adjusted the weights in  the inferior colliculus, as in the owl brain, even though the weights  were allowed to change throughout the auditory system. This ob(cid:173) servation raises the possibility that the site of learning does not  have to be genetically specified, but could be determined by how  the learning procedure interacts with the network architecture.",

Learning from hints is a gen(cid:173) eralization of learning from examples where additional information  about the target function can be incorporated in the same learning  process. Such information can come from common sense rules or  special expertise. In financial market applications where the train(cid:173) ing data is very noisy, the use of such hints can have a decisive  advantage. We demonstrate the use of hints in foreign-exchange  trading of the U.S. Dollar versus the British Pound, the German  Mark, the Japanese Yen, and the Swiss Franc, over a period of 32  months. We explain the general method of learning from hints and  how it can be applied to other markets. The learning model for  this method is not restricted to neural networks.",

        "abstract": "We introduce a novel algorithm for factorial learning, motivated  by segmentation problems in computational vision, in which the  underlying factors correspond to clusters of highly correlated input  features. The algorithm derives from a new kind of competitive  clustering model, in which the cluster generators compete to ex(cid:173) plain each feature of the data set and cooperate to explain each  input example, rather than competing for examples and cooper(cid:173) ating on features, as in traditional clustering algorithms. A natu(cid:173) ral extension of the algorithm recovers hierarchical models of data  generated from multiple unknown categories, each with a differ(cid:173) ent, multiple causal structure. Several simulations demonstrate  the power of this approach.",

To scale reinforcement learning  to complex real-world tasks, such as typically studied in AI, one must ultimately be able  to discover the structure in the world, in order to abstract away the myriad of details and  to operate in more tractable problem spaces.  This paper presents the SKILLS algorithm.  SKILLS discovers skills, which are partially  defined action policies that arise in the context of multiple, related tasks.  Skills collapse  whole action sequences into single operators.  They are learned by minimizing the com(cid:173) pactness of action policies, using a description length argument on their representation.  Empirical results  in  simple grid  navigation tasks  illustrate the successful  discovery  of  structure in reinforcement learning.",

        "abstract": "Glove-TaikII is  a  system which  translates  hand gestures  to speech  through  an  adaptive interface.  Hand  gestures  are  mapped  contin(cid:173) uously  to  10  control  parameters  of a  parallel formant  speech  syn(cid:173) thesizer.  The mapping allows the hand to act  as  an  artificial  vocal  tract  that  produces  speech  in  real  time.  This  gives  an  unlimited  vocabulary  in addition to direct  control of fundamental  frequency  and  volume.  Currently,  the  best  version  of Glove-TalkII  uses  sev(cid:173) eral  input  devices  (including  a  CyberGlove,  a  ContactGlove,  a  3- space  tracker,  and a foot-pedal),  a  parallel formant speech  synthe(cid:173) sizer  and  3 neural  networks.  The gesture-to-speech  task  is  divided  into  vowel  and  consonant  production  by  using  a  gating  network  to weight  the outputs of a  vowel  and  a  consonant  neural  network.  The  gating  network  and  the  consonant  network  are  trained  with  examples  from  the  user.

        "abstract": "Many  cells  in  the  dorsal  part  of  the  medial  superior  temporal  (MST)  area  of  visual  cortex  respond  selectively  to  spiral  flow  patterns-specific  combinations of expansion/ contraction  and  ro(cid:173) tation  motions.  Previous  investigators  have  suggested  that  these  cells  may represent  self-motion.  Spiral patterns  can  also  be  gener(cid:173) ated by the relative motion of the observer  and a particular object.  An  MST  cell  may  then  account  for  some  portion  of the  complex  flow  field,  and  the  set  of active  cells  could  encode  the  entire  flow;  in  this  manner,  MST  effectively  segments  moving  objects.  Such  a  grouping operation  is  essential  in  interpreting  scenes  containing  several  independent  moving objects  and  observer  motion.  We  de(cid:173) scribe  a  model  based  on  the  hypothesis  that  the  selective  tuning  of MST  cells  reflects  the grouping of object  components  undergo(cid:173) ing  coherent  motion.  Inputs  to  the  model  were  generated  from  sequences  of ray-traced  images that simulated realistic  motion sit(cid:173) uations,  combining observer  motion, eye  movements, and indepen(cid:173) dent  object  motion.  The  input  representation  was  modeled  after  response  properties of neurons in area MT,  which provides the pri(cid:173) mary input to area MST.  After  applying an  unsupervised  learning  algorithm,  the  units  became  tuned  to  patterns  signaling  coherent  motion.  The results  match many of the  known  properties  of MST  cells  and  are  consistent  with  recent  studies  indicating  that  these  cells  process  3-D  object  motion information.",

The  resulting  system  can  be  thought of as a continuous-density HMM system, but instead of using gaussian  mixtures,  the HME system employs a large set of hierarchically organized but  relatively  small  neural  networks  to  perform the probability density estimation.  The  hierarchical  structure  is  reminiscent  of  a  decision  tree  except  for  two  important differences:  each  \"expert\" or neural  net  performs a  \"soft\" decision  rather than a hard decision, and,  unlike ordinary decision trees,  the parameters  of all  the  neural  nets  in  the  HME  are  automatically  trainable  using  the  EM  algorithm.

The model developed performs nonlin(cid:173) ear decorrelation up to higher orders of the cumulant tensors and results  in probabilistic ally independent components of the output layer. This  means that we don't need to assume Gaussian distribution neither at the  input nor at the output. The theory presented is related to the unsuper(cid:173) vised-learning theory of Barlow, which proposes redundancy reduction  as the goal of cognition. When nonlinear units are used nonlinear princi(cid:173) pal component analysis is obtained. In this case nonlinear manifolds can  be reduced to minimum dimension manifolds. If such units are used the  network performs a generalized principal component analysis in the  sense that non-Gaussian distributions can be linearly decorrelated and  higher orders of the correlation tensors are also taken into account. The  basic structure of the architecture involves a general transfOlmation that  is volume conserving and therefore the entropy, yielding a map without  loss of infoIIDation. Minimization of the mutual infoIIDation among the  output neurons eliminates the redundancy between the outputs and  results in statistical decorrelation of the extracted features. This is  known as factorialleaming.",

Analogue tech(cid:173) niques were chosen to meet the strict power and area requirements  of an Implantable Cardioverter Defibrillator (ICD) system.  The ro(cid:173) bustness  of the neural network  architecture  reduces  the impact of  noise,  drift  and offsets  inherent  in  analogue approaches.

We  show  that  as  humans  practice  reaching  movements while  interacting  with  a  novel  mechanical environment, they learn an  internal model of the  inverse dynamics of that environment.  Subjects show recall of this  model  at testing  sessions  24  hours  after  the  initial practice.  The  representation  of the internal model in  memory is  such  that there  is  interference  when  there  is  an  attempt  to  learn  a  new  inverse  dynamics  map  immediately after  an  anticorrelated  mapping  was  learned.  We  suggest  that  this  interference  is  an  indication  that  the same computational elements  used  to encode  the first  inverse  dynamics  map  are  being  used  to  learn  the  second  mapping.  We  predict  that this leads to a forgetting  of the initially learned skill.",

Using the same approach, a much sim(cid:173) pler  learning  procedure is  proposed  here  which  discovers  features  in a single-layer network consisting of several populations of units,  and  can  be  applied  to  multi-layer  networks  trained  one  layer  at  a  time.

We approach this problem by applying a maximum(cid:173) likelihood framework to an assumed distribution of errors.  We demon(cid:173) strate our method first on computer-generated data with locally varying,  normally distributed target noise.  We then apply it to laser data from the  Santa Fe  Time  Series Competition where the underlying system noise is  known quantization error and the error bars give local estimates of model  misspecification.  In  both  cases,  the method also provides a  weighted(cid:173) regression effect that improves generalization performance.",

As  a  prototypical scenario of this  kind,  we  consider  a  linear  perceptron  student  learning a  binary  perceptron  teacher.  Two kinds of queries for  maximum information gain,  i.e.,  minimum entropy,  are  investigated:  Minimum  student  space  en(cid:173) tropy  (MSSE)  queries,  which  are  appropriate  if the  teacher  space  is  unknown,  and  minimum teacher  space entropy  (MTSE)  queries,  which can be used  if the teacher space is  assumed to be known, but  a student of a simpler form  has deliberately  been  chosen.

We  first  rederive the  known results for  the 'thermodynamic limit' of infinite  perceptron  size  N  and  show  explicitly  that  9  is  self-averaging  in  this limit.  We  then discuss extensions of our  method to  more gen(cid:173) eral  learning scenarios with  anisotropic teacher  space priors,  input  distributions, and weight  decay  terms.  Finally, we  use our method  to calculate the  finite  N  corrections of order  1/ N  to G  and discuss  the corresponding  finite  size  effects  on generalization  and learning  dynamics.  An  important  spin-off  is  the  observation  that  results  obtained  in  the  thermodynamic limit are often  directly  relevant  to  systems of fairly  modest, 'real-world' sizes.",

In particular, prediction of parameterised speech over  short time segments is performed using the Hierarchical Mixture of  Experts (HME) (Jordan & Jacobs 1994). The HME gives two ad(cid:173) vantages over traditional non-linear function approximators such  as the Multi-Layer Percept ron (MLP); a statistical understand(cid:173) ing of the operation of the predictor and provision of information  about the performance of the predictor in the form of likelihood  information and local error bars. These two issues are examined  on both toy and real world problems of regression and time series  prediction. In the speech coding context, we extend the principle  of combining local predictions via the HME to a Vector Quantiza(cid:173) tion scheme in which fixed local codebooks are combined on-line  for each observation.",

The central idea we explore is  that the con(cid:173) tents  of consciousness  correspond  to  temporally  persistent  states  in a  network of computational modules.  Three simulations are de(cid:173) scribed  illustrating  that  the  behavior  of  persistent  states  in  the  models  corresponds  roughly  to  the  behavior  of  conscious  states  people  experience when  performing similar tasks.

        "abstract": "The performance of on-line algorithms for learning dichotomies is studied. In on-line learn(cid:173) ing, the number of examples P is equivalent to the learning time, since each example is  presented only once. The learning curve, or generalization error as a function of P, depends  on the schedule at which the learning rate is lowered. For a target that is a perceptron rule,  the learning curve of the perceptron algorithm can decrease as fast as p- 1 , if the sched(cid:173) ule is optimized. If the target is not realizable by a perceptron, the perceptron algorithm  does not generally converge to the solution with lowest generalization error. For the case  of unrealizability due to a simple output noise, we propose a new on-line algorithm for a  perceptron yielding a learning curve that can approach the optimal generalization error as  fast as p-l/2. We then generalize the perceptron algorithm to any class of thresholded  smooth functions learning a target from that class. For \"well-behaved\" input distributions,  if this algorithm converges to the optimal solution, its learning curve can decrease as fast  as p-l.",

Motivated  by  this  consideration,  we  present  a  simple  analytical  framework for  estimating the functional  damage resulting from fo(cid:173) cal  structural  lesions  to  a  neural  network.

Although our analyti(cid:173) cal results are based on some approximations, they correspond well  with simulation results.  This study sheds light on  some important  features  characterizing  the  clinical  manifestations of multi-infarct  dementia, including the strong  association between  the number of  infarcts and the prevalence of dementia after stroke,  and the 'mul(cid:173) tiplicative' interaction that has been  postulated  to occur  between  Alzheimer's disease  and multi-infarct dementia.",

MLP networks with no hidden layer and  networks  with one hidden  layer were trained  using  stochastic  gradient  descent with early stopping. MLP networks and logistic regression used  the  same  input  features  and  were  evaluated  using  bootstrap  sampling  with  50  replications.  ROC  areas  for  predicting  mortality  using  preoperative  input  features  were  70.5%  for  logistic  regression  and  76.0%  for  MLP  networks.  Regularization  provided  by  early  stopping  was  an  important  component  of improved  perfonnance.  A  simplified  approach  to  generating  confidence  intervals  for  MLP risk  predictions  using  an  auxiliary  \"confidence  MLP\"  was  developed.  The  confidence  MLP  is  trained  to  reproduce  confidence  intervals  that  were  generated  during  training  using  the  outputs  of  50  MLP  networks  trained  with  different bootstrap samples.",

If the  Markov  assumption  is  removed,  however,  neither  generally  the  algorithms  nor  the  analyses  continue  to  be  usable.  We  propose  and  analyze  a  new  learning  algorithm  to  solve  a  certain  class  of  non-Markov  decision  problems.  Our  algorithm  applies  to  problems  in  which  the  environment  is  Markov,  but  the  learner  has  restricted  access  to  state  information.  The  algorithm involves  a  Monte-Carlo  pol(cid:173) icy evaluation combined with a  policy improvement method that is  similar to  that  of Markov  decision  problems  and  is  guaranteed  to  converge to a local maximum.  The algorithm operates in the space  of stochastic  policies,  a  space  which  can  yield  a  policy  that  per(cid:173) forms  considerably  better  than any deterministic policy.  Although  the  space  of stochastic  policies  is  continuous-even  for  a  discrete  action space-our algorithm is computationally tractable.",

        "abstract": "The auditory system of the barn owl  contains several spatial maps.  In young barn owls raised with optical prisms over their eyes,  these  auditory  maps are  shifted  to stay  in  register  with the  visual  map,  suggesting  that  the  visual  input  imposes  a  frame  of reference  on  the  auditory  maps.  However,  the  optic  tectum,  the  first  site  of  convergence  of visual  with  auditory information, is  not the  site  of  plasticity for  the  shift  of the  auditory  maps;  the  plasticity occurs  instead  in  the  inferior  colliculus, which  contains  an  auditory  map  and projects into the optic tectum.  We explored a model of the owl  remapping in which  a global reinforcement signal whose  delivery  is  controlled  by  visual foveation.  A hebb  learning rule gated by  rein(cid:173) forcement  learned  to appropriately adjust auditory  maps.  In addi(cid:173) tion,  reinforcement  learning  preferentially  adjusted  the  weights  in  the inferior colliculus,  as in the owl brain, even  though the weights  were  allowed  to  change  throughout  the auditory system.  This ob(cid:173) servation  raises  the  possibility  that  the  site  of learning  does  not  have  to  be  genetically specified,  but  could  be  determined  by  how  the learning procedure  interacts with the network  architecture.",

SARDNET yields extremely dense  yet descriptive representations of sequential input in very few  train(cid:173) ing  iterations.  The  network  has  proven  successful  on  mapping ar(cid:173) bitrary sequences  of binary and real numbers,  as well  as  phonemic  representations  of  English  words.

The algorithm searches for  large connected regions of so-called ''fiat'' minima of the error func(cid:173) tion. In the weight-space environment of a \"flat\" minimum, the  error remains approximately constant. Using an MDL-based ar(cid:173) gument, flat minima can be shown to correspond to low expected  overfitting. Although our algorithm requires the computation of  second order derivatives, it has backprop's order of complexity.  Experiments with feedforward and recurrent nets are described. In  an application to stock market prediction, the method outperforms  conventional backprop, weight decay, and \"optimal brain surgeon\" .",

The single  transistor  synapses  simultaneously  perform long  term  weight  storage,  com(cid:173) pute the product of the input and the weight value, and update the  weight value according to a Hebbian or a backpropagation learning  rule.  Memory  is  accomplished  via  charge  storage  on  polysilicon  floating  gates, providing long-term  retention without refresh.  The  synapses efficiently use the physics of silicon to perform weight  up(cid:173) dates; the weight value is  increased using tunneling and the weight  value  decreases  using  hot  electron  injection.  The  small  size  and  low  power operation of single transistor synapses allows  the devel(cid:173) opment  of  dense  synaptic  arrays.  We  describe  the  design,  fabri(cid:173) cation,  characterization,  and  modeling  of an  array  of single  tran(cid:173) sistor  synapses.

We  propose  an  alternative  approach  to  spatial  perception  of objects  in  the  pari(cid:173) etal  cortex from  the  perspective  of sensorimotor  transformations.  The responses of single parietal neurons can be modeled as  a gaus(cid:173) sian  function  of retinal  position  multiplied by  a  sigmoid function  of eye  position,  which  form  a  set of basis functions.  We  show  here  how  these  basis functions  can  be  used  to generate  receptive  fields  in  either  retinotopic or head-centered  coordinates by simple linear  transformations.  This raises the possibility that the parietal cortex  does  not  attempt to compute the positions of objects  in  a  partic(cid:173) ular  frame  of  reference  but  instead  computes  a  general  purpose  representation  of the retinal  location and eye  position from  which  any  transformation can  be  synthesized  by  direct  projection.  This  representation  predicts that hemineglect,  a  neurological syndrome  produced  by  parietal lesions,  should  not  be  confined  to egocentric  coordinates,  but should be observed in multiple frames of reference  in  single patients,  a  prediction supported  by several experiments.",

        "abstract": "An novel class of locally excitatory, globally inhibitory oscillator  networks is proposed. The model of each oscillator corresponds to a  standard relaxation oscillator with two time scales. The network  exhibits a mechanism of selective gating, whereby an oscillator  jumping up to its active phase rapidly recruits the oscillators stimulated  by the same pattern, while preventing others from jumping up. We  show analytically that with the selective gating mechanism the network  rapidly achieves both synchronization within blocks of oscillators that  are stimulated by connected regions and desynchronization between  different blocks. Computer simulations demonstrate the network's  promising ability for segmenting multiple input patterns in real time.  This model lays a physical foundation for the oscillatory correlation  theory of feature binding, and may provide an effective computational  framework for scene segmentation and figure/ground segregation.",

        "abstract": "Casting  neural  network  weights  in  symbolic  terms  is  crucial  for  interpreting  and explaining  the  behavior of a network.  Additionally,  in  some  domains,  a  symbolic  description  may  lead  to  more  robust  generalization.  We  present  a  principled  approach  to  symbolic  rule  extraction  based  on  the  notion  of  weight  templates,  parameterized  regions of weight space corresponding to specific symbolic expressions.  With  an  appropriate  choice  of representation,  we  show  how  template  parameters  may  be  efficiently  identified  and  instantiated  to  yield  the  optimal match to a unit's actual weights. Depending on the requirements  of  the  application  domain,  our  method  can  accommodate  arbitrary  disjunctions  and  conjunctions  with  O(k)  complexity,  simple  n-of-m  expressions with O( k!) complexity, or a more general class of recursive  n-of-m  expressions  with  O(k!)  complexity,  where  k  is  the  number  of  inputs  to  a  unit.  Our method  of rule  extraction  offers  several  benefits  over alternative approaches in the literature, and simulation results on  a  variety of problems demonstrate its effectiveness.",

Our preprocessing transforms the  original coordinate sequence into a (still temporal) sequence offea(cid:173) ture vectors, which combine strictly local features, like curvature  or writing direction, with a bitmap-like representation of the co(cid:173) ordinate's proximity. The MS-TDNN architecture is well suited  for handling temporal sequences as provided by this input rep(cid:173) resentation. Our system is tested both on writer dependent and  writer independent tasks with vocabulary sizes ranging from 400  up to 20,000 words.

The  scheme  exploits  an  auto-associative network's ability to encode each view of a single object  into a representation that indicates its view direction.  We propose two  models that employ different classification mechanisms; the first model  selects an auto-associative network whose recovered view best matches  the input view, and the second model is based on a modular architecture  whose  additional  network classifies  the  views  by  splitting  the  input  space  nonlinearly.  We demonstrate  the  effectiveness  of the  proposed  classification models through simulations using 3D wire-frame objects.",

        "abstract": "Speech  recognizers  provide  good  performance  for  most  users  but  the  error rate often  increases dramatically  for a small  percentage of talkers  who are \"different\" from  those talkers used for training.  One expensive  solution to  this problem is  to  gather more training data in an attempt to  sample these outlier users. A second solution, explored in this paper,  is  to artificially enlarge the number of training talkers by transforming the  speech of existing training talkers. This approach is similar to enlarging  the training set for  OCR digit recognition  by  warping the training digit  images,  but  is  more  difficult  because  continuous  speech  has  a  much  larger number of dimensions  (e.g.  linguistic,  phonetic,  style,  temporal,  spectral) that differ across talkers. We explored the use of simple linear  spectral warping to enlarge a 48-talker training data base used for  word  spotting.  The  average  detection  rate  overall  was  increased  by  2.9  percentage  points  (from  68.3%  to  71.2%)  for  male  speakers  and  2.5  percentage  points  (from  64.8%  to  67.3%)  for  female  speakers.  This  increase is  small but similar to  that obtained by  doubling the amount of  training data.",

In this paper  we present a simple method of achieving spatial selective attention through  the use of a saliency map. The saliency map indicates which regions of the  input retina are important for performing the task. The saliency map is cre(cid:173) ated through predictive auto-encoding. The performance of this method is  demonstrated on two simple tasks which have multiple very strong distract(cid:173) ing features in the input retina.

The  task  at  hand  is  recognition  of the  first  four  English  digits,  a  task  with  possible  applications  in  car-phone  images  were  modeled  as  mixtures  of  independent  dialing.  The  Gaussian  distributions,  and  the  temporal  dependencies  were  captured  with standard left-to-right hidden Markov  models.  The  results  indicate  that  simple  hidden  Markov  models  may  be  used  to  successfully  recognize relatively unprocessed image sequences. The system  achieved  performance  levels  equivalent  to  untrained  humans  when  asked  to  recognize the fIrst four English digits.",
