        "abstract": "Converging  evidence  has  shown  that  human  object  recognition  depends  on  familiarity  with  the  images  of  an  object.  Further,  the  greater  the  similarity  between  objects,  the  stronger  is  the  dependence  on  object  appearance,  and  the  more  important  two(cid:173) dimensional (2D) image information becomes.  These findings,  how(cid:173) ever, do not rule out the use of 3D structural information in recog(cid:173) nition,  and  the  degree  to  which  3D  information  is  used  in  visual  memory is an important issue.  Liu, Knill, & Kersten (1995) showed  that  any model  that  is  restricted  to  rotations  in  the  image  plane  of independent  2D  templates  could not  account for  human perfor(cid:173) mance in discriminating novel object views.  We now present results  from models of generalized radial basis functions  (GRBF), 2D near(cid:173) est  neighbor  matching that  allows  2D  affine  transformations,  and  a Bayesian statistical estimator that integrates over all possible 2D  affine  transformations.  The  performance  of the  human  observers  relative  to  each  of  the  models  is  better for  the  novel  views  than  for  the familiar  template views,  suggesting that humans generalize  better to novel  views  from  template views.  The  Bayesian estima(cid:173) tor yields the optimal performance with  2D  affine  transformations  and  independent  2D  templates.  Therefore,  models  of  2D  affine  matching  operations  with  independent  2D  templates  are unlikely  to account for  human recognition performance.",

In this paper, the shape that such a gradient might  have is calculated as a function of distance from the target and the  time since  the start of factor production.  Using estimates  of the  relevant parameter values  from  the  experimental literature,  the  spatiotemporal domain in which a growth cone could detect such  a  gradient is derived.  For large times, a  value for the maximum  guidance range  of about 1 mm is  obtained.  This value fits  well  with experimental data.  For smaller times,  the  analysis predicts  that guidance over longer ranges may be possible. This prediction  remains to be tested.",

It uses real time graphical user inputs or an auxiliary infrared detector as supervisory signals to train a convolutional neural network. The inputs to the neural network consist of normalized luminance and chrominance images and motion information from frame differences. Subsampled images are also used to provide scale invariance. During the online training phases the neural network rapidly adjusts the input weights depending up on the reliability of the different channels in the surrounding environment. This quick adaptation allows the system to robustly track a head even when other objects are moving within a cluttered background.",

In particular,  the  recurrent  neural  network  can be trained using the real-time recurrent learning rule and  the linear  error model  can be trained by an EM  adaptation rule,  implemented us(cid:173) ing forward-backward Kalman filter equations. The model is applied to  predict the glucose/insulin metabolism of a diabetic patient where blood  glucose measurements  are  only available a few  times a day  at  irregular  intervals.

We explore this explanation for optic aphasia, a disorder in which  severe  perfonnance  deficits  are  observed  when  patients  are  asked  to  name  visually  presented objects, but  surprisingly,  performance  is  rela(cid:173) tively  nonnal  on  naming  objects  from  auditory  cues  and  on  gesturing  the appropriate use  of visually  presented objects.  We  model  this  highly  specific deficit through partial damage to two pathways-one that maps  visual  input to  semantics, and  the other that maps semantics  to  naming  responses.  The  effect  of  this  damage  is  superadditive,  meaning  that  tasks  which  require  one  pathway  or the  other show  little  or  no  perfor(cid:173) mance  deficit,  but the  damage  is  manifested  when  a  task  requires  both  pathways (i.e.,  naming  visually  presented objects).  Our model explains  other  phenomena  associated  with  optic  aphasia,  and  makes  testable  experimental predictions.",

The first  stage of visual motion  processing in flies is  a retinotopic array of functional units known as  el(cid:173) ementary motion detectors (EMDs).  Several decades ago, Reichardt and  colleagues developed a correlation-based model of motion detection that  described the behavior of these neural circuits.  We  have implemented a  variant of this model in a 2.0-JLm  analog CMOS VLSI process.  The re(cid:173) sult is a low-power, continuous-time analog circuit with integrated pho(cid:173) toreceptors that responds to motion in real  time.  The  responses of the  circuit to drifting sinusoidal gratings qualitatively resemble the temporal  frequency response, spatial frequency response, and direction selectivity  of motion-sensitive neurons observed in insects.

        "abstract": "We  derive  and  analyse  robust  optimization  schemes  for  noisy  vector  quantization  on  the  basis  of deterministic  annealing.  Starting  from  a  cost  function  for  central  clustering  that  incorporates  distortions  from  channel  noise  we  develop  a  soft  topographic  vector  quantization  al(cid:173) gorithm  (STVQ)  which  is  based  on  the  maximum  entropy  principle  and which performs a maximum-likelihood estimate in  an expectation(cid:173) maximization (EM) fashion.  Annealing in the temperature parameter f3  leads to phase transitions in the existing code vector representation dur(cid:173) ing the cooling process for which we  calculate critical temperatures and  modes  as  a function of eigenvectors  and eigenvalues  of the covariance  matrix of the data and the transition matrix of the channel noise.  A whole  family  of vector quantization algorithms is derived from  STVQ, among  them  a  deterministic  annealing  scheme  for  Kohonen's  self-organizing  map  (SOM).  This  algorithm,  which  we  call  SSOM,  is  then  applied  to  vector quantization of image data to be sent via a noisy binary symmetric  channel.  The algorithm's performance is compared to those of LBG and  STVQ.  While it is  naturally superior to LBG, which does  not take into  account channel noise, its results compare very  well  to those of STVQ,  which is computationally much more demanding.",

One  of the  key  issues  arising  from  any  mixture  model  application  is  how  to  es(cid:173) timate  the  optimum  number  of mixture  components.  This  paper  extends the Reversible-Jump Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC)  algorithm  to the  case of multivariate spherical  Gaussian  mixtures  using  a  hierarchical  prior  model.  Using  this  method  the  number  of mixture  components  is  no  longer  fixed  but  becomes  a  param(cid:173) eter of the  model  which  we  shall estimate.  The Reversible-Jump  MCMC  algorithm  is  capable  of  moving  between  parameter  sub(cid:173) spaces which  correspond to models  with different  numbers of mix(cid:173) ture components.  As  a result a  sample from  the full joint distribu(cid:173) tion of all  unknown model parameters is generated.  The technique  is  then  demonstrated  on  a  simulated  example  and  a  well  known  vowel dataset.",

The main question we  address is whether the asymptotic  behavior is  governed  by  the architecture,  regardless  the details  of  the  weights .  We  find  hierarchies  among  classes  of  architectures  with  respect  to the attract or dimension  of the long term sequence  they are capable of generating;  larger number of hidden  units  can  generate higher dimensional attractors.  In the case of a perceptron,  we  develop  the  stationary  solution  for  general  weights,  and  show  that  the  flow  is  typically  one  dimensional.  The  relaxation  time  from  an  arbitrary  initial  condition  to  the  stationary  solution  is  found  to scale linearly with the size  of the network.  In multilayer  networks, the number of hidden units gives bounds on the number  and  dimension  of the  possible  attractors.  We  conclude that  long  term  prediction  (in  the  non-chaotic  regime)  with  such  models  is  governed by attractor dynamics related to the architecture.",

        "abstract": "Exact inference in densely connected Bayesian networks is computation(cid:173) ally intractable, and so there is considerable interest in developing effec(cid:173) tive approximation schemes. One approach which has been adopted is to  bound the log likelihood using a mean-field approximating distribution.  While this leads to a tractable algorithm, the mean field distribution is as(cid:173) sumed to be factorial and hence unimodal.  In this paper we demonstrate  the feasibility of using a richer class of approximating distributions based  on mixtures of mean field distributions.  We derive an efficient algorithm  for updating the mixture parameters and apply it to the problem of learn(cid:173) ing  in  sigmoid  belief networks.  Our results  demonstrate  a  systematic  improvement over  simple  mean  field  theory  as  the  number of mixture  components is increased.",

Through simulated control experience using a medium-fidelity aircraft  simulation, the RL system approximates an optimal policy for pitch-stick  inputs to produce minimum-time transitions to straight-and-Ievel flight in  unconstrained cases while avoiding ground-strike.

The  linear response  correction  to the  correlations is  given  by  the  Hessian  of the  Gibbs free  energy.  The  computational complexity of the  algorithm is  cubic  in  the number  of neurons.  We compare the performance of the exact BM learning  algorithm  with  first  order  (Weiss)  mean  field  theory  and  second  order  (TAP)  mean field  theory.  The learning task consists of a fully  connected  Ising spin glass  model on  10  neurons.  We conclude that  1)  the  method  works  well  for  paramagnetic problems  2)  the  TAP  correction gives a significant improvement over the Weiss mean field  theory,  both for  paramagnetic and spin glass problems and 3)  that  the inclusion of diagonal weights improves the Weiss approximation  for  paramagnetic problems , but not for spin  glass  problems.",

Moving bars have long been recognized as an optimal stimulus  for  many visual cortical neurons,  and this finding  has recently been  confirmed  and extended in detail using reverse correlation methods  (Jones and Palmer,  1987;  Reid  and Alonso,  1995; Reid  et al.,  1991;  llingach et al.,  1997).  In this study, we recorded from neurons in the  primary auditory cortex of the awake  primate,  and used  a  novel  re(cid:173) verse correlation technique to compute receptive fields  (or preferred  stimuli), encompassing both multiple frequency components and on(cid:173) going time.  These spectrotemporal receptive fields  make clear that  neurons in the primary auditory cortex, as in the primary visual cor(cid:173) tex, typically show considerable structure in their feature processing  properties, often including multiple excitatory and inhibitory regions  in their receptive fields.  These neurons can be sensitive to stimulus  edges in frequency  composition or in time,  and sensitive to stimulus  transitions  such as  changes in  frequency.  These  neurons  also  show  strong responses and selectivity to continuous frequency  modulated  stimuli analogous to visual drifting gratings.",

The  general  approach is  to create  a  set of learned models  by  repeatedly apply(cid:173) ing  the  algorithm  to  different  versions  of the  training  data,  and  then  combine  the  learned  models'  predictions  according  to  a  pre(cid:173) scribed voting scheme.  Little work has been done in combining the  predictions  of a  collection  of models  generated  by  many  learning  algorithms having different representation and/or search strategies.  This paper describes  a  method which  uses  the strategies of stack(cid:173) ing and correspondence analysis to model the relationship between  the  learning examples and  the way  in  which  they  are  classified  by  a collection  of learned models.  A nearest  neighbor method is  then  applied  within  the  resulting  representation  to  classify  previously  unseen examples.  The new  algorithm consistently performs as  well  or  better than other combining techniques on a suite of data sets.",

Using the fast events of biology in conjunction with  an  underlying rhythm  is  one  way  to  overcome the  limits  of an  event(cid:173) driven view of computation.

In this paper, we attempt to answer these ques(cid:173) tions in the context of a Kalman filter-based model of visual recognition that  has previously proved useful in explaining certain neurophysiological phe(cid:173) nomena such as endstopping and related extra-classical receptive field ef(cid:173) fects in the visual cortex. By using results from the field of robust statistics,  we describe an extension of the Kalman filter model that can handle multiple  objects in the visual field.  The resulting robust Kalman filter model demon(cid:173) strates how certain forms of attention can be viewed as an emergent prop(cid:173) erty of the interaction between top-down expectations and bottom-up sig(cid:173) nals.  The model also suggests functional interpretations of certain attention(cid:173) related effects that have been observed in visual cortical neurons.

        "abstract": "A novel neural network model of pre-attention processing in visual(cid:173) search  tasks  is  presented.  Using displays of line orientations taken  from  Wolfe's experiments  [1992], we  study the  hypothesis  that the  distinction  between  parallel  versus  serial  processes  arises  from  the  availability of global information in  the internal representations  of  the  visual  scene.  The  model  operates  in  two  phases.  First,  the  visual  displays  are  compressed  via  principal-component-analysis.  Second,  the compressed data is processed by a target detector mod(cid:173) ule in order to identify the existence of a  target in the display.  Our  main  finding  is  that  targets  in  displays  which  were  found  exper(cid:173) imentally  to  be  processed  in  parallel can  be  detected  by  the  sys(cid:173) tem,  while  targets  in  experimentally-serial  displays  cannot .  This  fundamental  difference  is  explained  via  variance  analysis  of  the  compressed representations,  providing a  numerical criterion distin(cid:173) guishing parallel from serial displays.  Our model yields a  mapping  of response-time slopes that is similar to Duncan and Humphreys's  \"search  surface\"  [1989],  providing  an  explicit  formulation  of their  intuitive  notion  of feature  similarity.  It presents  a  neural  realiza(cid:173) tion of the  processing that may underlie the classical metaphorical  explanations of visual search.",

Changes in  release probability represent one of the  main mechanisms by which synaptic efficacy is modulated in neural circuits.  We propose and investigate a simple model for dynamic stochastic synapses  that can  easily be  integrated into common models  for  neural computation.  We  show  through  computer  simulations  and  rigorous  theoretical  analysis  that  this  model  for  a  dynamic  stochastic synapse increases  computational  power in a nontrivial way.  Our results may have implications for the process(cid:173) ing of time-varying signals by both biological and artificial neural networks.",

When dissimilar images are  presented to the two eyes, however, perceptual integra(cid:173) tion gives way to alternation between monocular inputs,  a phenomenon called binocular rivalry. Although recent  evidence indicates that binocular rivalry involves a mod(cid:173) ulation of neuronal responses in extrastriate cortex, the  basic mechanisms responsible for differential processing of  con:6.icting and congruent stimuli remain unclear. Using a  neural network that models the mammalian early visual  system, I demonstrate here that the desynchronized fir(cid:173) ing of cortical-like neurons that first receive inputs from  the two eyes results in rivalrous activity patterns at later  stages in the visual pathway. By contrast, synchronization  of firing among these cells prevents such competition. The  temporal coordination of cortical activity and its effects  on neural competition emerge naturally from the network  connectivity and from its dynamics. These results suggest  that input-related differences in relative spike timing at  an early stage of visual processing may give rise to the  phenomena both of perceptual integration and rivalry in  binocular vision.",

A  third  approach,  called  ensemble  learning,  was  in(cid:173) troduced by Hinton and van  Camp  (1993).  It aims to approximate  the  posterior  distribution  by  minimizing  the  Kullback-Leibler  di(cid:173) vergence  between the true posterior and a parametric approximat(cid:173) ing distribution.  However,  the  derivation  of a  deterministic  algo(cid:173) rithm  relied  on  the  use  of a  Gaussian  approximating distribution  with  a  diagonal  covariance  matrix  and  so  was  unable  to capture  the  posterior  correlations  between  parameters.  In this  paper,  we  show  how the ensemble learning approach can  be extended to full(cid:173) covariance Gaussian distributions while remaining computationally  tractable.  We also extend the framework to deal with hyperparam(cid:173) eters,  leading  to  a  simple  re-estimation  procedure.  Initial  results  from  a standard benchmark problem are encouraging.",

The  reason  for  using Bayesian  learning for  this  task  is  two-fold.  First,  Bayesian  inference  is  known  to  embody  regularization  automati(cid:173) cally.  Second,  a  side  effect  of  Bayesian  learning  leads  to  larger  variance of network outputs in regions  without training data.  This  results  in  well  known  moderation  effects,  which  can  be  used  to  detect  outliers.  In  a  5  fold  cross-validation  experiment  the  full  Bayesian  solution  found  with  R.  Neals  hybrid  Monte  Carlo  algo(cid:173) rithm,  was  not  better than  a single maximum a-posteriori  (MAP)  solution found  with  D.J.  MacKay's  evidence  approximation.  In  a  second  experiment  we  studied  the  properties  of both  solutions  in  rejecting  classification of movement artefacts.",

        "abstract": "Severe  contamination  of  electroencephalographic  (EEG)  activity  by  eye  movements, blinks, muscle,  heart  and line noise is  a  serious  problem for  EEG  interpretation  and  analysis.  Rejecting  contami(cid:173) nated  EEG  segments  results  in  a  considerable  loss  of information  and may be impractical for  clinical data.  Many methods have been  proposed  to  remove  eye  movement  and  blink  artifacts  from  EEG  recordings.  Often  regression  in  the  time  or  frequency  domain  is  performed  on  simultaneous  EEG  and  electrooculographic  (EOG)  recordings  to derive  parameters characterizing the appearance and  spread  of  EOG  artifacts  in  the  EEG  channels.  However,  EOG  records  also contain brain signals [1,  2],  so  regressing  out EOG ac(cid:173) tivity inevitably involves subtracting a portion of the relevant EEG  signal  from each  recording  as  well.  Regression  cannot  be  used  to  remove  muscle  noise  or  line  noise,  since  these  have  no  reference  channels.  Here , we  propose a new and generally applicable method  for  removing  a  wide  variety  of artifacts  from  EEG  records.  The  method  is  based  on  an  extended  version  of  a  previous  Indepen(cid:173) dent  Component  Analysis  (lCA)  algorithm  [3,  4]  for  performing  blind  source  separation  on  linear  mixtures of independent  source  signals  with  either  sub-Gaussian  or  super-Gaussian  distributions.  Our  results  show  that ICA  can  effectively  detect,  separate and  re(cid:173) move  activity  in  EEG  records  from  a  wide  variety  of artifactual  sources,  with  results  comparing favorably  to  those  obtained  using  regression-based  methods.",

In  this  paper,  we  show  that  these  techniques  can  be  more  widely  applied,  by  representing  other  boolean  functions  as  two-layer neural  networks  (thresholded convex  combinations of  boolean functions).  For example, we show that with high probabil(cid:173) ity any decision tree of depth no more than d that is consistent with  m training examples has misclassification probability no more than  o ( (~ (Neff VCdim(U)  log2 m log d)) 1/2),  where U is  the  class  of  node  decision  functions,  and  Neff  ::;  N  can  be  thought  of as  the  effective  number of leaves  (it  becomes small  as  the distribution on  the  leaves  induced  by  the  training  data gets  far  from  uniform).  This  bound  is  qualitatively different  from  the VC  bound  and  can  be considerably smaller.  We use the same technique to give similar results for DNF formulae.",

        "abstract": "Prioritized sweeping  is  a  model-based  reinforcement learning  method  that  attempts  to  focus  an  agent's  limited  computational  resources  to  achieve a good estimate of the value of environment states.  To choose ef(cid:173) fectively where to spend a costly planning step, classic prioritized sweep(cid:173) ing  uses  a simple  heuristic  to  focus  computation on  the  states  that are  likely to have the largest errors.  In this paper, we  introduce generalized  prioritized sweeping, a principled method for generating such estimates  in a representation-specific manner.  This allows us to extend prioritized  sweeping beyond an explicit, state-based representation to deal with com(cid:173) pact representations that are necessary for dealing with large state spaces.  We  apply  this  method  for  generalized  model  approximators  (such  as  Bayesian networks), and describe preliminary experiments that compare  our approach with classical prioritized sweeping.",

This  hybrid system is an extension of a state-of-the-art continuous HMM sys(cid:173) tem, and in fact, it is the first hybrid system that really is capable of outper(cid:173) forming these standard systems with respect to the recognition accuracy.  Experimental results show an relative error reduction of about 10% that  we achieved on a remarkably good recognition system based on continu(cid:173) ous HMMs for the Resource Management 1 OOO-word continuous speech  recognition task.",

When it was trained by a  2-step learning (during the first  learning  step, the selection module was trained by a training procedure con(cid:173) trolled  only  by  the  linear  controller),  it  learned  the  control  more  quickly.  The average  number of trials  (about  50)  is  so small  that  the learning system is  applicable to real robot control.",

A  good way  to  detect illegitimate use is  through monitoring unusual user  activity. Methods of intrusion detection based on hand-coded rule sets or  predicting commands on-line are laborous to build or not very reliable.  This  paper proposes  a new  way  of applying neural  networks  to  detect  intrusions. We believe that a user leaves a 'print' when using the system;  a neural network can  be  used  to learn this  print and  identify  each  user  much like detectives use thumbprints to place people at crime scenes.  If  a user's behavior does not match hislher print, the system administrator  can be alerted of a possible security breech.  A backpropagation neural  network called NNID  (Neural Network Intrusion Detector) was trained  in  the  identification  task  and  tested  experimentally  on  a  system  of 10  users.  The system was 96%  accurate in detecting unusual activity,  with  7%  false  alarm rate.  These results suggest that learning user profiles is  an effective way for detecting intrusions.",

Training  monkeys with novel,  paperclip-like objects, Logothetis et al. 9  could in(cid:173) vestigate whether these invariance properties are due to experience with  exhaustively many transformed instances of an object or if there are mech(cid:173) anisms that allow the cells to show response invariance also to previously  unseen instances of that object.  They found object-selective cells in an(cid:173) terior IT which exhibited limited invariance  to various transformations  after training with single object views.  While previous models accounted  for  the tuning of the  cells  for  rotations  in  depth and  for  their selectiv(cid:173) ity  to a  specific  object relative to a population of distractor objects,14,1  the model described here attempts to explain in a  biologically plausible  way  the additional properties of translation  and  size  invariance.  Using  the  same  stimuli  as  in  the  experiment,  we  find  that model  IT neurons  exhibit invariance properties which closely parallel those of real neurons.  Simulations show that the model  is capable of unsupervised learning of  view-tuned neurons.",

In  the standard depiction of the  network's state space, memories of objects are stored as attractive fixed  points of the dynamics.  I argue for  a  modification of this picture:  if an  object has a continuous family of instantiations, it should be represented  by  a  continuous  attractor.  This  idea is  illustrated with  a  network  that  learns to complete patterns.  To  perform the task of filling  in missing in(cid:173) formation,  the network develops a  continuous attractor that models the  manifold  from  which  the patterns  are  drawn.  From  a  statistical  view(cid:173) point, the pattern completion task allows  a  formulation of unsupervised  learning in  terms of regression  rather than density estimation.",

SVD  was used to learn and represent relations among  very large numbers  of  words  (20k-60k)  and  very  large numbers  of natural  text  passages  (lk- 70k)  in  which  they  occurred.  The  result  was  100-350  dimensional  \"semantic spaces\" in which any trained or newly aibl word or passage  could be represented as  a vector,  and  similarities  were measured by  the  cosine  of  the  contained  angle  between  vectors.

Here we consider the problem of learning how to order, given feedback  in the form of preference judgments, i.e., statements to the effect that one instance  should be ranked ahead of another.  We outline a two-stage approach in which one  first learns by conventional means a preference Junction, of the form PREF( u, v),  which  indicates  whether  it is advisable  to  rank  u  before  v.  New  instances  are  then  ordered  so  as  to  maximize  agreements  with  the  learned  preference  func(cid:173) tion.  We  show  that  the  problem  of finding  the  ordering  that  agrees  best  with  a preference function  is  NP-complete,  even under very  restrictive assumptions.  Nevertheless, we describe a simple greedy algorithm that is guaranteed to find  a  good approximation.  We then discuss an on-line learning algorithm, based on the  \"Hedge\" algorithm,  for  finding  a good linear combination of ranking \"experts.\"  We use the ordering algorithm combined with the on-line learning algorithm to  find a combination of \"search experts,\" each of which is a domain-specific query  expansion strategy for a WWW search engine,  and present experimental  results  that demonstrate the merits of our approach.",

Whether this is a good idea  or not depends on the robustness with respect to deviations from  the postulated  model.  We  study this question experimentally in a restricted, yet non-trivial and  interesting case:  we consider a conditionally independent attribute (CIA) model  which  postulates  a  single  binary-valued hidden variable z  on  which all other  attributes (i.e., the target and the observables) depend. In this model, finding the  most likely value of anyone variable (given known values for the others) reduces  to testing a linear function of the observed values.",

Correlations between  features  can  arise  when the speech signal is non-stationary or corrupted by  noise.  We  investigate  how  to  model  these  correlations  using  factor  analysis,  a  statistical method for  dimensionality reduction .  Factor  analysis  uses  a  small number of parameters to model  the  covariance struc(cid:173) ture  of  high  dimensional  data.  These  parameters  are  estimated  by  an  Expectation-Maximization (EM)  algorithm that can  be  em(cid:173) bedded  in  the  training  procedures  for  HMMs.  We  evaluate  the  combined  use  of  mixture  densities  and  factor  analysis  in  HMMs  that  recognize  alphanumeric strings.  Holding the  total  number of  parameters fixed,  we  find  that  these  methods, properly  combined,  yield  better models than either  method on its own.",

We  apply  this  model  to  review  movies,  a  stimulus  sequence  that replicates  the stimulation a  cell  receives  during free  viewing  of natural  images.  Data  were  collected  from  three  cells  using five  different  review movies, and the model was fit  separately  to  the data from  each  movie.  For  the  energy  mechanism alone  we  find  modest  but  significant  correlations  (rE  =  0.41,  0.43,  0.59,  0.35)  between  model  and  data.  These  correlations  are  improved  somewhat when we  allow for suppressive surround effects  (rE+G  =  0.42,  0.56,  0.60,  0.37).  In  one  case  the  inclusion  of a  delayed  suppressive  surround dramatically improves the  fit  to the  data by  modifying the  time course  of the model's response.",

We analyze an invariant metric that has performed  well for the latter - the tangent distance - and study its limitations when  applied to regular images, showing that the most significant among these  (convergence to local minima) can be drastically reduced by computing  the distance in a multiresolution setting. This leads to the multi resolution  tangent distance,  which exhibits  significantly  higher invariance  to  im(cid:173) age transformations, and can be easily combined with robust estimation  procedures.",

        "abstract": "A novel neural network model of pre-attention processing in visual(cid:173) search  tasks  is  presented.  Using displays of line orientations taken  from  Wolfe's experiments  [1992], we  study the  hypothesis  that the  distinction  between  parallel  versus  serial  processes  arises  from  the  availability of global information in  the internal representations  of  the  visual  scene.  The  model  operates  in  two  phases.  First,  the  visual  displays  are  compressed  via  principal-component-analysis.  Second,  the compressed data is processed by a target detector mod(cid:173) ule in order to identify the existence of a  target in the display.  Our  main  finding  is  that  targets  in  displays  which  were  found  exper(cid:173) imentally  to  be  processed  in  parallel can  be  detected  by  the  sys(cid:173) tem,  while  targets  in  experimentally-serial  displays  cannot .  This  fundamental  difference  is  explained  via  variance  analysis  of  the  compressed representations,  providing a  numerical criterion distin(cid:173) guishing parallel from serial displays.  Our model yields a  mapping  of response-time slopes that is similar to Duncan and Humphreys's  \"search  surface\"  [1989],  providing  an  explicit  formulation  of their  intuitive  notion  of feature  similarity.  It presents  a  neural  realiza(cid:173) tion of the  processing that may underlie the classical metaphorical  explanations of visual search.",

We  present  a  novel  application of Bayesian  techniques to Radial Basis Function  networks  by  developing a  Gaussian approximation to the posterior  distribution  which,  for  fixed  basis  function  widths,  is  analytic  in  the  parameters.  The setting of regularization  constants  by  cross(cid:173) validation is  wasteful  as  only  a  single optimal  parameter estimate  is  retained.

Herein, we extend that work to show that a  RNN can learn a harder CFL, a simple palindrome, by organizing its re(cid:173) sources into a symbol-sensitive counting solution, and we provide a dy(cid:173) namical systems analysis which demonstrates how the network: can  not  only count, but also copy and store counting infonnation.",

We constructed a model of  a spiking neuron that combines probabilistic firing with a refractory period.  For realistic refractoriness, the model closely reproduced both the average  firing rate and the response precision of a retinal ganglion cell. The model is  based on a \"free\" firing rate, which exists in the absence of refractoriness.  This function may be a better description of a spiking neuron's response  than the peri-stimulus time histogram.",

        "abstract": "In this paper,  we  discuss regularisation in online/sequential learn(cid:173) ing  algorithms.  In environments  where  data  arrives  sequentially,  techniques  such  as  cross-validation  to  achieve  regularisation  or  model  selection  are  not  possible.  Further,  bootstrapping  to  de(cid:173) termine  a  confidence  level  is  not  practical.  To  surmount  these  problems, a minimum variance estimation approach that makes use  of the extended Kalman algorithm for  training multi-layer percep(cid:173) trons is employed.  The novel contribution of this paper is  to show  the  theoretical links  between  extended  Kalman filtering,  Sutton's  variable  learning  rate  algorithms  and  Mackay's  Bayesian  estima(cid:173) tion  framework.  In  doing  so,  we  propose  algorithms to overcome  the  need  for  heuristic  choices  of  the  initial  conditions  and  noise  covariance matrices in  the Kalman approach.",

        "abstract": "A  simple  linear  averaging  of the  outputs  of several  networks  as  e.g.  in  bagging  [3],  seems  to follow  naturally from  a  bias/variance  decomposition of the sum-squared error.  The sum-squared error of  the  average model  is  a  quadratic function  of the weighting factors  assigned to the networks in the ensemble [7], suggesting a quadratic  programming algorithm for finding the \"optimal\" weighting factors.  If we  interpret  the output of a  network as a probability statement,  the  sum-squared  error  corresponds  to  minus  the  loglikelihood  or  the  Kullback-Leibler  divergence,  and  linear  averaging  of the  out(cid:173) puts  to  logarithmic  averaging  of the  probability  statements:  the  logarithmic opinion pool.  The crux of this  paper  is  that this whole  story  about model aver(cid:173) aging,  bias/variance decompositions,  and  quadratic  programming  to find  the  optimal weighting  factors,  is  not specific  for  the sum(cid:173) squared error,  but applies to the combination of probability state(cid:173) ments  of any  kind  in  a  logarithmic opinion  pool,  as  long  as  the  Kullback-Leibler divergence plays the role of the error measure.  As  examples we  treat model averaging for  classification  models under  a cross-entropy error measure and models for estimating variances.",

        "abstract": "Scale  invariance  is  a  fundamental  property  of ensembles  of  nat(cid:173) ural  images  [1].  Their  non  Gaussian  properties  [15,  16]  are  less  well  understood,  but  they  indicate  the  existence  of  a  rich  statis(cid:173) tical  structure.  In  this  work  we  present  a  detailed  study  of the  marginal statistics of a  variable related to the edges in the images.  A numerical analysis shows that it exhibits extended self-similarity  [3,  4,  5].  This  is  a  scaling  property  stronger  than  self-similarity:  all its moments can be expressed as  a power of any given moment.  More  interesting,  all  the  exponents  can  be  predicted  in  terms  of  a  multiplicative  log-Poisson process.  This  is  the very  same model  that  was  used  very  recently  to  predict  the  correct  exponents  of  the structure functions  of turbulent flows  [6].  These  results  allow  us to study the underlying multifractal singularities.  In  particular  we  find  that the most singular structures are one-dimensional:  the  most singular manifold  consists of sharp edges.",

As possible candidates, we derive local versions of factor analysis  regression, principle component regression, principle component regression  on joint distributions, and partial least squares regression.

One  surprising  outcome  is  that  locally  weighted  partial  least  squares  regression offers the best average results,  thus outperforming even  factor analysis, the theoretically most appealing of our candidate techniques.",

This  circuit  uses  only six  transis(cid:173) tors and two capacitors.  It is operated in the subthreshold domain.  The circuit maintains a  high transient gain by using adaptation to  the  background intensity  as  a  form  of gain  control.  The  adapta(cid:173) tion time  constant of the circuit  can be  controlled via an external  bias.  Its temporal filtering  properties change with the background  intensity or  signal-to-noise conditions.  The frequency  response  of  the  circuit  shows  that in  the  frequency  range  of 1 to  100  Hz,  the  circuit response goes from  highpass filtering under high light levels  to lowpass filtering  under low  light levels  (Le.,  when  the signal-to(cid:173) noise  ratio is  low).

We derive c1osed-fonn expressions for the lower-bounds on  the capacity of a simple model of a cortical synapse under two explicit  coding paradigms.  Under the \"signal estimation\" paradigm, we assume  the signal to be encoded in the mean firing rate of a Poisson neuron.  The  perfonnance of an optimal linear estimator of the  signal  then  provides  a lower bound on the  capacity for signal estimation.  Under the  \"signal  detection\" paradigm, the presence or absence of the signal has to be de(cid:173) tected.  Perfonnance of the optimal spike detector allows us to compute  a lower bound on the capacity for signal detection.

Here we present a specific higher order cortical model of  attentional networks, rhythmic expectancy, and the interaction of hi~her\u00ad order and primar\u00a5, cortical levels of processing. It accounts for the' mis(cid:173) match negativity' of the auditory ERP and the results of psychological  experiments of Jones showing that auditory stream  segregation depends  on the rhythmic structure of inputs. The timing mechanisms of the model  allow  us to explain how relative timing information such as the relative  order of events between  streams is  lost when streams are  formed.  The  model suggests how the theories of auditory perception and attention of  Jones and Bregman may be reconciled.",

        "abstract": "There is  strong  evidence that face  processing is  localized in  the brain.  The  double  dissociation  between  prosopagnosia,  a  face  recognition  deficit occurring after brain damage, and visual object agnosia, difficulty  recognizing otber kinds of complex objects, indicates tbat face and non(cid:173) face  object recognition may be served by partially independent mecha(cid:173) nisms in the brain.  Is neural specialization innate or learned?  We sug(cid:173) gest  that this  specialization  could be tbe result  of a competitive learn(cid:173) ing mechanism that, during development, devotes neural resources to the  tasks they are best at performing. Furtber, we suggest that the specializa(cid:173) tion arises as an interaction between task requirements and developmen(cid:173) tal  constraints.  In  this paper,  we present a feed-forward computational  model  of visual processing, in which  two  modules compete to  classify  input stimuli.  When  one module receives low  spatial  frequency infor(cid:173) mation  and  the  other  receives high  spatial  frequency  information,  and  the task is to identify the faces while simply classifying the objects, the  low frequency network shows a strong specialization for faces.  No otber  combination  of tasks  and  inputs  shows  this  strong  specialization.  We  take these results as support for  the idea that an  innately-specified face  processing module is unnecessary.",

We have discovered a new scheme to represent the  Fisher information matrix of a stochastic multi-layer perceptron.  Based on this scheme, we have designed an algorithm to compute  the natural gradient. When the input dimension n is much larger  than the number of hidden neurons, the complexity of this algo(cid:173) rithm is of order O(n). It is confirmed by simulations that the  natural gradient descent learning rule is not only efficient but also  robust.",

        "abstract": "Converging  evidence  has  shown  that  human  object  recognition  depends  on  familiarity  with  the  images  of  an  object.  Further,  the  greater  the  similarity  between  objects,  the  stronger  is  the  dependence  on  object  appearance,  and  the  more  important  two(cid:173) dimensional (2D) image information becomes.  These findings,  how(cid:173) ever, do not rule out the use of 3D structural information in recog(cid:173) nition,  and  the  degree  to  which  3D  information  is  used  in  visual  memory is an important issue.  Liu, Knill, & Kersten (1995) showed  that  any model  that  is  restricted  to  rotations  in  the  image  plane  of independent  2D  templates  could not  account for  human perfor(cid:173) mance in discriminating novel object views.  We now present results  from models of generalized radial basis functions  (GRBF), 2D near(cid:173) est  neighbor  matching that  allows  2D  affine  transformations,  and  a Bayesian statistical estimator that integrates over all possible 2D  affine  transformations.  The  performance  of the  human  observers  relative  to  each  of  the  models  is  better for  the  novel  views  than  for  the familiar  template views,  suggesting that humans generalize  better to novel  views  from  template views.  The  Bayesian estima(cid:173) tor yields the optimal performance with  2D  affine  transformations  and  independent  2D  templates.  Therefore,  models  of  2D  affine  matching  operations  with  independent  2D  templates  are unlikely  to account for  human recognition performance.",

A recently proposed  and very promising boosting algorithm is AdaBoost [5].  It has been ap(cid:173) plied with great success to several benchmark machine learning problems  using rather simple learning algorithms [4],  and decision trees [1,  2,  6].  In  this  paper we use AdaBoost to  improve the performances of neural  networks.  We compare training methods based on sampling the training  set and  weighting the cost function.  Our system  achieves  about  1.4%  error on  a  data base  of online handwritten  digits  from  more  than  200  writers.  Adaptive boosting of a multi-layer network achieved 1.5% error  on the UCI Letters and 8.1 % error on the UCI satellite data set.",

This paper presents a method for ascertaining the relevance  of inputs  by  exploiting  temporal  coherence  and  predictability.  The  method  pro(cid:173) posed in this paper dynamically allocates relevance to inputs by using expectations  of their  future  values.  As  a  model  of the  task  is  learned,  the  model  is  simulta(cid:173) neously extended to create task-specific predictions of the future values of inputs.  Inputs which are either not relevant, and therefore not accounted for in the model,  or those which contain noise, will not be predicted accurately. These inputs can be  de-emphasized, and, in turn, a new, improved, model of the task created. The tech(cid:173) niques  presented  in  this  paper  have  yielded  significant  improvements  for  the  vision-based  autonomous control of a land vehicle,  vision-based hand tracking in  cluttered scenes, and the detection of faults in the etching of semiconductor wafers.",

We present an  algorithm for automated discovery of stochastic firing patterns in  large ensembles of neurons. The algorithm, from the \"Helmholtz  Machine\" family, attempts to predict the observed spike patterns in  the data. The model consists of an observable layer which is directly  activated by the input spike patterns, and hidden units that are ac(cid:173) tivated through ascending connections from the input layer. The  hidden unit activity can be propagated down to the observable layer  to create a prediction of the data pattern that produced it. Hidden  units are added incrementally and their weights are adjusted to im(cid:173) prove the fit between the predictions and data, that is, to increase a  bound on the probability of the data given the model. This greedy  strategy is not globally optimal but is computationally tractable for  large populations of neurons. We show benchmark data on artifi(cid:173) cially constructed spike trains and promising early results on neuro(cid:173) physiological data collected from our chronic multi-electrode cortical  implant.",
