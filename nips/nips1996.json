The model predicted  the existence  of  view-tuned  and view-invariant units,  that were  later found  by  Lo(cid:173) gothetis  et  al.  (Logothetis  et  al.,  1995)  in  IT  cortex  of monkeys  trained  with views  of specific  paperclip  objects.  The model,  how(cid:173) ever,  does  not specify  the inputs to the view-tuned  units and their  internal  organization.  In  this  paper  we  propose  a  model of these  view-tuned  units  that  is  consistent  with  physiological  data from  single cell  responses.",

The  basis for  the  algorithm is  that  the  output of a neural network is characteristic of the input, even when  the  output  is  incorrect.  We  exploit  this  characteristic  output  by  using  an  Output  Adaptation  Module  (OAM)  which  maps this out(cid:173) put  into  the  correct  user-dependent  confidence  vector.  The  OAM  is  a  simplified  Resource  Allocating  Network  which  constructs  ra(cid:173) dial  basis  functions  on-line.  We  applied  the  OAM  to  construct  a  writer-adaptive  character  recognition  system  for  on-line  hand(cid:173) printed  characters.  The  OAM  decreases  the  word  error  rate  on  a  test  set  by  an  average  of 45%,  while  creating  only  3  to  25  basis  functions for  each  writer  in  the  test  set.",

This situation  arises,  e.g., for  medical images,  where  although  training  features  may  be  plentiful,  expensive  expertise  is  re(cid:173) quired  to  extract  their  class  labels.  We  propose  a  classifier  structure  and learning  algorithm  that make effective  use of unlabelled data to im(cid:173) prove performance.  The learning  is  based  on  maximization  of the  total  data  likelihood,  i.e.  over  both  the  labelled  and  unlabelled  data  sub(cid:173) sets.  Two distinct EM learning  algorithms  are proposed,  differing  in  the  EM  formalism  applied  for  unlabelled  data.  The classifier,  based  on  a  joint probability model for features  and labels,  is  a  \"mixture of experts\"  structure that is  equivalent to the  radial  basis function  (RBF) classifier,  but unlike RBFs, is  amenable  to likelihood-based training.  The scope of  application  for  the  new  method  is  greatly  extended  by  the  observation  that test data, or any new data to classify, is in fact  additional,  unlabelled  data - thus,  a combined learning/classification operation - much akin  to  what  is  done  in  image  segmentation  - can  be  invoked  whenever  there  is  new  data to classify.  Experiments  with  data sets from  the  UC  Irvine  database  demonstrate  that  the  new  learning  algorithms  and  structure  achieve substantial performance  gains  over alternative  approaches.",

Numerous  experi(cid:173) ments in primary visual cortex (VI)  have revealed strongly nonlin(cid:173) ear interactions between stimulus elements which activate classical  and  non-classical  receptive  field  regions.  Recurrent  cortical  con(cid:173) nections  likely  contribute  substantially  to  these  effects.  However,  most  theories  of visual  processing  have  either  assumed  a  feedfor(cid:173) ward  processing  scheme  [7],  or have used  recurrent  interactions  to  account  for  isolated  effects  only  [1,  16,  18].  Since  nonlinear  sys(cid:173) tems  cannot  in  general  be  taken  apart  and  analyzed  in  pieces,  it  is  not  clear  what  one  learns  by  building  a  recurrent  model  that  only  accounts  for  one,  or  very  few  phenomena.  Here  we  develop  a  relatively simple model of recurrent  interactions  in  VI,  that  re(cid:173) flects  major anatomical and  physiological features  of intracortical  connectivity,  and  simultaneously accounts for  a  wide range of phe(cid:173) nomena observed  physiologically.

        "abstract": "This paper presents a new approach to speech recognition with hybrid  HMM/ANN  technology.  While  the  standard  approach  to  hybrid  HMMI ANN  systems  is  based  on  the  use  of  neural  networks  as  posterior probability estimators, the new approach is based on the use  of mutual information neural  networks trained with a special learning  algorithm  in  order to  maximize the  mutual  information  between  the  input classes of the network and its resulting sequence of firing output  neurons  during  training.  It is  shown  in  this  paper that  such  a  neural  network  is  an  optimal  neural  vector quantizer for  a  discrete  hidden  Markov  model  system  trained  on  Maximum  Likelihood  principles.  One  of the  main  advantages  of this  approach  is  the  fact,  that  such  neural  networks  can  be  easily  combined  with  HMM's  of  any  complexity  with context-dependent capabilities.  It is  shown  that  the  resulting  hybrid  system  achieves  very  high  recognition  rates,  which  are  now  already  on  the  same  level  as  the  best  conventional  HMM  systems  with  continuous  parameters,  and  the  capabilities  of  the  mutual information neural networks are not yet entirely exploited.",

Biological  systems,  however,  use  action  potentials,  which  are  digital-amplitude  events  that  encode  analog  information  in  the  inter-event  interval.  Action-potential  representations are now  being used  to advantage in neuromorphic  VLSI  systems as  well.  We  report on a  simple learning rule,  based  on  the  Riccati  equation  described  by  Kohonen  [1],  modified  for  action-potential  neuronal  outputs.  We  demonstrate  this  learning  rule in an analog VLSI chip that uses volatile capacitive storage for  synaptic weights.  We  show that our time-dependent learning rule  is  sufficient  to achieve  approximate weight  normalization and  can  detect temporal correlations in spike trains.",

The method uses samples of QoS  results at dif(cid:173) ferent load conditions to build a neural  network decision function.  Pre(cid:173) vious  similar approaches  to  the  problem  have  a  significant  bias.  This  bias is likely to  occur in any real system and results in accepting loads  that miss QoS targets by orders of magnitude. Preprocessing the data to  either remove  the  bias  or provide  a  confidence  level,  the  method  was  applied  to  sources  based  on  difficult-to-analyze  ethernet  data  traces.  With this data, the method produces an accurate access control function  that  dramatically  outperforms  analytic  alternatives.  Interestingly,  the  results depend on throwing away more than 99% of the data.",

The constructive  algorithm pro(cid:173) posed  here  enables  large  hierarchies  consisting  of several  hundred  experts  to be  trained effectively.  We  show  that HME's  trained  by  our  automatic  growing  procedure  yield  better  generalization  per(cid:173) formance  than  traditional  static  and  balanced  hierarchies.  Eval(cid:173) uation  of  the  algorithm  is  performed  (1)  on  vowel  classification  and  (2)  within  a  hybrid  version  of the  JANUS  r9]  speech  recog(cid:173) nition system  using a  subset  of the Switchboard large-vocabulary  speaker-independent  continuous speech  recognition database.",

The  algo(cid:173) rithm we  analyze performs on-line updating of a  parameter vector  during a  single endless  trajectory of an aperiodic irreducible finite  state Markov chain.  Results include convergence (with probability  1),  a  characterization of the limit  of convergence,  and a  bound on  the resulting approximation error.  In addition to establishing new  and  stronger  results  than  those  previously  available,  our  analysis  is  based  on  a  new  line  of  reasoning  that  provides  new  intuition  about the dynamics of temporal-difference learning.  Furthermore,  we  discuss  the  implications  of two  counter-examples with  regards  to the Significance  of on-line updating and linearly  parameterized  function  approximators.",

Therefore,  a  reliable  neu(cid:173) ral  coding  scheme,  whether  a  rate  coding  or  a  spike  time  based  coding,  must  be  robust  in  a  dynamic  neuromodulatory  environ(cid:173) ment.  The common observation that cholinergic modulation leads  to  a  reduction  in  spike  frequency  adaptation  implies  a  modifica(cid:173) tion  of spike  timing,  which  would  make  a  neural  code  based  on  precise spike timing difficult to maintain.  In this paper, the effects  of cholinergic modulation were  studied to test  the hypothesis that  precise  spike timing can serve  as a  reliable neural code.  Using  the  whole  cell  patch-clamp technique  in rat neocortical  slice  prepara(cid:173) tion and compartmental modeling techniques,  we show that cholin(cid:173) ergic  modulation, surprisingly,  preserved  spike  timing in response  to a fluctuating  inputs that resembles  in  vivo conditions.  This re(cid:173) sult suggests that in vivo spike timing may be much more resistant  to changes in neuromodulator concentrations than previous physi(cid:173) ological studies have  implied.",

Committee perfonnance decreases with both the average error of  the constituent classifiers and increases  with  the degree to  which the  misclassifications are correlated across the committee.  Here, a method  for  reducing  correlations  is  introduced,  that  uses  a  winner-take-all  procedure  similar  to  competitive  learning  to  drive  the  individual  networks  to  different  minima  in  weight  space  with  respect  to  the  training set, such that correlations in  generalization perfonnance will be  reduced, thereby reducing committee error.",

We propose a composi(cid:173) tional model in which  primitives are recursively composed, subject  to syntactic restrictions, to form tree-structured objects and object  groupings.

Ac(cid:173) cording  to our  EM  approach  the  adjustment  of spline  parameters  draws  on  an  iterative  weighted  least-squares  fitting  process.  The  expectation  step  of our  EM  procedure  computes  the  likelihood  of  the data using a mixture model defined over the set of spline cover(cid:173) ings.  These splines  are limited in  their  spatial extent  using  Gaus(cid:173) sian windowing functions.  The maximisation of the likelihood leads  to a set of linear equations in the spline parameters which solve the  weighted least squares problem.  We  evaluate the technique  on  the  localisation of road structures in  aerial infra-red images.",

We  show  here  that non-linear  'infomax',  when  applied  to  an ensemble  of nat(cid:173) ural  scenes,  produces  sets of visual  filters  that are localised  and oriented.  Some  of these  filters  are  Gabor-like  and  resemble  those  produced  by  the  sparseness-maximisation network of Olshausen & Field (1996).  In addition,  the outputs  of these filters  are as  independent  as  possible,  since  the info(cid:173) max network is  able to perform Independent Components Analysis  (ICA).  We  compare the resulting ICA filters  and their associated basis  functions,  with other decorrelating filters produced by Principal Components Analysis  (PCA)  and zero-phase whitening filters  (ZCA).  The ICA filters  have more  sparsely distributed (kurtotic) outputs on natural scenes.  They also resem(cid:173) ble the receptive fields  of simple  cells  in  visual  cortex,  which  suggests that  these neurons form an information-theoretic co-ordinate system for images.",

Unfortunately,  standard techniques break down  when  faced with models, such as neural networks,  in which there is more than one  \"layer\" of adjustable parameters.  We propose an algorithm which overcomes  this limitation,  estimating the equivalent kernels for  neural network models  using  a  data  perturbation approach.  Experimental  results  indicate  that  the  networks do  not  use  the  maximum possible  number of degrees of freedom,  that  these  can  be  controlled  using  regularisation  techniques  and  that  the  equivalent kernels learnt by the network vary both  in \"size\"  and in \"shape\"  in different regions of the input space.",

This  paper  addresses  the  case  where the system must be prevented from having catastrophic failures dur(cid:173) ing learning.  We  propose  a  new  algorithm adapted  from  the  dual  control  literature  and  use  Bayesian  locally  weighted  regression  models  with  dy(cid:173) namic programming.  A common reinforcement learning assumption is that  aggressive exploration should be encouraged.

The  main  disad(cid:173) vantage of OBS  is  its high complexity.  OBS needs  to calculate the  inverse  Hessian  to delete only one  weight  (thus  needing  much time  to  prune  a  big  net) .  A  better  algorithm should  use  this matrix to  remove more than only one  weight , because  calculating the inverse  Hessian  takes  the  most time in  the  OBS  algorithm.  The  algorithm,  called  Unit- OBS,  described  in  this  article  is  a  method to overcome this disadvantage.  This algorithm only  needs  to calculate the inverse Hessian once to remove one whole unit thus  drastically  reducing  the  time to prune big nets.  A  further  advantage  of Unit- OBS  is  that  it  can  be  used  to  do  a  feature  extraction  on  the  input  data.  This  can  be  helpful  on  the  understanding of unknown  problems.",

        "abstract": "This paper shows that if a large neural network is used for a pattern  classification  problem, and the learning algorithm finds  a  network  with  small  weights  that  has  small  squared  error  on  the  training  patterns,  then  the generalization performance depends  on the size  of the  weights  rather  than  the  number  of weights.  More  specifi(cid:173) cally,  consider  an i-layer feed-forward  network of sigmoid units, in  which  the  sum  of the  magnitudes  of the  weights  associated  with  each  unit is  bounded  by  A.  The  misclassification probability con(cid:173) verges  to an error estimate (that is closely  related to squared error  on  the  training  set)  at  rate  O((cA)l(l+1)/2J(log n)jm)  ignoring  log  factors,  where  m  is  the  number of training  patterns,  n  is  the  input  dimension,  and  c is  a  constant.  This may explain  the  gen(cid:173) eralization performance of neural  networks,  particularly when  the  number of training examples is considerably smaller than the num(cid:173) ber  of weights.  It also  supports  heuristics  (such  as  weight  decay  and early stopping)  that attempt to keep  the weights small during  training.",

Our approach overcomes the limitations of the SOM, while  introducing no significant disadvantages.

When  the  information  content  exceeds  a  certain  value,  the  rule  will  automatically  begin  to  learn  a  feature in the input.  Our analysis suggests that under certain conditions  it  is  the  first  principal  component  that  is  learned.  The  weight  vector  length  remains  bounded,  provided  the  variance  of  the  input  is  finite.  Simulations confirm the theoretical results derived.",

Kriging is an interpolation  method which uses a global covariation model estimated from the data  to take account of the spatial dependence in the data. Based on the  close relationship between kriging and the radial basis function (RBF)  network (Wan & Bone, 1996), we use a mixture of generalized RBF  networks to partition the input space into statistically correlated  regions and learn the local covariation model of the data in each  region. Applying the ME approach to simulated and real-world data,  we show that it is able to achieve good partitioning of the input space,  learn the local covariation models and improve generalization.",

In  particular our architecture is  non-iterative in  the sense of Marr [5]:  at every  time step,  the  local estimates  at  a  given  location are  op(cid:173) timal given the information which  has already been  propagated to  that  location.

        "abstract": "This paper develops arguments for a family of temporal  log-linear models  to  represent spatio-temporal correlations  among  the  spiking  events  in  a  group of neurons.  The models can represent not just pairwise  correlations  but also correlations of higher order.  Methods  are discussed  for  inferring  the existence or absence of correlations and estimating their strength.  A  frequentist  and  a  Bayesian  approach  to  correlation  detection  are  compared.  The frequentist method is based on G 2 statistic with estimates  obtained via the  Max-Ent  principle.  In  the  Bayesian  approach  a  Markov  Chain  Monte  Carlo  Model  Composition  (MC3)  algorithm  is  applied  to  search  over  connectivity  structures  and  Laplace's  method  is  used  to  approximate their posterior probability.  Performance  of the  methods  was  tested on synthetic data.  The  methods  were  applied  to  experimental  data  obtained  by  the  fourth  author by  means  of measurements  carried  out  on  behaving Rhesus monkeys at the Hadassah Medical School  of the  Hebrew  University.  As  conjectured,  neural  connectivity  structures  need  not  be  neither hierarchical nor decomposable.",

        "abstract": "By  now  it is  widely  accepted  that learning  a  task  from  scratch,  i.e.,  without  any prior knowledge,  is a daunting  undertaking. Humans,  however,  rarely at(cid:173) tempt  to  learn  from  scratch.  They  extract  initial  biases  as  well  as  strategies  how  to  approach a learning problem from  instructions and/or demonstrations  of other  humans.  For  learning  control,  this  paper  investigates  how  learning  from  demonstration  can  be  applied  in  the  context of reinforcement  learning.  We  consider priming  the  Q-function,  the  value  function,  the  policy,  and  the  model of the task dynamics as possible areas where demonstrations can speed  up  learning.  In  general  nonlinear learning  problems,  only  model-based  rein(cid:173) forcement learning shows significant speed-up after a demonstration,  while in  the  special  case  of linear  quadratic  regulator  (LQR)  problems,  all  methods  profit  from  the  demonstration.  In  an  implementation  of pole  balancing  on  a  complex  anthropomorphic  robot  arm,  we  demonstrate  that,  when  facing  the  complexities  of real  signal  processing,  model-based  reinforcement  learning  offers  the  most robustness for LQR problems. Using  the suggested methods,  the  robot  learns  pole  balancing  in  just a  single trial  after  a  30  second  long  demonstration of the human instructor.",

This  paper  proposes  an  approximate  approach  in  which bandit processes are used to model, in a certain \"local\" sense,  a given MDP. Bandit processes constitute an important subclass of  MDP's,  and  have  optimal learning  strategies  (defined  in  terms  of  Gittins indices)  that can be  computed relatively  efficiently.  Thus,  one  scheme  for  achieving  approximately-optimal learning  for  gen(cid:173) eral MDP's proceeds by taking actions suggested by strategies that  are  optimal with respect  to local  bandit  models.",

For  example, experience may tell us  that certain parameters are closely  related  and  should  not  be  explored  independently.  Similarly, ex(cid:173) perience  may establish  that  a  subset  of parameters must  take  on  particular  values.  Any  search  of the  cost  landscape  should  take  advantage of these relationships.  We  present  MIMIC,  a framework  in which  we  analyze the global structure of the optimization land(cid:173) scape.  A  novel  and  efficient  algorithm for  the  estimation of this  structure is  derived.  We  use  knowledge of this structure to guide a  randomized search  through the solution space  and,  in  turn,  to re(cid:173) fine our estimate ofthe structure.  Our technique obtains significant  speed  gains over  other randomized optimization procedures.",

        "abstract": "Dynamic  Programming,  Q-Iearning  and  other  discrete  Markov  Decision  Process  solvers  can be -applied to continuous d-dimensional state-spaces  by  quantizing the state space into an array of boxes.  This is often problematic  above  two dimensions:  a  coarse  quantization can lead  to poor policies, and  fine  quantization is too expensive.  Possible solutions are variable-resolution  discretization,  or function  approximation  by  neural  nets.  A  third option,  which  has  been  little  studied  in  the  reinforcement  learning  literature,  is  interpolation on  a  coarse  grid.  In  this  paper we  study  interpolation tech(cid:173) niques  that  can  result  in  vast  improvements in  the  online  behavior of the  resulting  control  systems:  multilinear  interpolation,  and  an  interpolation  algorithm  based  on  an  interesting  regular  triangulation  of d-dimensional  space.  We  adapt  these  interpolators  under  three  reinforcement  learning  paradigms:  (i)  offline value iteration with  a  known  model,  (ii)  Q-Iearning,  and  (iii)  online  value  iteration  with  a  previously  unknown  model  learned  from data.  We  describe empirical results,  and the resulting implications for  practical learning of continuous non-linear dynamic control.",

The  natural  Riemannian  gradient  should  be  used  instead of the  conventional gradient, since  the former  denotes  the  true steepest descent direction of a loss function in the Riemannian  space.  The behavior of the  stochastic gradient learning  algorithm  is  much more effective if the natural gradient is  used.  The present  paper studies the information-geometrical structure of perceptrons  and  other  networks,  and  prove  that  the  on-line  learning  method  based  on  the  natural  gradient  is  asymptotically  as  efficient  as  the  optimal  batch  algorithm.  Adaptive  modification  of the  learning  constant is proposed and analyzed in terms of the Riemannian mea(cid:173) sure  and  is  shown  to  be  efficient.

In  the  Monte-Carlo  sim(cid:173) ulation,  the  long-term expected  reward  of each  possible  action  is  statistically measured, using the initial policy to make decisions  in  each  step of the simulation.  The action maximizing the  measured  expected reward is then taken, resulting in an improved policy.  Our  algorithm is easily parallelizable and has been implemented on the  IBM  SP! and SP2 parallel-RISC supercomputers.  We  have  obtained  promising  initial  results  in  applying  this  algo(cid:173) rithm  to the  domain of backgammon.  Results  are  reported  for  a  wide  variety  of initial  policies,  ranging  from  a  random  policy  to  TD-Gammon, an extremely strong multi-layer neural  network.  In  each case,  the Monte-Carlo algorithm gives a substantial reduction,  by  as  much as  a  factor  of 5 or  more,  in  the error  rate  of the  base  players.  The  algorithm  is  also  potentially  useful  in  many  other  adaptive control applications in which it is possible to simulate the  environment.",

They revealed  that patch-suppressed cells  when  stimulated  with  contrasting orientations  inside  and  outside  their  cRF  can strongly  respond  to  stimuli  oriented  orthogonal to their  nominal  preferred  orientation.  Here  we  analyze  the  emergence  of  such  complex  response patterns in  a  simple  model  of primary  vi(cid:173) sual  cortex.  We  show that the observed sensitivity for  orientation  contrast  can  be  explained  by  a  delicate  interplay  between  local  isotropic interactions and patchy long-range connectivity between  distant iso-orientation domains.  In particular we demonstrate that  the observed properties might arise without specific connections be(cid:173) tween sites with  cross-oriented cRFs.",

The  confidence  interval  follows  from the variation in an ensemble of neural networks,  each of them  trained and stopped on bootstrap replicates of the original data set.  A second improvement is the use of the residuals on validation pat(cid:173) terns  instead of on training patterns for  estimation of the variance  of the  target  distribution.  As  illustrated  on  a  synthetic  example,  our method is  better than existing methods with regard to extrap(cid:173) olation and interpolation in data regimes with a limited amount of  data, and yields prediction intervals which  actual confidence  levels  are closer  to the desired  confidence  levels.",

This  paper  shows  that the distinction between  inputs  and  outputs is  not this  simple.  Some  features  are  more  useful  as  extra  outputs  than  as  inputs.  By using a feature  as  an output we  get  more than just the  case  values but can. learn a  mapping from  the other inputs to that  feature.  For many features  this mapping may be more useful  than  the  feature  value  itself.  We  present  two  regression  problems  and  one  classification problem  where  performance improves  if features  that  could  have  been  used  as  inputs  are  used  as  extra  outputs  instead.  This result is  surprising since  a feature used  as  an output  is  not  used  during testing.",

Our approach differs from the previous complexity regularization neural network function learning schemes in that we operate with random covering numbers and 11 metric entropy, making it po~sibleto consider much broader families of activa(cid:173) tion functions, namely functions of bounded variation. Some constraints previously imposed on the network parameters are also eliminated this way. The network is trained by means of complexity regularization in(cid:173) volving empirical risk minimization. Bounds on the expected risk in tenns of the sample size are obtained for a large class of loss functions. Rates of convergence to the optimal loss are also derived.",

        "abstract": "Stochastic  (on-line)  learning  can  be  faster  than  batch  learning.  However,  at late times,  the learning rate must be annealed to re(cid:173) move  the noise  present  in  the stochastic weight  updates.  In  this  annealing phase,  the convergence rate (in  mean square)  is  at best  proportional to  l/T where T  is  the number of input presentations.  An alternative is  to increase the batch size to remove the noise.  In  this paper we explore convergence for LMS using 1)  small but fixed  batch sizes  and  2)  an adaptive batch size.  We  show  that the best  adaptive  batch schedule  is  exponential  and  has  a  rate  of  conver(cid:173) gence which is  the same as for  annealing, Le.,  at best proportional  to  l/T.",

We  have devel(cid:173) oped a  network model of disparity estimation based on disparity(cid:173) selective neurons, such as those found in the early stages of process(cid:173) ing  in  visual cortex.  The model  can accurately estimate multiple  disparities in a region, which may be caused by transparency or oc(cid:173) clusion,  in real images and random-dot stereograms.  The use of a  selection mechanism to selectively integrate reliable local disparity  estimates  results  in  superior  performance  compared  to  standard  back-propagation  and  cross-correlation  approaches.  In  addition,  the representations learned with this selection mechanism are con(cid:173) sistent  with  recent  neurophysiological  results  of  von  der  Heydt,  Zhou, Friedman, and Poggio [8]  for cells in cortical visual area V2.

First,  two novel algorithms for self-organization are derived from  a two-layer  linear hetero-associative network performing a one-of-m classification,  and trained with the constrained least-mean-squared classification error  criterion.  Second, two adaptive algorithms are derived from  these self(cid:173) organizing  procedures  the  principal  generalized  eigenvectors  of  two  correlation  matrices  from  two  sequences  of  random  vectors. These novel  adaptive  algorithms can  be  implemented  in  a  single-layer  linear  feed-forward  network.  We  give  a  rigorous  convergence  analysis  of the  adaptive  algorithms  by  using  stochastic  approximation theory.

We study the properties of the input sig(cid:173) nal  to  the  visual  cortex  and  find  new  statistical  structures  which  have not been processed in the retino-geniculate pathway.  Applying  the idea that the system optimizes the  representation  of incoming  signals,  we  derive  the  lateral connectivity that will  achieve  this for  a  set  of local orientation-selective patches,  as  well  as  the  complete  spatial structure of a layer of such patches.  We compare the results  with various  physiological measurements.",

        "abstract": "Coarse  codes  are  widely  used  throughout  the  brain to encode  sen(cid:173) sory  and  motor  variables.  Methods  designed  to  interpret  these  codes,  such  as population vector analysis, are either inefficient, i.e.,  the variance of the estimate is much larger than the smallest possi(cid:173) ble  variance,  or biologically implausible, like  maximum likelihood.  Moreover,  these  methods  attempt  to  compute  a  scalar  or  vector  estimate  of the  encoded  variable.  Neurons  are  faced  with  a  simi(cid:173) lar  estimation problem .  They  must  read  out  the  responses  of the  presynaptic  neurons,  but,  by  contrast,  they  typically  encode  the  variable  with  a  further  population  code  rather  than  as  a  scalar.  We  show  how  a  non-linear  recurrent  network  can  be  used  to  per(cid:173) form these estimation in an optimal way while keeping the estimate  in  a  coarse  code  format.  This  work  suggests  that  lateral  connec(cid:173) tions  in  the  cortex  may  be  involved  in  cleaning  up  uncorrelated  noise  among neurons  representing  similar variables.",

        "abstract": "In order to process  incoming sounds  efficiently,  it is  advantageous  for the auditory system to be adapted to the statistical structure of  natural auditory scenes.  As a first step in investigating the relation  between  the system  and its inputs,  we  study low-order  statistical  properties in several sound ensembles  using a  filter  bank analysis.  Focusing on the amplitude and phase in different frequency bands,  we  find  simple  parametric  descriptions  for  their  distribution  and  power  spectrum  that  are valid  for  very  different  types  of sounds.  In  particular,  the  amplitude  distribution  has  an  exponential  tail  and  its  power  spectrum  exhibits  a  modified  power-law  behavior,  which is  manifested by self-similarity and long-range temporal cor(cid:173) relations.  Furthermore,  the statistics for  different  bands  within  a  given  ensemble  are  virtually  identical,  suggesting  translation  in(cid:173) variance along the cochlear  axis.  These results  show  that natural  sounds are highly redundant, and have possible implications to the  neural code used  by the auditory system.",

It  is  found  that  correlations severely  may slow  down  learning.  This  explains the success of PCA as a method for reducing training time.  Motivated by this finding  we  furthermore propose to transform the  input  data by  removing the mean across  input variables as  well  as  examples to decrease correlations.

The  task  is  framed  as  an  optimal control  problem  in  which  both  comfort  and  energy  costs  are  considered  as  part of the  con(cid:173) trol  objective.  Because  the  consequences  of control  decisions  are  delayed  in  time, the  N eurothermostat  must  anticipate heating de(cid:173) mands with predictive models of occupancy  patterns and the ther(cid:173) mal response of the house and furnace.  Occupancy  pattern predic(cid:173) tion  is  achieved  by  a  hybrid  neural  net  /  look-up table.  The  Neu(cid:173) rothermostat  searches,  at  each  discrete  time  step,  for  a  decision  sequence  that  minimizes  the  expected  cost  over  a  fixed  planning  horizon.  The first  decision  in this sequence  is  taken,  and  this  pro(cid:173) cess  repeats.  Simulations of the  Neurothermostat  were  conducted  using  artificial  occupancy  data  in  which  regularity  was  systemat(cid:173) ically  varied,  as  well  as  occupancy  data from  an  actual  residence.  The Neurothermostat is  compared against three  conventional poli(cid:173) cies,  and  achieves  reliably  lower  costs.  This result  is  robust  to the  relative  weighting of comfort  and  energy  costs  and  the  degree  of  variability in the occupancy  patterns.",

Here  we  suggest  a  mixture  which  blends  several autoregressive models.  This study focuses  on  some  theoretical foundations  of the  predic(cid:173) tion  problem  in  this  context.  More  precisely,  it  is  demonstrated  that this model is  a  universal approximator,  with  respect to learn(cid:173) ing the  unknown  prediction function .  This statement is  strength(cid:173) ened  as  upper  bounds  on the  mean  squared error are  established.  Based on these results it is  possible to compare the MEM to other  families of models  (e.g.,  neural networks and state dependent mod(cid:173) els).  It is  shown  that  a  degenerate  version  of the  MEM  is  in  fact  equivalent to a  neural  network, and  the  number  of experts  in  the  architecture  plays  a  similar role  to the  number  of hidden  units  in  the latter model.",

We use a  bound on the relative entropy between the two HMMs as a distance mea(cid:173) sure between them.  The result is new iterative training algorithms which  are similar to the EM (Baum-Welch) algorithm for training HMMs.  The  proposed algorithms are  composed  of a  step similar to the expectation  step of Baum-Welch and a new update of the parameters  which replaces  the maximization (re-estimation) step.  The algorithm takes only negligi(cid:173) bly more time per iteration and an  approximated version  uses  the same  expectation  step  as  Baum-Welch.

Our  approach  is  to  embed  the discrete set of permutations in  a  convex continuous domain D.

The information  maximization and minimization are performed on two different lev(cid:173) els:  collective and individual level.  Thus, two kinds  of information:  collective and  individual  information  are  defined.  By  maximizing  collective  information  and  by  minimizing  individual  information,  simple  networks  can  be  generated  in  terms  of the  number  of con(cid:173) nections  and  the  number  of hidden  units.  Obtained  networks  are  expected  to give better generalization and improved interpretation  of internal representations.  This method  was applied  to the infer(cid:173) ence  of the  maximum onset  principle  of an artificial  language.  In  this  problem,  it  was  shown  that  the  individual  information  min(cid:173) imization  is  not  contradictory  to  the  collective  information  max(cid:173) imization.  In  addition,  experimental  results  confirmed  improved  generalization performance,  because over-training can significantly  be suppressed.",

        "abstract": "We  have  explored  two  approaches  to  recogmzmg  faces  across  changes in pose.  First, we developed a representation of face images  based on independent  component analysis  (ICA)  and compared it  to  a  principal  component  analysis  (PCA)  representation for  face  recognition.  The  ICA  basis  vectors  for  this  data set  were  more  spatially local than the PCA basis vectors and the ICA representa(cid:173) tion had greater invariance to changes in pose.  Second, we present  a  model  for  the  development  of  viewpoint  invariant  responses  to  faces  from  visual experience  in a  biological system.  The temporal  continuity  of natural  visual  experience  was  incorporated  into  an  attractor network model  by  Hebbian learning following  a  lowpass  temporal  filter  on  unit  activities.  When  combined  with  the  tem(cid:173) poral filter,  a  basic  Hebbian  update rule  became  a  generalization  of Griniasty  et  al.  (1993),  which  associates  temporally  proximal  input patterns into basins of attraction.  The system acquired rep(cid:173) resentations of faces  that were largely independent of pose.",

We  were  able  to  replicate  some  of the  success  of TD-Gammon,  developing  a  competitive evaluation function on a 4000 parameter feed-forward neu(cid:173) ral network, without using back-propagation, reinforcement or temporal  difference learning methods. Instead we apply simple hill-climbing in  a  relative fitness  environment.  These results and further  analysis  suggest  that the surprising success of Tesauro's program had more to do with the  co-evolutionary  structure of the  learning task and  the  dynamics  of the  backgammon game itself.",
