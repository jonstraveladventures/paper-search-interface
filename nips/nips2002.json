        "abstract": "Recent algorithms for sparse coding and independent component analy- sis (ICA) have demonstrated how localized features can be learned from natural images. However, these approaches do not take image transfor- mations into account. As a result, they produce image codes that are redundant because the same feature is learned at multiple locations. We describe an algorithm for sparse coding based on a bilinear generative model of images. By explicitly modeling the interaction between im- age features and their transformations, the bilinear approach helps reduce redundancy in the image code and provides a basis for transformation- invariant vision. We present results demonstrating bilinear sparse coding of natural images. We also explore an extension of the model that can capture spatial relationships between the independent features of an ob- ject, thereby providing a new framework for parts-based object recogni- tion.",

Model parameters can be \ufb01t on training motifs using a vari- ational EM algorithm within an empirical Bayesian framework. Varia- tional inference is also used for detecting hidden motifs.

We address sparsity and dimensionality reduction by \ufb01rst clustering items based on user access patterns so as to attempt to minimize the apriori probabil- ity that recommendations will cross cluster boundaries and then recom- mending only within clusters. We address the inherent dynamic nature of the problem by explicitly modeling the data as a time series; we show how this representational expressivity \ufb01ts naturally into a maxent frame- work. We conduct experiments on data from ResearchIndex, a popu- lar online repository of over 470,000 computer science documents. We show that our maxent formulation outperforms several competing algo- rithms in of\ufb02ine tests simulating the recommendation of documents to ResearchIndex users.",

The optimal feedback control laws for typical motor tasks obey a \u201cminimal intervention\u201d principle: deviations from the average trajectory are only corrected when they interfere with the task goals. The resulting behavior exhibits task-constrained variabil- ity, as well as synergetic coupling among actuators\u2014which is another unexplained empirical phenomenon.",

        "abstract": "Psychophysical data suggest that temporal modulations of stimulus  amplitude envelopes play a prominent role in the perceptual  segregation of concurrent sounds. In particular, the detection of an  unmodulated signal can be significantly improved by adding  amplitude modulation to the spectral envelope of a competing  masking noise. This perceptual phenomenon  is known as  \u201cComodulation Masking Release\u201d (CMR). Despite the obvious  influence of temporal structure on the perception of complex  auditory scenes, the physiological mechanisms that contribute to  CMR and auditory streaming are not well known. A recent  physiological study by Nelken and colleagues has demonstrated an  enhanced cortical representation of auditory signals in modulated  noise. Our study evaluates these CMR-like response patterns from  the perspective of a hypothetical auditory edge-detection neuron. It  is shown that this simple neural model for the detection of  amplitude transients can reproduce not only the physiological data  of Nelken et al., but also, in light of previous results, a variety of  physiological and psychoacoustical phenomena that are related to  the perceptual segregation of concurrent sounds.",

Previous hardness results indicated that computing good policies from the MDP parameters was dif\ufb01cult, but left open the possibility of succinct function approximation for any \ufb01xed factored MDP.

The main idea is based on exploiting the inherent time structure of sound sources by learning a priori sets of basis \ufb01lters in time domain that encode the sources in a statistically ef\ufb01cient manner. We derive a learning algorithm using a maximum likelihood approach given the observed single channel data and sets of basis \ufb01lters. For each time point we infer the source signals and their contribution factors. This inference is possible due to the prior knowledge of the basis \ufb01lters and the associated coef\ufb01cient densities. A \ufb02exible model for density estimation allows accurate modeling of the observation and our experimental results exhibit a high level of separation performance for mixtures of two music signals as well as the separation of two voice signals.",

The system is composed of a generative probability model and hill-climbing and directed search algo- rithms. By extracting and examining morphologically rich subsets of an input lexicon, the directed search identi\ufb01es highly productive paradigms. The hill-climbing algorithm then further maximizes the probability of the hypothesis. Quantitative results are shown by measuring the accuracy of the morphological relations identi\ufb01ed. Experiments in English and Pol- ish, as well as comparisons with another recent unsupervised morphol- ogy learning algorithm demonstrate the effectiveness of this technique.",

        "abstract": "We present ongoing work on a project for automatic recognition of spon- taneous facial actions. Spontaneous facial expressions differ substan- tially from posed expressions, similar to how continuous, spontaneous speech differs from isolated words produced on command. Previous methods for automatic facial expression recognition assumed images were collected in controlled environments in which the subjects delib- erately faced the camera. Since people often nod or turn their heads, automatic recognition of spontaneous facial behavior requires methods for handling out-of-image-plane head rotations. Here we explore an ap- proach based on 3-D warping of images into canonical views. We eval- uated the performance of the approach as a front-end for a spontaneous expression recognition system using support vector machines and hidden Markov models. This system employed general purpose learning mech- anisms that can be applied to recognition of any facial movement. The system was tested for recognition of a set of facial actions de\ufb01ned by the Facial Action Coding System (FACS). We showed that 3D tracking and warping followed by machine learning techniques directly applied to the warped images, is a viable and promising technology for automatic facial expression recognition. One exciting aspect of the approach pre- sented here is that information about movement dynamics emerged out of \ufb01lters which were derived from the statistics of images.",

We regard the parameters of the classi\ufb01er as latent states in a \ufb01rst order Markov process and propose an algorithm which can be regarded as variational generalization of standard Kalman \ufb01lter- ing. The variational Kalman \ufb01lter is based on two novel lower bounds that enable us to use a non-degenerate distribution over the adaptation rate. An extensive empirical evaluation demonstrates that the proposed method is capable of infering competitive classi\ufb01ers both in stationary and non-stationary environments. Although we focus on classi\ufb01cation, the algorithm is easily extended to other generalized nonlinear models.",

An  ESN  consists  of a  large,  fixed,  recurrent  \"reservoir\"  network, from  which the desired output is  obtained by  training suitable output connection weights.

This  article  reviews  the  basic  ideas  and  de(cid:173) scribes  an  online  adaptation scheme  based  on the  RLS  algorithm  known  from  adaptive  linear  systems.  As  an  example,  a  10-th or(cid:173) der  NARMA  system  is  adaptively identified.  The known  benefits  of the RLS  algorithms carryover from  linear systems to nonlinear  ones;  specifically,  the  convergence rate and  misadjustment  can be  determined at design  time.",

In addition, the mixture model can  perform several tasks such as probability estimation, vector quanti- zation, classification, and clustering.

Rele- vance is measured by scale factors de\ufb01ning the input space metric, and feature selection is performed by assigning zero weights to irrelevant variables. The metric is automatically tuned by the minimization of the standard SVM empirical risk, where scale factors are added to the usual set of parameters de\ufb01ning the classi\ufb01er. Feature selection is achieved by constraints encouraging the sparsity of scale factors. The resulting algorithm compares favorably to state-of-the-art feature selection proce- dures and demonstrates its effectiveness on a demanding facial expres- sion recognition problem.",

The intuitive notion of functional classi\ufb01cation is that cells can be clustered so that most of the diversity is captured by the iden- tity of the clusters rather than by individuals within clusters. We show how this intuition can be made precise using information theory, with- out any need to introduce a metric on the space of stimuli or responses. Applied to the retinal ganglion cells of the salamander, this approach re- covers classical results, but also provides clear evidence for subclasses beyond those identi\ufb01ed previously. Further, we \ufb01nd that each of the gan- glion cells is functionally unique, and that even within the same subclass only a few spikes are needed to reliably distinguish between cells.",

In this paper, we consider the average-cost criterion and a version of approximate linear programming that generates approximations to the optimal average cost and differential cost function. We demonstrate that a naive version of approximate linear programming prioritizes approximation of the optimal average cost and that this may not be well-aligned with the objective of deriving a policy with low average cost. For that, the algorithm should aim at producing a good approximation of the differential cost function. We propose a two- phase variant of approximate linear programming that allows for external control of the relative accuracy of the approximation of the differential cost function over different portions of the state space via state-relevance weights. Performance bounds suggest that the new algorithm is compat- ible with the objective of optimizing performance and provide guidance on appropriate choices for state-relevance weights.",

        "abstract": "We present an automatic alignment procedure which maps the disparate internal representations learned by several local dimensionality reduction experts into a single, coherent global coordinate system for the original data space. Our algorithm can be applied to any set of experts, each of which produces a low-dimensional local representation of a high- dimensional input. Unlike recent efforts to coordinate such models by modifying their objective functions [1, 2], our algorithm is invoked after training and applies an ef\ufb01cient eigensolver to post-process the trained models. The post-processing has no local optima and the size of the sys- tem it must solve scales with the number of local models rather than the number of original data points, making it more ef\ufb01cient than model-free algorithms such as Isomap [3] or LLE [4].\n\n1 Introduction: Local vs. Global Dimensionality Reduction Beyond density modelling, an important goal of unsupervised learning is to discover com- pact, informative representations of high-dimensional data. If the data lie on a smooth low dimensional manifold, then an excellent encoding is the coordinates internal to that man- ifold. The process of determining such coordinates is dimensionality reduction. Linear dimensionality reduction methods such as principal component analysis and factor analy- sis are easy to train but cannot capture the structure of curved manifolds. Mixtures of these simple unsupervised models [5, 6, 7, 8] have been used to perform local dimensionality reduction, and can provide good density models for curved manifolds, but unfortunately such mixtures cannot do dimensionality reduction. They do not describe a single, coher- ent low-dimensional coordinate system for the data since there is no pressure for the local coordinates of each component to agree.\n\nRoweis et al [1] recently proposed a model which performs global coordination of local coordinate systems in a mixture of factor analyzers (MFA). Their model is trained by max- imizing the likelihood of the data, with an additional variational penalty term to encourage the internal coordinates of the factor analyzers to agree. While their model can trade off modelling the data and having consistent local coordinate systems, it requires a user given trade-off parameter, training is quite inef\ufb01cient (although [2] describes an improved train- ing algorithm for a more constrained model), and it has quite serious local minima problems (methods like LLE [4] or Isomap [3] have to be used for initialization).\n\nIn this paper we describe a novel, automatic way to align the hidden representations used by each component of a mixture of dimensionality reducers into a single global representation of the data throughout space. Given an already trained mixture, the alignment is achieved by applying an eigensolver to a matrix constructed from the internal representations of the mixture components. Our method is ef\ufb01cient, simple to implement, and has no local optima in its optimization nor any learning rates or annealing schedules.\n\n\n\n2 The Locally Linear Coordination Algorithm\n\nSuppose we have a set of data points given by the rows of  \t \n\n\n  a -dimensional space, which we assume are sampled from a    fold. We approximate the manifold coordinates using images \n\n !   dimensional embedding space. Suppose also that we have already trained, or have been th reducer produces a%$ dimen- given, a mixture of\" sional internal representation&(' $ for data point )' as well as a \u201cresponsibility\u201d*\t' $,+.- ' $ describing how reliable the# 10 is. These satisfy/\n\nlocal dimensionality reducers. The# th reducer\u2019s representation of\n\nand can be obtained, for example, using a gating network in a mixture of experts, or the posterior probabilities in a probabilistic network. Notice that the manifold coordinates and internal representations need not have the same number of dimensions.\n\nfrom dimensional mani- in a\n\n  \n\nGiven the data, internal representations, and responsibilities, our algorithm automatically aligns the various hidden representations into a single global coordinate system. Two key ideas motivate the method. First, to use a convex cost function whose unique minimum is to\n\nattained at the desired global coordinates. Second, to restrict the global coordinates  ' $ and responsibilities* depend on the data\n\nthereby leveraging the structure of the mixture model to regularize and reduce the effective size of the optimization problem. In effect, rather than working with individual data points, we work with large groups of points belonging to particular submodels.\n\n' only through the local representations &",

We \ufb01nd that Bayesian Monte Carlo outperformed Annealed Importance Sampling, although for very high dimensional problems or problems with massive multimodality BMC may be less adequate.

We present an optimally fast way of incrementally solving each task in the sequence. Bias shifts are computed by program pre\ufb01xes that modify the distribution on their suf- \ufb01xes by reusing successful code for previous tasks (stored in non-modi\ufb01- able memory). No tested program gets more runtime than its probability times the total search time. In illustrative experiments, ours becomes the \ufb01rst general system to learn a universal solver for arbitrary  disk Tow- ers of Hanoi tasks (minimal solution size  ). It demonstrates the advantages of incremental learning by pro\ufb01ting from previously solved, simpler tasks involving samples of a simple context free language.",

        "abstract": "Cortical neurons have been reported to use both rate and temporal  codes. Here we describe a novel mode in which each neuron  generates exactly 0 or 1 action potentials, but not more, in response  to a stimulus. We used cell-attached recording, which ensured  single-unit isolation, to record responses in rat auditory cortex to  brief tone pips. Surprisingly, the majority of neurons exhibited  binary behavior with few multi-spike responses; several dramatic  examples consisted of exactly one spike on 100% of trials, with no  trial-to-trial variability in spike count. Many neurons were tuned to  stimulus frequency. Since individual trials yielded at most one  spike for most neurons, the information about stimulus frequency  was encoded in the population, and would not have been accessible  to later stages of processing that only had access to the activity of a  single unit. These binary units allow a more efficient population  code than is possible with conventional rate coding units, and are  consistent with a model of cortical processing  in which  synchronous packets of spikes propagate stably from one neuronal  population to the next.",

The shape of these functions strongly depends on the length T of the time window within which spikes are counted in order to estimate the under(cid:173) lying firing rate. A phase transition towards pure binary encoding occurs if the maximum mean spike count becomes smaller than approximately three provided the minimum firing rate is zero. For a particular function class, we were able to prove the existence of a second-order phase tran(cid:173) sition analytically. The critical decoding time window length obtained from the analytical derivation is in precise agreement with the numerical results. We conclude that under most circumstances relevant to informa(cid:173) tion processing in the brain, rate coding can be better ascribed to a binary (low-entropy) code than to the other extreme of rich analog coding.",

This algorithm is further extended to nonlinear discriminants using kernel functions satisfy- ing Mercer\u2019s conditions. An ensemble of simple dyadic hypercuts is learned incrementally by means of a con(cid:12)dence-rated version of Ad- aBoost, which provides a sound strategy for searching through the (cid:12)nite set of hypercut hypotheses. In experiments with real-world datasets from the UCI repository, the generalization performance of the hypercut classi(cid:12)ers was found to be comparable to that of SVMs and k-NN classi(cid:12)ers. Furthermore, the computational cost of classi(cid:12)cation (at run time) was found to be similar to, or bet- ter than, that of SVM. Similarly to SVMs, boosted dyadic kernel discriminants tend to maximize the margin (via AdaBoost). In contrast to SVMs, however, we o(cid:11)er an on-line and incremental learning machine for building kernel discriminants whose complex- ity (number of kernel evaluations) can be directly controlled (traded o(cid:11) for accuracy).",

The mapping preserves local geometric relations in the manifold and is pseudo-invertible. We show how to estimate the intrinsic dimensionality of the manifold from samples, decompose the sample data into locally linear low-dimensional patches, merge these patches into a single low- dimensional coordinate system, and compute forward and reverse map- pings between the sample and coordinate spaces. The objective functions are convex and their solutions are given in closed form.",

The dynamics of this circuit model are similar to the dynamics of some present theoretical models of short- term depression except that the recovery dynamics of the variable de- scribing the depression is nonlinear and it also depends on the presynap- tic frequency. The equations describing the steady-state and transient re- sponses of this synaptic model \ufb01t the experimental results obtained from a fabricated silicon network consisting of leaky integrate-and-\ufb01re neu- rons and different types of synapses. We also show experimental data demonstrating the possible computational roles of depression. One pos- sible role of a depressing synapse is that the input can quickly bring the neuron up to threshold when the membrane potential is close to the rest- ing potential.",

The complete system is described by the dynam- ics of its physical network architectures. The combination of the fol- lowing properties makes the system novel: Firstly, the front-end of the system consists of an aVLSI optical \ufb02ow chip that collectively computes 2-D global visual motion in real-time [1]. Secondly, the complexity of the classi\ufb01cation task is signi\ufb01cantly reduced by mapping the continu- ous motion trajectories to sequences of \u2019motion events\u2019. And thirdly, all the network structures are simple and with the exception of the optical \ufb02ow chip based on a Winner-Take-All (WTA) architecture. We demon- strate the application of the proposed generic system for a contactless man-machine interface that allows to write letters by visual motion. Re- garding the low complexity of the system, its robustness and the already existing front-end, a complete aVLSI system-on-chip implementation is realistic, allowing various applications in mobile electronic devices.",

The Fisher score is a vector of parameter derivatives of loglikelihood of a probabilistic model. This paper gives a theoretical analysis about how class information is pre- served in the space of the Fisher score, which turns out that the Fisher score consists of a few important dimensions with class information and many nuisance dimensions. When we perform clustering with the Fisher score, K-Means type methods are obviously inappropriate because they make use of all dimensions. So we will develop a novel but simple clus- tering algorithm specialized for the Fisher score, which can exploit im- portant dimensions. This algorithm is successfully tested in experiments with arti\ufb01cial data and real data (amino acid sequences).",

One motivation of BCI research is to provide a new communication channel substituting normal motor output in patients with severe neuromuscular disabilities. In the last decade, various neuro- physiological cortical processes, such as slow potential shifts, movement related potentials (MRPs) or event-related desynchronization (ERD) of spontaneous EEG rhythms, were shown to be suitable for BCI, and, con- sequently, different independent approaches of extracting BCI-relevant EEG-features for single-trial analysis are under investigation. Here, we present and systematically compare several concepts for combining such EEG-features to improve the single-trial classi\ufb01cation. Feature combi- nations are evaluated on movement imagination experiments with 3 sub- jects where EEG-features are based on either MRPs or ERD, or both. Those combination methods that incorporate the assumption that the sin- gle EEG-features are physiologically mutually independent outperform the plain method of \u2019adding\u2019 evidence where the single-feature vectors are simply concatenated. These results strengthen the hypothesis that MRP and ERD re\ufb02ect at least partially independent aspects of cortical processes and open a new perspective to boost BCI effectiveness.",

A part-based recogni(cid:173) tion system detects object patches, supplies their partial segmentations as  well as knowledge about the spatial configurations of the object.  The goal  of patch grouping is to find a set of patches that conform best to the object  configuration,  while the goal  of pixel grouping is  to  find  a set of pixels  that have  the  best low-level  feature  similarity.  Through pixel-patch  in(cid:173) teractions and between-patch competition encoded in the solution space,  these two processes are realized in  one joint optimization problem.  The  globally optimal partition is obtained by solving a constrained eigenvalue  problem.  We  demonstrate that the  resulting  object segmentation elimi(cid:173) nates false  positives for  the part detection, while  overcoming occlusion  and weak contours for the low-level edge detection.",

The algebraic structure of the ranking poset leads to a simple Bayesian inter- pretation of the conditional model and its special cases.

Next, we analyze a spike-triggered covariance method, variants of which have been recently exploited successfully by Bialek, Simoncelli, and colleagues. These first two methods suf(cid:173) fer from extraneous conditions on their convergence; therefore, we introduce an estimator for the LN model parameters which is de(cid:173) signed to be consistent under general conditions. We provide an algorithm for the computation of this estimator and derive its rate of convergence.

        "abstract": "We introduce a family of classi\ufb02ers based on a physical analogy to an electrostatic system of charged conductors. The family, called Coulomb classi\ufb02ers, includes the two best-known support-vector machines (SVMs), the \u201d{SVM and the C{SVM. In the electrostat- ics analogy, a training example corresponds to a charged conductor at a given location in space, the classi\ufb02cation function corresponds to the electrostatic potential function, and the training objective function corresponds to the Coulomb energy. The electrostatic framework provides not only a novel interpretation of existing algo- rithms and their interrelationships, but it suggests a variety of new methods for SVMs including kernels that bridge the gap between polynomial and radial-basis functions, objective functions that do not require positive-de\ufb02nite kernels, regularization techniques that allow for the construction of an optimal classi\ufb02er in Minkowski space. Based on the framework, we propose novel SVMs and per- form simulation studies to show that they are comparable or su- perior to standard SVMs. The experiments include classi\ufb02cation tasks on data which are represented in terms of their pairwise prox- imities, where a Coulomb Classi\ufb02er outperformed standard SVMs.",

While such procedures are known to lead to optimal predictors in several cases, where su\u2013ciently accurate prior information is available, it has not been clear how they perform when some of the prior assumptions are violated. In this paper we establish data-dependent bounds for such procedures, extending previous randomized approaches such as the Gibbs algorithm to a fully Bayesian setting. The \ufb02nite-sample guarantees established in this work enable the utilization of Bayesian mixture approaches in agnostic settings, where the usual assumptions of the Bayesian paradigm fail to hold. Moreover, the bounds derived can be directly applied to non-Bayesian mixture approaches such as Bagging and Boosting.",

The densities are selected from a parametrized set by constrained maximization of some objective function which measures the average (bounded) difference, i.e. the contrast between discriminative densities. We show that maximiza- tion of the contrast is equivalent to minimization of an approximation of the Bayes risk. Therefore using suitable classes of probability den- sity functions, the resulting maximum contrast classi\ufb01ers (MCCs) can approximate the Bayes rule for the general multiclass case. In particular for a certain parametrization of the density functions we obtain MCCs which have the same functional form as the well-known Support Vec- tor Machines (SVMs). We show that MCC-training in general requires some nonlinear optimization but under certain conditions the problem is concave and can be tackled by a single linear program. We indicate the close relation between SVM- and MCC-training and in particular we show that Linear Programming Machines can be viewed as an approxi- mate realization of MCCs. In the experiments on benchmark data sets, the MCC shows a competitive classi\ufb01cation performance.",

The proposed method combines many of the  advantages of boost(cid:173) ing schemes  with  the efficiency  of dynamic programming methods  and is  attractive both, conceptually and computationally.  In  addi(cid:173) tion, we also discuss alternative approaches based on the Hamming  loss for  label sequences.  The sequence boosting algorithm offers an  interesting alternative to  methods  based  on  HMMs  and  the  more  recently proposed  Conditional Random Fields.  Applications  areas  for the presented technique range from natural language processing  and  information extraction to  computational biology.  We  include  experiments  on  named  entity  recognition  and  part-of-speech  tag(cid:173) ging  which  demonstrate  the  validity  and  competitiveness  of  our  approach.",

Despite the widespread use of classi\ufb01cation trees, theoretical analysis of their performance is scarce. In this paper, we show that a new family of classi\ufb01cation trees, called dyadic classi\ufb01cation trees (DCTs), are near optimal (in a minimax sense) for a very broad range of clas- si\ufb01cation problems. This demonstrates that other schemes (e.g., neural networks, support vector machines) cannot perform signi\ufb01cantly better than DCTs in many cases. We also show that this near optimal perfor- mance is attained with linear (in the number of training data) complexity growing and pruning algorithms. Moreover, the performance of DCTs on benchmark datasets compares favorably to that of standard CART, which is generally more computationally intensive and which does not possess similar near optimality properties. Our analysis stems from the- oretical results on structural risk minimization, on which the pruning rule for DCTs is based.",

For this reason either small latent dimensions or Gaus- sian latent conditional tables linearly dependent on past states are typically considered in order that inference is tractable. We suggest an alternative approach in which the latent variables are modelled using deterministic conditional probability tables. This specialisa- tion has the advantage of tractable inference even for highly com- plex non-linear/non-Gaussian visible conditional probability tables. This approach enables the consideration of highly complex latent dynamics whilst retaining the bene(cid:12)ts of a tractable probabilistic model.",

This might be attempted by us- ing simple (cid:12)lters for smoothing out the high resolution blocks or through applications where substantial prior information is used to imply the textures and shapes which will occur in the images. In this paper we describe an approach which lies between the two extremes. It is a generic unsupervised method which is usable in all domains, but goes beyond simple smoothing methods in what it achieves. We use a dynamic tree-like architecture to model the high resolution data. Approximate conditioning on the low resolution image is achieved through a mean (cid:12)eld approach.",

In  addition,  the  learning  algorithms  arrive  at  a  desired  value  after  polynomial time,  and deviations from a prescribed ELE become ir(cid:173) rational after  polynomial time.

        "abstract": "An essential step in understanding the function of sensory nervous sys- tems is to characterize as accurately as possible the stimulus-response function (SRF) of the neurons that relay and process sensory informa- tion. One increasingly common experimental approach is to present a rapidly varying complex stimulus to the animal while recording the re- sponses of one or more neurons, and then to directly estimate a func- tional transformation of the input that accounts for the neuronal \ufb01ring. The estimation techniques usually employed, such as Wiener \ufb01ltering or other correlation-based estimation of the Wiener or Volterra kernels, are equivalent to maximum likelihood estimation in a Gaussian-output-noise regression model. We explore the use of Bayesian evidence-optimization techniques to condition these estimates. We show that by learning hyper- parameters that control the smoothness and sparsity of the transfer func- tion it is possible to improve dramatically the quality of SRF estimates, as measured by their success in predicting responses to novel input.",

The basic idea is to represent the original problem on the graph with cy- cles as a convex combination of tree-structured problems. A convexity argument then guarantees that the optimal value of the original problem (i.e., the log probability of the MAP assignment) is upper bounded by the combined optimal values of the tree problems. We prove that this upper bound is met with equality if and only if the tree problems share an opti- mal con\ufb01guration in common. An important implication is that any such shared con\ufb01guration must also be the MAP con\ufb01guration for the original problem. Next we develop a tree-reweighted max-product algorithm for attempting to \ufb01nd convex combinations of tree-structured problems that share a common optimum. We give necessary and suf\ufb01cient conditions for a \ufb01xed point to yield the exact MAP estimate. An attractive feature of our analysis is that it generalizes naturally to convex combinations of hypertree-structured distributions.",

Here, we re- \ufb01ne our previous theory of acetylcholine\u2019s role in cortical inference in the (oxymoronic) terms of expected uncertainty, and advocate a theory for norepinephrine in terms of unexpected uncertainty. We suggest that norepinephrine reports the radical divergence of bottom-up inputs from prevailing top-down interpretations, to in\ufb02uence inference and plasticity. We illustrate this proposal using an adaptive factor analysis model.",

        "abstract": "The problem of extracting the relevant aspects of data, in face of multiple con\ufb02icting structures, is inherent to modeling of complex data. Extract- ing structure in one random variable that is relevant for another variable has been principally addressed recently via the information bottleneck method [15]. However, such auxiliary variables often contain more in- formation than is actually required due to structures that are irrelevant for the task. In many other cases it is in fact easier to specify what is irrelevant than what is, for the task at hand. Identifying the relevant structures, however, can thus be considerably improved by also mini- mizing the information about another, irrelevant, variable. In this paper we give a general formulation of this problem and derive its formal, as well as algorithmic, solution. Its operation is demonstrated in a synthetic example and in two real world problems in the context of text categoriza- tion and face images. While the original information bottleneck problem is related to rate distortion theory, with the distortion measure replaced by the relevant information, extracting relevant features while removing irrelevant ones is related to rate distortion with side information.",

The scaling of our method is at most O(n (cid:1) d2), and in large real-world classi(cid:12)cation experiments we show that it can match prediction performance of the popular support vector machine (SVM), yet can be signi(cid:12)cantly faster in training.

Rows and columns of these matrices correspond to objects, where row and column ob- jects may belong to di\ufb01erent sets, and the entries in the matrix express the relationships between them. We interpret the matrix el- ements as being produced by an unknown kernel which operates on object pairs and we show that - under mild assumptions - these ker- nels correspond to dot products in some (unknown) feature space. Minimizing a bound for the generalization error of a linear classi- \ufb02er which has been obtained using covering numbers we derive an objective function for model selection according to the principle of structural risk minimization. The new objective function has the advantage that it allows the analysis of matrices which are not pos- itive de\ufb02nite, and not even symmetric or square. We then consider the case that row objects are interpreted as features. We suggest an additional constraint, which imposes sparseness on the row objects and show, that the method can then be used for feature selection. Finally, we apply this method to data obtained from DNA microar- rays, where \\column\" objects correspond to samples, \\row\" objects correspond to genes and matrix elements correspond to expression levels. Benchmarks are conducted using standard one-gene classi\ufb02- cation and support vector machines and K-nearest neighbors after standard feature selection. Our new method extracts a sparse set of genes and provides superior classi\ufb02cation results.",

        "abstract": "We address the question of feature selection in the context of visual recognition. It is shown that, besides ef\ufb01cient from a computational standpoint, the infomax principle is nearly optimal in the minimum Bayes error sense. The concept of marginal diversity is introduced, lead- ing to a generic principle for feature selection (the principle of maximum marginal diversity) of extreme computational simplicity. The relation- ships between infomax and the maximization of marginal diversity are identi\ufb01ed, uncovering the existence of a family of classi\ufb01cation proce- dures for which near optimal (in the Bayes error sense) feature selection does not require combinatorial search. Examination of this family in light of recent studies on the statistics of natural images suggests that visual recognition problems are a subset of it.",

Feature selection for clustering is dif\ufb01cult due to the absence of class labels. We propose two approaches to feature selection in the context of Gaussian mixture-based clustering. In the \ufb01rst one, instead of making hard selections, we estimate feature saliencies. An expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm is derived for this task. The second approach extends Koller and Sahami\u2019s mutual-information- based feature relevance criterion to the unsupervised case. Feature selec- tion is then carried out by a backward search scheme. This scheme can be classi\ufb01ed as a \u201cwrapper\u201d, since it wraps mixture estimation in an outer layer that performs feature selection. Experimental results on synthetic and real data show that both methods have promising performance.",

        "abstract": "AdaBoost [3] minimizes an upper error bound which is an exponential function of the margin on the training set [14]. However, the ultimate goal in applications of pattern classi\ufb01cation is always minimum error rate. On the other hand, AdaBoost needs an effective procedure for learning weak classi\ufb01ers, which by itself is dif\ufb01cult especially for high dimensional data. In this paper, we present a novel procedure, called FloatBoost, for learning a better boosted classi\ufb01er. FloatBoost uses a backtrack mechanism after each iteration of AdaBoost to remove weak classi\ufb01ers which cause higher error rates. The resulting \ufb02oat-boosted classi\ufb01er consists of fewer weak classi\ufb01ers yet achieves lower error rates than AdaBoost in both training and test. We also propose a statistical model for learning weak classi\ufb01ers, based on a stagewise approximation of the posterior using an overcomplete set of scalar features. Experi- mental comparisons of FloatBoost and AdaBoost are provided through a dif\ufb01cult classi\ufb01cation problem, face detection, where the goal is to learn from training examples a highly nonlinear classi\ufb01er to differentiate be- tween face and nonface patterns in a high dimensional space. The results clearly demonstrate the promises made by FloatBoost over AdaBoost.",

A limitation of the standard algorithm is that clique marginals are computed as if there were no loops in the graph. To overcome this limitation, we introduce fractional belief propagation. Fractional belief propagation is formulated in terms of a family of ap- proximate free energies, which includes the Bethe free energy and the naive mean-\ufb01eld free as special cases.

In  this  paper  we  therefore  study  ways  to  work  around  this  problem.  First,  we  present  an  alternative  embedding  to  multi-dimensional  scaling  (MDS)  that  allows  us  to  apply  a  variety  of classical  ma(cid:173) chine learning and signal processing algorithms.  The class of pair(cid:173) wise grouping algorithms which share the shift-invariance property  is  statistically  invariant  under  this  embedding  procedure,  leading  to  identical assignments  of objects to clusters.  Based on this  new  vectorial  representation,  denoising  methods  are  applied  in  a  sec(cid:173) ond  step.  Both steps  provide a  theoretically  well  controlled setup  to  translate  from  pairwise  data  to  the  respective  denoised  met(cid:173) ric  representation.

Function prediction experiments for the genes of the yeast S.

The Markov chain\u2019s behaviour is characterized by the spectral properties of the matrix of transition probabilities, from which we derive eigen\ufb02ows along with their hal\ufb02ives. An eigen\ufb02ow describes the \ufb02ow of probabil- ity mass due to the Markov chain, and it is characterized by its eigen- value, or equivalently, by the hal\ufb02ife of its decay as the Markov chain is iterated. A ideal stable cluster is one with zero eigen\ufb02ow and in\ufb01- nite half-life. The key insight in this paper is that bottlenecks between weakly coupled clusters can be identi\ufb01ed by computing the sensitivity of the eigen\ufb02ow\u2019s hal\ufb02ife to variations in the edge weights. We propose a novel EIGENCUTS algorithm to perform clustering that removes these identi\ufb01ed bottlenecks in an iterative fashion.",

We have developed a variational Bayesian method to perform Independent Component Analysis (ICA) on high-dimensional data containing missing entries. Missing data are handled naturally in the Bayesian framework by integrating the generative density model. Mod- eling the distributions of the independent sources with mixture of Gaus- sians allows sources to be estimated with different kurtosis and skewness. The variational Bayesian method automatically determines the dimen- sionality of the data and yields an accurate density model for the ob- served data without over\ufb01tting problems. This allows direct probability estimation of missing values in the high dimensional space and avoids dimension reduction preprocessing which is not feasible with missing data.",

        "abstract": "Cortical synaptic plasticity depends on the relative timing of pre- and postsynaptic spikes and also on the temporal pattern of presynaptic spikes and of postsynaptic spikes. We study the hypothesis that cortical synap- tic plasticity does not associate individual spikes, but rather whole \ufb01r- ing episodes, and depends only on when these episodes start and how long they last, but as little as possible on the timing of individual spikes. Here we present the mathematical background for such a study. Stan- dard methods from hidden Markov models are used to de\ufb01ne what \u201c\ufb01r- ing episodes\u201d are. Estimating the probability of being in such an episode requires not only the knowledge of past spikes, but also of future spikes. We show how to construct a causal learning rule, which depends only on past spikes, but associates pre- and postsynaptic \ufb01ring episodes as if it also knew future spikes. We also show that this learning rule agrees with some features of synaptic plasticity in super\ufb01cial layers of rat visual cortex (Froemke and Dan, Nature 416:433, 2002).",

        "abstract": "By comparison to some other sensory cortices, the functional proper- ties of cells in the primary auditory cortex are not yet well understood. Recent attempts to obtain a generalized description of auditory cortical responses have often relied upon characterization of the spectrotempo- ral receptive \ufb01eld (STRF), which amounts to a model of the stimulus- response function (SRF) that is linear in the spectrogram of the stimulus. How well can such a model account for neural responses at the very \ufb01rst stages of auditory cortical processing? To answer this question, we de- velop a novel methodology for evaluating the fraction of stimulus-related response power in a population that can be captured by a given type of SRF model. We use this technique to show that, in the thalamo-recipient layers of primary auditory cortex, STRF models account for no more than 40% of the stimulus-related power in neural responses.",

It arises whenever objects are not labeled with unique identi\ufb01ers or when those identi\ufb01ers may not be perceived perfectly. In such cases, two ob- servations may or may not correspond to the same object. In this paper, we consider the problem in the context of citation matching\u2014the prob- lem of deciding which citations correspond to the same publication. Our approach is based on the use of a relational probability model to de\ufb01ne a generative model for the domain, including models of author and title corruption and a probabilistic citation grammar. Identity uncertainty is handled by extending standard models to incorporate probabilities over the possible mappings between terms in the language and objects in the domain. Inference is based on Markov chain Monte Carlo, augmented with speci\ufb01c methods for generating ef\ufb01cient proposals when the domain contains many objects. Results on several citation data sets show that the method outperforms current algorithms for citation matching. The declarative, relational nature of the model also means that our algorithm can determine object characteristics such as author names by combining multiple citations of multiple papers.",

The main objective was to improve the trans- fer rates based on of\ufb02ine analysis of EEG-data but within a more realistic setup closer to an online realization than in the original studies. The ob- jective was achieved along two different tracks: on the one hand we used state-of-the-art machine learning techniques for signal classi\ufb01cation and on the other hand we augmented the data space by using more electrodes for the interface. For the classi\ufb01cation task we utilized SVMs and, as mo- tivated by recent \ufb01ndings on the learning of discriminative densities, we accumulated the values of the classi\ufb01cation function in order to combine several classi\ufb01cations, which \ufb01nally lead to signi\ufb01cantly improved rates as compared with techniques applied in the original work. In combina- tion with the data space augmentation, we achieved competitive transfer rates at an average of 50.5 bits/min and with a maximum of 84.7 bits/min.",

In this paper we describe a technique that im- proves a simple web page classi\ufb01er\u2019s performance on pages from a new, unseen web site, by exploiting link structure within a site as well as page structure within hub pages. On real-world test cases, this technique signi\ufb01cantly and substantially improves the accuracy of a bag-of-words classi\ufb01er, reducing error rate by about half, on average. The system uses a variant of co-training to exploit unlabeled data from a new site. Pages are labeled using the base classi\ufb01er; the results are used by a restricted wrapper-learner to propose potential \u201cmain-category anchor wrappers\u201d; and \ufb01nally, these wrappers are used as features by a third learner to \ufb01nd a categorization of the site that implies a simple hub structure, but which also largely agrees with the original bag-of-words classi\ufb01er.",

Working with a subset of active basis functions, the sparsity of the RVM solution will ensure that the number of basis functions and thereby the computational complexity is kept low. We also introduce a mean \ufb01eld approach to the intractable classi\ufb01cation model that is ex- pected to give a very good approximation to exact Bayesian inference and contains the Laplace approximation as a special case. We test the algorithms on two large data sets with O(103 (cid:0) 104) examples. The re- sults indicate that Bayesian learning of large data sets, e.g. the MNIST database is realistic.",

        "abstract": "The problem of learning a semantic representation of a text document from data is addressed, in the situation where a corpus of unlabeled paired documents is available, each pair being formed by a short En- glish document and its French translation. This representation can then be used for any retrieval, categorization or clustering task, both in a stan- dard and in a cross-lingual setting. By using kernel functions, in this case simple bag-of-words inner products, each part of the corpus is mapped to a high-dimensional space. The correlations between the two spaces are then learnt by using kernel Canonical Correlation Analysis. A set of directions is found in the \ufb01rst and in the second space that are max- imally correlated. Since we assume the two representations are com- pletely independent apart from the semantic content, any correlation be- tween them should re\ufb02ect some semantic similarity. Certain patterns of English words that relate to a speci\ufb01c meaning should correlate with cer- tain patterns of French words corresponding to the same meaning, across the corpus. Using the semantic representation obtained in this way we \ufb01rst demonstrate that the correlations detected between the two versions of the corpus are signi\ufb01cantly higher than random, and hence that a rep- resentation based on such features does capture statistical patterns that should re\ufb02ect semantic information. Then we use such representation both in cross-language and in single-language retrieval tasks, observing performance that is consistently and signi\ufb01cantly superior to LSI on the same data.",

Based on the heat equation on the Riemannian manifold de\ufb01ned by the Fisher informa- tion metric, information diffusion kernels generalize the Gaussian kernel of Euclidean space, and provide a natural way of combining generative statistical modeling with non-parametric discriminative learning. As a special case, the kernels give a new approach to applying kernel-based learning algorithms to discrete data.

        "abstract": "The responses of cortical sensory neurons are notoriously variable, with the number of spikes evoked by identical stimuli varying signi\ufb01cantly from trial to trial. This variability is most often interpreted as \u2018noise\u2019, purely detrimental to the sensory system. In this paper, we propose an al- ternative view in which the variability is related to the uncertainty, about world parameters, which is inherent in the sensory stimulus. Speci\ufb01- cally, the responses of a population of neurons are interpreted as stochas- tic samples from the posterior distribution in a latent variable model. In addition to giving theoretical arguments supporting such a representa- tional scheme, we provide simulations suggesting how some aspects of response variability might be understood in this framework.",

We cast the kernel design problem as the construction of an accurate kernel from simple (and less accurate) base kernels. We use the boosting paradigm to perform the kernel construction process. To do so, we modify the booster so as to accommodate kernel operators. We also devise an ef\ufb01cient weak-learner for simple kernels that is based on generalized eigen vector decomposition. We demonstrate the effective- ness of our approach on synthetic data and on the USPS dataset. On the USPS dataset, the performance of the Perceptron algorithm with learned kernels is systematically better than a \ufb01xed RBF kernel.",

How(cid:173) ever,  this  method is  highly constrained by the curse of dimension(cid:173) ality  which  limits  it  to  simple  theoretical simulations.  This  paper  demonstrates that by using a different but closely-related objective  function for extracting slowly varying features ([2,  3]),  and then ex(cid:173) ploiting the kernel trick, this  curse can be avoided.  Using this new  method we  show that  both the  complex cell  properties of transla(cid:173) tion invariance  and  disparity  coding  can  be  learnt  simultaneously  from  natural images when complex cells  are driven by simple cells  also learnt from  the image.",

This task can be approached as a factorial learning problem, where each image must be explained by instantiating a model for each of the objects present with the correct instantiation parameters. A major problem with learning a factorial model is that as the number of objects increases, there is a combinatorial explosion of the number of con\ufb01gurations that need to be considered. We develop a method to extract object models sequentially from the data by making use of a robust statistical method, thus avoid- ing the combinatorial explosion, and present results showing successful extraction of objects from real images.",

        "abstract": "Many control problems take place in continuous state-action spaces, e.g., as in manipulator robotics, where the control objective is of- ten de\ufb02ned as \ufb02nding a desired trajectory that reaches a particular goal state. While reinforcement learning o\ufb01ers a theoretical frame- work to learn such control policies from scratch, its applicability to higher dimensional continuous state-action spaces remains rather limited to date. Instead of learning from scratch, in this paper we suggest to learn a desired complex control policy by transforming an existing simple canonical control policy. For this purpose, we represent canonical policies in terms of di\ufb01erential equations with well-de\ufb02ned attractor properties. By nonlinearly transforming the canonical attractor dynamics using techniques from nonparametric regression, almost arbitrary new nonlinear policies can be gener- ated without losing the stability properties of the canonical sys- tem. We demonstrate our techniques in the context of learning a set of movement skills for a humanoid robot from demonstrations of a human teacher. Policies are acquired rapidly, and, due to the properties of well formulated di\ufb01erential equations, can be re-used and modi\ufb02ed on-line under dynamic changes of the environment. The linear parameterization of nonparametric regression moreover lends itself to recognize and classify previously learned movement skills. Evaluations in simulations and on an actual 30 degree-of- freedom humanoid robot exemplify the feasibility and robustness of our approach.",

The algorithms are based on a measure known as the kernel generalized variance (KGV), which essentially allows us to treat all variables on an equal footing as Gaussians in a feature space obtained from Mercer kernels. Thus we are able to learn hybrid graphs involving discrete and continuous variables of arbitrary type. We explore the computational properties of our approach, showing how to use the kernel trick to compute the relevant statistics in linear time. We illustrate our framework with experiments involving discrete and continuous data.",

        "abstract": "The standard representation of text documents as bags of words  suffers from well known limitations, mostly due to its inability to  exploit semantic similarity between terms. Attempts to incorpo(cid:173) rate some notion of term similarity include latent semantic index(cid:173) ing [8], the use of semantic networks [9], and probabilistic methods  [5]. In this paper we propose two methods for inferring such sim(cid:173) ilarity from a corpus. The first one defines word-similarity based  on document-similarity and viceversa, giving rise to a system of  equations whose equilibrium point we use to obtain a semantic  similarity measure. The second method models semantic relations  by means of a diffusion process on a graph defined by lexicon and  co-occurrence information. Both approaches produce valid kernel  functions parametrised by a real number. The paper shows how  the alignment measure can be used to successfully perform model  selection over this parameter. Combined with the use of support  vector machines we obtain positive results.",

The prior consists of a mixture of a Gaussian and a Dirac delta function, and thus encourages coe(cid:14)cients to have exact zero values. Coe(cid:14)cients for an image are computed by sampling from the resulting posterior distribution with a Gibbs sampler. The learned basis is similar to the Steerable Pyramid basis, and yields slightly higher SNR for the same number of active coe(cid:14)cients. De- noising using the learned image model is demonstrated for some standard test images, with results that compare favorably with other denoising methods.",

If the t-distribution is used to model the combined outputs of sets of neurally adjacent \ufb01lters, the sys- tem learns a topographic map in which the orientation, spatial frequency and location of the \ufb01lters change smoothly across the map. Even though maximum likelihood learning is intractable in our model, the product form allows a relatively ef\ufb01cient learning procedure that works well even for highly overcomplete sets of \ufb01lters.

The simplest form of a feedback is a re\ufb02ex. Re\ufb02exes occur always \u201ctoo late\u201d; i.e., only after a (unpleas- ant, painful, dangerous) re\ufb02ex-eliciting sensor event has occurred. This de\ufb01nes an objective problem which can be solved if another sensor input exists which can predict the primary re\ufb02ex and can generate an earlier reaction. In contrast to previous approaches, our linear learning algo- rithm allows for an analytical proof that this system learns to apply feed- forward control with the result that slow feedback loops are replaced by their equivalent feed-forward controller creating a forward model. In other words, learning turns the reactive system into a pro-active system. By means of a robot implementation we demonstrate the applicability of the theoretical results which can be used in a variety of different areas in physics and engineering.",

        "abstract": "We consider a statistical framework for learning in a class of net- works of spiking neurons. Our aim is to show how optimal local learning rules can be readily derived once the neural dynamics and desired functionality of the neural assembly have been speci\ufb02ed, in contrast to other models which assume (sub-optimal) learning rules. Within this framework we derive local rules for learning tem- poral sequences in a model of spiking neurons and demonstrate its superior performance to correlation (Hebbian) based approaches. We further show how to include mechanisms such as synaptic de- pression and outline how the framework is readily extensible to learning in networks of highly complex spiking neurons. A stochas- tic quantal vesicle release mechanism is considered and implications on the complexity of learning discussed.",

Our method requires full observability and communication during learning, but the learned poli- cies can be executed in a distributed manner. The value function is rep- resented as a factored linear architecture and its structure determines the necessary computational resources and communication bandwidth. This approach permits a tradeoff between simple representations with little or no communication between agents and complex, computationally inten- sive representations with extensive coordination between agents. Thus, we provide a principled means of using approximation to combat the exponential blowup in the joint action space of the participants. The ap- proach is demonstrated with an example that shows the ef\ufb01ciency gains over naive enumeration.",

This percept is puzzling. First, why do we choose the \\more complicated\" description with two images rather than the \\simpler\" explanation I(x; y) = I1(x; y) + 0 ? Sec- ond, given the in\ufb02nite number of ways to express I as a sum of two images, how do we compute the \\best\" decomposition ? Here we suggest that transparency is the rational percept of a sys- tem that is adapted to the statistics of natural scenes. We present a probabilistic model of images based on the qualitative statistics of derivative \ufb02lters and \\corner detectors\" in natural scenes and use this model to \ufb02nd the most probable decomposition of a novel image. The optimization is performed using loopy belief propa- gation.

        "abstract": "The tangential neurons in the \ufb02y brain are sensitive to the typical optic \ufb02ow patterns generated during self-motion. In this study, we examine whether a simpli\ufb01ed linear model of these neurons can be used to esti- mate self-motion from the optic \ufb02ow. We present a theory for the con- struction of an estimator consisting of a linear combination of optic \ufb02ow vectors that incorporates prior knowledge both about the distance distri- bution of the environment, and about the noise and self-motion statistics of the sensor. The estimator is tested on a gantry carrying an omnidirec- tional vision sensor. The experiments show that the proposed approach leads to accurate and robust estimates of rotation rates, whereas transla- tion estimates turn out to be less reliable.",

        "abstract": "Given a set of hidden variables with an a-priori Markov structure, we derive an online algorithm which approximately updates the posterior as pairwise measurements between the hidden variables become available. The update is performed using Assumed Density Filtering: to incorporate each pairwise measurement, we compute the optimal Markov structure which represents the true posterior and use it as a prior for incorporating the next measurement. We demonstrate the resulting algorithm by cal- culating globally consistent trajectories of a robot as it navigates along a 2D trajectory. To update a trajectory of length t, the update takes O(t). When all conditional distributions are linear-Gaussian, the algorithm can be thought of as a Kalman Filter which simpli\ufb01es the state covariance matrix after incorporating each measurement.",

Most non-parametric methods take this similarity to be \ufb01xed, but much recent work has shown the advantages of learning it, in particular to exploit the local invariances in the data or to capture the possibly non-linear manifold on which most of the data lies. We propose a new non-parametric kernel density estimation method which captures the local structure of an underlying manifold through the leading eigen- vectors of regularized local covariance matrices. Experiments in density estimation show signi\ufb01cant improvements with respect to Parzen density estimators. The density estimators can also be used within Bayes classi- \ufb01ers, yielding classi\ufb01cation rates similar to SVMs and much superior to the Parzen classi\ufb01er.",

Building on the analysis of a re- stricted version of our model, we derive a general \ufb01ltering rule based on the margin of a ridge regression estimator. While our rule may observe the label of a vector only by classfying the vector as relevant, experiments on a real-world document \ufb01ltering problem show that the performance of our rule is close to that of the on-line classi\ufb01er which is allowed to observe all labels. These empirical results are complemented by a theo- retical analysis where we consider a randomized variant of our rule and prove that its expected number of mistakes is never much larger than that of the optimal \ufb01ltering rule which knows the hidden linear model.",

Mean-\ufb01eld methods are applied to analyze the model and derive ef\ufb01cient practical algorithms to estimate the parameters in the problem. The hyperparameters are es- timated by a fast approximate leave-one-out cross-validation procedure based on the cavity method. The algorithm is further evaluated on several benchmark databases by comparing with standard algorithms in IR.",

As an example, we applied our method to a simulated \ufb01ve link biped robot. The results show lower joint torques from the optimal con- trol policy compared to a hand-tuned PD servo controller. Results also show that the simulated biped robot can successfully walk with unknown disturbances that cause controllers generated by standard differential dy- namic programming and the hand-tuned PD servo to fail. Learning to compensate for modeling error and previously unknown disturbances in conjunction with robust control design is also demonstrated.",

We compute the kernels ef\ufb01ciently using a mismatch tree data structure and report experiments on a benchmark SCOP dataset, where we show that the mismatch kernel used with an SVM classi\ufb01er performs as well as the Fisher kernel, the most success- ful method for remote homology detection, while achieving considerable computational savings.",

We show that by focusing on average responses one may miss the existence of factorial coding mechanisms that become only apparent when analyzing spike count histograms. We show evidence suggesting that the classical/non-classical receptive \ufb01eld organization in the cortex effectively enforces the development of Morton-style factorial codes. This may provide some cues to help understand perceptual cod- ing in the brain and to develop new unsupervised learning algorithms. While methods like ICA (Bell & Sejnowski, 1997) develop independent codes, in Morton-style coding the goal is to make two or more external aspects of the world become independent when conditioning on internal representations.",

In this framework a multiclass predictor is composed of a pair of embeddings that map both instances and labels into a common space. In this space each instance is assigned the label it is nearest to. We outline and analyze an algorithm, termed Bunching, for learning the pair of embeddings from labeled data. A key construction in the analysis of the algorithm is the notion of probabilistic output codes, a generaliza- tion of error correcting output codes (ECOC). Furthermore, the method of multiclass categorization using ECOC is shown to be an instance of Bunching. We demonstrate the advantage of Bunching over ECOC by comparing their performance on numerous categorization problems.",

        "abstract": "We propose a model that can learn parts-based representations of high- dimensional data. Our key assumption is that the dimensions of the data can be separated into several disjoint subsets, or factors, which take on values independently of each other. We assume each factor has a small number of discrete states, and model it using a vector quantizer. The selected states of each factor represent the multiple causes of the input. Given a set of training examples, our model learns the association of data dimensions with factors, as well as the states of each VQ. Inference and learning are carried out ef\ufb01ciently via variational algorithms. We present applications of this model to problems in image decomposition, collaborative \ufb01ltering, and text classi\ufb01cation.",

The updates have a simple closed form, and we prove that they converge monotoni- cally to the solution of the maximum margin hyperplane. The updates optimize the traditionally proposed objective function for SVMs. They do not involve any heuristics such as choosing a learning rate or deciding which variables to update at each iteration. They can be used to adjust all the quadratic programming variables in parallel with a guarantee of im- provement at each iteration. We analyze the asymptotic convergence of the updates and show that the coef\ufb01cients of non-support vectors decay geometrically to zero at a rate that depends on their margins. In practice, the updates converge very rapidly to good classi\ufb01ers.",

We provide a formal analysis and exper- imental evidence demonstrating that NashProp performs well on large graphical games with many loops, often converging in just a dozen itera- tions on graphs with hundreds of nodes. NashProp generalizes the tree algorithm of (Kearns et al. 2001), and can be viewed as similar in spirit to belief propagation in probabilis- tic inference, and thus complements the recent work of (Vickrey and Koller 2002), who explored a junction tree approach. Thus, as for prob- abilistic inference, we have at least two promising general-purpose ap- proaches to equilibria computation in graphs.",

We develop a real-time control system using the spiking activity of approximately 40 neurons recorded with an electrode array implanted in the arm area of primary motor cortex. In contrast to previous work, we develop a control-theoretic approach that explicitly models the motion of the hand and the probabilistic re- lationship between this motion and the mean \ufb01ring rates of the cells in 70 bins. We focus on a realistic cursor control task in which the sub- ject must move a cursor to \u201chit\u201d randomly placed targets on a computer monitor. Encoding and decoding of the neural data is achieved with a Kalman \ufb01lter which has a number of advantages over previous linear \ufb01ltering techniques. In particular, the Kalman \ufb01lter reconstructions of hand trajectories in off-line experiments are more accurate than previ- ously reported results and the model provides insights into the nature of the neural coding of movement.",

We have developed a trajectory-based approach, in which policies and value functions are represented nonparametrically along tra- jectories. These trajectories, policies, and value functions are updated as the value function becomes more accurate or as a model of the task is up- dated. We have applied this approach to periodic tasks such as hopping and walking, which required handling discount factors and discontinu- ities in the task dynamics, and using function approximation to represent value functions at discontinuities. We also describe extensions of the ap- proach to make the policies more robust to modeling error and sensor noise.",

We provide generalization error bounds by estimating the Rademacher complexities of the corresponding function classes. In particular we obtain a complexity bound for function classes induced by kernels with given eigenvectors, i.e., we allow to vary the spectrum and keep the eigenvectors \ufb01x. This bound is only a loga- rithmic factor bigger than the complexity of the function class induced by a single kernel. However, optimizing the margin over such classes leads to over\ufb01tting. We thus propose a suitable way of constraining the class. We use an ef\ufb01cient algorithm to solve the resulting optimization problem, present preliminary experimental results, and compare them to an alignment-based approach.",

        "abstract": "A  common  objective  in  learning  a  model  from  data is  to  recover  its network structure,  while the model parameters are of minor in(cid:173) terest.  For example,  we  may  wish  to  recover  regulatory  networks  from high-throughput data sources.  In  this paper we  examine how  Bayesian  regularization  using  a  product  of independent  Dirichlet  priors over  the model  parameters affects  the  learned model  struc(cid:173) ture  in  a  domain  with  discrete  variables.  We  show  that  a  small  scale  parameter - often interpreted as  \"equivalent sample size\"  or  \"prior  strength\"  - leads  to  a  strong  regularization  of  the  model  structure (sparse graph)  given a  sufficiently large data set.  In  par(cid:173) ticular, the empty graph is obtained in the limit of a vanishing scale  parameter.  This is  diametrically opposite to what one may expect  in  this  limit,  namely  the  complete graph from  an  (unregularized)  maximum likelihood estimate.  Since  the prior affects  the parame(cid:173) ters as  expected, the scale parameter balances a  trade-off  between  regularizing  the  parameters  vs.  the  structure  of  the  model.  We  demonstrate  the  benefits  of optimizing  this  trade-off in  the  sense  of predictive accuracy.",

These applications come from the areas of machine diagnostics, fault detection, illness identi\ufb01cation or, in principle, refer to any prob- lem where little knowledge is available outside the typical class. In this paper we explain why proximities are natural representations for domain descriptors and we propose a simple one-class classi\ufb01er for dissimilarity representations. By the use of linear programming an ef\ufb01cient one-class description can be found, based on a small number of prototype objects. This classi\ufb01er can be made (1) more robust by transforming the dissimi- larities and (2) cheaper to compute by using a reduced representation set. Finally, a comparison to a comparable one-class classi\ufb01er by Campbell and Bennett is given.",

We introduce two main approaches: the first is the  \"fixed margin\" policy in which the margin of the closest neighboring  classes is being maximized - which turns out to be a direct generaliza(cid:173) tion of SVM to ranking learning. The second approach allows for k - 1  different margins where the sum of margins is maximized. This approach  is shown to reduce to lI-SVM when the number of classes k = 2. Both  approaches are optimal in size of 21 where I is the total number of training  examples. Experiments performed on visual classification and \"collab(cid:173) orative filtering\" show that both approaches outperform existing ordinal  regression algorithms applied for ranking and multi-class SVM applied  to general multi-class classification.",

The front end performs the signal processing for voice-driven agents that attend to the pitch contours of human speech and provide continuous audiovisual feedback. The al- gorithm we use for pitch tracking has several distinguishing features: it makes no use of FFTs or autocorrelation at the pitch period; it updates the pitch incrementally on a sample-by-sample basis; it avoids peak picking and does not require interpolation in time or frequency to obtain high res- olution estimates; and it works reliably over a four octave range, in real time, without the need for postprocessing to produce smooth contours. The algorithm is based on two simple ideas in neural computation: the introduction of a purposeful nonlinearity, and the error signal of a least squares \ufb01t. The pitch tracker is used in two real time multimedia applica- tions: a voice-to-MIDI player that synthesizes electronic music from vo- calized melodies, and an audiovisual Karaoke machine with multimodal feedback. Both applications run on a laptop and display the user\u2019s pitch scrolling across the screen as he or she sings into the computer.",

In many real time applications of particle \ufb01lters, however, sensor information arrives at a signi\ufb01cantly higher rate than the update rate of the \ufb01lter. The prevalent approach to dealing with such situations is to update the particle \ufb01lter as often as possible and to discard sensor information that cannot be processed in time. In this paper we present real-time particle \ufb01l- ters, which make use of all sensor information even when the \ufb01lter update rate is below the update rate of the sensors. This is achieved by represent- ing posteriors as mixtures of sample sets, where each mixture component integrates one observation arriving during a \ufb01lter update. The weights of the mixture components are set so as to minimize the approximation error introduced by the mixture representation. Thereby, our approach focuses computational resources (samples) on valuable sensor information. Exper- iments using data collected with a mobile robot show that our approach yields strong improvements over other approaches.",

The distinction is computed from the spike times of the two neurons in response to a white noise stimulus. Although the method is based on a highly idealized linear-nonlinear approximation of neural response, we demonstrate via simulation that the approach can work with a more re- alistic, integrate-and-\ufb01re neuron model. We propose that the approach exempli\ufb01ed by this analysis may yield viable tools for reconstructing stimulus-driven neural networks from data gathered in neurophysiology experiments.",

Several successful tracking algorithms have been developed that model human body as an articulated tree. We pro- pose a learning-based method for creating such articulated models from observations of multiple rigid motions. This paper is concerned with recovering topology of the articulated model, when the rigid motion of constituent segments is known. Our approach is based on \ufb01nding the Maximum Likelihood tree shaped factorization of the joint probability density function (PDF) of rigid segment motions. The topology of graph- ical model formed from this factorization corresponds to topology of the underlying articulated body. We demonstrate the performance of our al- gorithm on both synthetic and real motion capture data.",

Previous work has demon- strated the feasibility of implementing this method and proved that the technique is unbiased in both discrete and continuous domains. In this paper we present a reformulation of greedy importance sampling that eliminates the free parameters from the original estimator, and introduces a new regularization strategy that further reduces variance without com- promising unbiasedness. The resulting estimator is shown to be effective for dif\ufb01cult estimation problems arising in Markov random \ufb01eld infer- ence. In particular, improvements are achieved over standard MCMC estimators when the distribution has multiple peaked modes.",

In the presence of multi- ple Nash equilibria, even agents with non-con\ufb02icting interests may not be able to learn an optimal coordination policy. The problem is exac- cerbated if the agents do not know the game and independently receive noisy payoffs. So, multiagent reinforfcement learning involves two inter- related problems: identifying the game and learning to play. In this paper, we present optimal adaptive learning, the \ufb01rst algorithm that converges to an optimal Nash equilibrium with probability 1 in any team Markov game. We provide a convergence proof, and show that the algorithm\u2019s parameters are easy to set to meet the convergence conditions.",

The learning rate must scale with  the system size in a  problem-dependent way.  This is  shown in two  problems:  the needle-in-a haystack, in which the learning rate must  vanish exponentially in the  system size,  and in  a  smooth function  in  which  the  learning rate must  vanish  like  the  square root of the  system size.  Two methods are proposed for  removing this sensitiv(cid:173) ity.  A learning dynamics which obeys detailed balance is shown to  give consistent performance over the entire range of learning rates.  An  analog  of mutation  is  shown  to  require  a  learning  rate  which  scales as  the inverse system size, but is  problem independent.",

Training in each boosting round proceeds in three stages: \ufb01rst we sample negative examples from the model\u2019s current Boltzmann distribution. Next, a fea- ture is trained to improve classi\ufb01cation performance between data and negative examples. Finally, a coef\ufb01cient is learned which determines the importance of this feature relative to ones already in the pool. Negative examples only need to be generated once to learn each new feature.

Real-world scenes (eg, albedos or shapes) can be very complex, conventionally requiring high dimensional representations which are hard to estimate and store. We propose a low-dimensional rep- resentation, called a scene recipe, that relies on the image itself to de- scribe the complex scene con\ufb01gurations. Shape recipes are an example: these are the regression coef\ufb01cients that predict the bandpassed shape from image data. We describe the bene\ufb01ts of this representation, and show two uses illustrating their properties: (1) we improve stereo shape estimates by learning shape recipes at low resolution and applying them at full resolution; (2) Shape recipes implicitly contain information about lighting and materials and we use them for material segmentation.",

        "abstract": "How do cortical neurons represent the acoustic environment? This ques- tion is often addressed by probing with simple stimuli such as clicks or tone pips. Such stimuli have the advantage of yielding easily interpreted answers, but have the disadvantage that they may fail to uncover complex or higher-order neuronal response properties. Here we adopt an alternative approach, probing neuronal responses with complex acoustic stimuli, including animal vocalizations and music. We have used in vivo whole cell methods in the rat auditory cortex to record subthreshold membrane potential \ufb02uctuations elicited by these stimuli. Whole cell recording reveals the total synaptic input to a neuron from all the other neurons in the circuit, instead of just its output\u2014a sparse bi- nary spike train\u2014as in conventional single unit physiological recordings. Whole cell recording thus provides a much richer source of information about the neuron\u2019s response. Many neurons responded robustly and reliably to the complex stimuli in our ensemble. Here we analyze the linear component\u2014the spectro- temporal receptive \ufb01eld (STRF)\u2014of the transformation from the sound (as represented by its time-varying spectrogram) to the neuron\u2019s mem- brane potential. We \ufb01nd that the STRF has a rich dynamical structure, including excitatory regions positioned in general accord with the predic- tion of the simple tuning curve. We also \ufb01nd that in many cases, much of the neuron\u2019s response, although deterministically related to the stimulus, cannot be predicted by the linear component, indicating the presence of as-yet-uncharacterized nonlinear response properties.",

The focus of this paper is the construction of biologically-motivated kernels for cortical ac- tivities.

We discuss in detail the derivation of Spikernels and describe an ef\ufb01cient al- gorithm for computing their value on any two sequences of neural population spike counts. We demonstrate the merits of our modeling approach using the Spikernel and various standard kernels for the task of predicting hand move- ment velocities from cortical recordings.

The stability measure yields an upper bound to cross-validation in the supervised case, but extends to semi-supervised and unsupervised problems. In the experimental part, the performance of the stability measure is studied for model order se- lection in comparison to standard techniques in this area.",

Constrained minimization of the Bethe free energy can be turned into an unconstrained saddle-point problem. Both converging double-loop algorithms and standard loopy belief propagation can be inter- preted as attempts to solve this saddle-point problem. Stability analysis then leads us to conclude that stable (cid:12)xed points of loopy belief propagation must be (local) minima of the Bethe free energy. Perhaps surprisingly, the converse need not be the case: minima can be unstable (cid:12)xed points. We illustrate this with an example and discuss implications.",

        "abstract": "We describe a probabilistic approach to the task of placing objects, de- scribed by high-dimensional vectors or by pairwise dissimilarities, in a low-dimensional space in a way that preserves neighbor identities. A Gaussian is centered on each object in the high-dimensional space and the densities under this Gaussian (or the given dissimilarities) are used to de\ufb01ne a probability distribution over all the potential neighbors of the object. The aim of the embedding is to approximate this distribu- tion as well as possible when the same operation is performed on the low-dimensional \u201cimages\u201d of the objects. A natural cost function is a sum of Kullback-Leibler divergences, one per object, which leads to a simple gradient for adjusting the positions of the low-dimensional im- ages. Unlike other dimensionality reduction methods, this probabilistic framework makes it easy to represent each object by a mixture of widely separated low-dimensional images. This allows ambiguous objects, like the document count vector for the word \u201cbank\u201d, to have versions close to the images of both \u201criver\u201d and \u201c\ufb01nance\u201d without forcing the images of outdoor concepts to be located close to those of corporate concepts.",

The Fisher  kernel  view  gives  a  more flexible  insight into the string  kernel  and  suggests  how  it  can  be  parametrised  in  a  way  that  re(cid:173) flects  the  statistics  of the training corpus.  Furthermore,  the  prob(cid:173) abilistic  modelling  approach  suggests  extending  the  Markov  pro(cid:173) cess  to  consider  sub-sequences  of varying  length,  rather  than  the  standard fixed-length  approach  used  in  the  string kernel.  We give  a  procedure  for  determining  which  sub-sequences  are  informative  features  and  hence  generate  a  Finite State  Machine  model,  which  can  again  be  used  to  obtain  a  Fisher  kernel.  By  adjusting  the  parametrisation we  can also influence the weighting received by the  features .  In this way we  are able to obtain a  logarithmic weighting  in  a  Fisher  kernel.

The proposed extensions  of the  Support  Vector  Machine  (SVM)  learning  approach lead  to  mixed integer quadratic programs that can be solved  heuristically.  Our generalization of SVMs  makes  a  state-of-the-art classification  technique,  including  non-linear  classification via kernels,  available  to  an  area that  up  to now  has  been  largely  dominated by  special  purpose methods.

The properties are simple-cell-like receptive \ufb01elds and complex-cell-like pooling of simple cell outputs, which emerge when we apply two different approaches to temporal coherence. In the \ufb01rst approach we extract receptive \ufb01elds whose outputs are as temporally co- herent as possible. This approach yields simple-cell-like receptive \ufb01elds (oriented, localized, multiscale). Thus, temporal coherence is an alterna- tive to sparse coding in modeling the emergence of simple cell receptive \ufb01elds. The second approach is based on a two-layer statistical generative model of natural image sequences. In addition to modeling the temporal coherence of individual simple cells, this model includes inter-cell tem- poral dependencies. Estimation of this model from natural data yields both simple-cell-like receptive \ufb01elds, and complex-cell-like pooling of simple cell outputs. In this completely unsupervised learning, both lay- ers of the generative model are estimated simultaneously from scratch. This is a signi\ufb01cant improvement on earlier statistical models of early vision, where only one layer has been learned, and others have been \ufb01xed a priori.",

At singularities, the Fisher information matrix becomes degenerate, resulting that the learning theory of regular statistical models does not hold. Recently, it was proven that, if the true parameter is contained in singularities, then the coe(cid:14)cient of the Bayes gen- eralization error is equal to the pole of the zeta function of the Kullback information. In this paper, under the condition that the true parameter is almost but not contained in singularities, we show two results. (1) If the dimension of the parameter from in- puts to hidden units is not larger than three, then there exits a region of true parameters where the generalization error is larger than those of regular models, however, if otherwise, then for any true parameter, the generalization error is smaller than those of regular models. (2) The symmetry of the generalization error and the training error does not hold in singular models in general.",

The RA scanner is based on a novel laser-based imaging technique which is sensitive to the optical characteristics of \ufb01nger joint tissue. Based on the laser images, \ufb01nger joints are classi\ufb01ed according to whether the in\ufb02ammatory status has improved or worsened. To perform the classi\ufb01cation task, various lin- ear and kernel-based systems were implemented and their performances were compared. Special emphasis was put on measures to reliably per- form parameter tuning and evaluation, since only a very small data set was available. Based on the results presented in this paper, it was con- cluded that the RA scanner permits a reliable classi\ufb01cation of patholog- ical \ufb01nger joints, thus paving the way for a further development from prototype to product stage.",

We argue that these inferences can be explained as Bayesian computations over a hypothesis space of causal graphical models, shaped by strong top-down prior knowledge in the form of intuitive theories. We present two case studies of our approach, including quantitative mod- els of human causal judgments and brief comparisons with traditional bottom-up models of inference.",

We address a problem not convincingly solved in these accounts: how to maintain a representation of cues that predict delayed consequences. Our new model uses a TD rule grounded in partially observable semi-Markov processes, a formalism that captures two largely neglected features of DA experiments: hidden state and temporal variability. Previous models pre- dicted rewards using a tapped delay line representation of sensory inputs; we replace this with a more active process of inference about the under- lying state of the world. The DA system can then learn to map these inferred states to reward predictions using TD. The new model can ex- plain previously vexing data on the responses of DA neurons in the face of temporal variability. By combining statistical model-based learning with a physiologically grounded TD theory, it also brings into contact with physiology some insights about behavior that had previously been con\ufb01ned to more abstract psychological models.",

Furthermore we provide theoretical insight into some of our experimental results. We found that subset of representers methods can give good and particularly fast predictions for data sets with high and medium noise levels.

Under t he assump(cid:173) tion that the data lie on a submanifold in a high dimensional space,  we develop an algorithmic framework to classify a partially labeled  data set in a principled manner . The central idea of our approach is  that classification functions are naturally defined only on t he sub(cid:173) manifold in question rather than the total ambient space. Using the  Laplace Beltrami operator one produces a basis for a Hilbert space  of square integrable functions on the submanifold. To recover such  a basis , only unlab eled examples are required. Once a basis is ob(cid:173) tained , training can be performed using the labeled data set.

It is well-known that given the pairwise mutual information coef\ufb01cients, a minimum-weight spanning tree algorithm solves this problem exactly and in polynomial time. However, for large data-sets it is the construc- tion of the correlation matrix that dominates the running time. We have developed a new spanning-tree algorithm which is capable of exploiting partial knowledge about edge weights. The partial knowledge we main- tain is a probabilistic con\ufb01dence interval on the coef\ufb01cients, which we derive by examining just a small sample of the data. The algorithm is able to \ufb02ag the need to shrink an interval, which translates to inspec- tion of more data for the particular attribute pair. Experimental results show running time that is near-constant in the number of records, with- out signi\ufb01cant loss in accuracy of the generated trees. Interestingly, our spanning-tree algorithm is based solely on Tarjan\u2019s red-edge rule, which is generally considered a guaranteed recipe for bad performance.",

        "abstract": "In recent years variational methods have become a popular tool for approximate inference and learning in a wide variety of proba- bilistic models. For each new application, however, it is currently necessary (cid:12)rst to derive the variational update equations, and then to implement them in application-speci(cid:12)c code. Each of these steps is both time consuming and error prone. In this paper we describe a general purpose inference engine called VIBES (\u2018Variational Infer- ence for Bayesian Networks\u2019) which allows a wide variety of proba- bilistic models to be implemented and solved variationally without recourse to coding. New models are speci(cid:12)ed either through a simple script or via a graphical interface analogous to a drawing package. VIBES then automatically generates and solves the vari- ational equations. We illustrate the power and (cid:13)exibility of VIBES using examples from Bayesian mixture modelling.",

We analyze the impact of compres- sions on decision quality, observing that compressions that allow accurate policy evaluation (prediction of expected future reward) will not affect decision qual- ity. We derive a set of suf\ufb01cient conditions that ensure accurate prediction in this respect, illustrate interesting mathematical properties these confer on lossless lin- ear compressions, and use these to derive an iterative procedure for \ufb01nding good linear lossy compressions. We also elaborate on how structured representations of a POMDP can be used to \ufb01nd such compressions.",

        "abstract": "We consider the hypothesis that systems learning aspects of visual per- ception may bene\ufb01t from the use of suitably designed developmental pro- gressions during training. Four models were trained to estimate motion velocities in sequences of visual images. Three of the models were \u201cde- velopmental models\u201d in the sense that the nature of their input changed during the course of training. They received a relatively impoverished visual input early in training, and the quality of this input improved as training progressed. One model used a coarse-to-multiscale develop- mental progression (i.e. it received coarse-scale motion features early in training and \ufb01ner-scale features were added to its input as training progressed), another model used a \ufb01ne-to-multiscale progression, and the third model used a random progression. The \ufb01nal model was non- developmental in the sense that the nature of its input remained the same throughout the training period. The simulation results show that the coarse-to-multiscale model performed best. Hypotheses are offered to account for this model\u2019s superior performance. We conclude that suit- ably designed developmental sequences can be useful to systems learn- ing to estimate motion velocities. The idea that visual development can aid visual learning is a viable hypothesis in need of further study.",
