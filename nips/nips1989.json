        "abstract": "The phonological structure of human  languages  is  intricate,  yet highly  constrained.  Through  a  combination  of connectionist  modeling  and  linguistic  analysis,  we are attempting to develop a computational basis  for  the  nature  of phonology.  We  present  a  connectionist  architecture  that  performs  multiple  simultaneous  insertion,  deletion,  and  mutation  operations on sequences  of phonemes, and introduce a novel additional  primitive,  clustering.  Clustering  provides  an  interesting  alternative  to  both iterative and relaxation accounts of assimilation processes  such as  vowel  harmony.  Our resulting  model  is  efficient because it processes  utterances entirely in parallel  using  only  feed-forward circuitry.",

The  principal  objective  of  this  modeling effort was to resolve an apparent conflict between a proposed  zonal organization of olivary projections to cerebellar cortex suggested  by  anatomical  tract-tracing  experiments  (Brodal  &  Kawamura  1980;  Campbell & Armstrong  1983) and a more patchy organization apparent  with physiological mapping (Robertson  1987).  The results suggest that  several unique features  of the olivocerebellar circuit may contribute to  the appearance of zonal organization using anatomical  techniques, but  that  the  detailed  patterns  of  patchy  tactile  projections  seen  with  physiological  techniques  are  a  more  accurate  representation  of  the  afferent organization of this region of cortex.",

In [Bourlard &  Wellekens]. it was  shown that  MLPs  were approximating Maximum  a Posteriori (MAP) probabilities  and  could  thus  be  embedded  as  an  emission  probability  estimator  in  HMMs.  By using contextual information from  a sliding window on the  input frames.  we  have  been  able  to  improve  frame  or phoneme  clas(cid:173) sification  performance  over the  corresponding  performance  for Simple  Maximum  Likelihood  (ML)  or even  MAP  probabilities  that  are  esti(cid:173) mated without the benefit of context.  However. recognition of words in  continuous speech was  not so simply improved by the use of an  MLP.  and  several  modifications  of the  original  scheme  were  necessary  for  getting acceptable performance.  It is  shown here that word recognition  performance for a  simple discrete density  HMM  system  appears  to  be  somewhat better when MLP methods are used to estimate the emission  probabilities.",

The distributed-neuron synapses are ar(cid:173) ranged in blocks of 16, which we call '4  x  4 tiles'.  Switch matrices  are  interleaved between each of these  tiles  to provide programma(cid:173) bility of interconnections.

Some of the possible configurations are, a  12-32-12  network,  a  16-12-12-16  network, two 12-32  networks etc.  (the numbers sep(cid:173) arated  by dashes indicate the number of units per layer, including  the  input  layer).  Weights  are  stored  in  analog  form  on  MaS  ca(cid:173) pacitors.  The synaptic weights  are  usable to a  resolution  of 1 % of  their full  scale  value.  The limitation arises  due  to charge injection  from  the access  switch and  charge leakage.  Other  parameters like  gain and shape of nonlinearity are also programmable.",

The  time  separation  of echo  components from  parts of the target located at  different  distances  is  reconstructed  from  the  echo  spectrum  and  added  to  the  estimate  of absolute  delay  already  derived  from  the  arrival-time  of  echoes.

Fusion  of  physiologically  distinct  time- and  frequency-domain  representations  into  a  fmal,  common  time-domain  image  illustrates  the  binding  of  within(cid:173) modality  features  into  a  unified,  whole  image.

The primary pathways of this sys(cid:173) tem are feed-forward,  with inputs from  the semicircular canals and  outputs  to  the  oculomotor system.  Since  visual  feedback  is  not  used  directly  in  the  VOR  computation,  the  system  must  exploit  motor learning to perform correctly.  Lisberger(1988) has proposed  a  model for  adapting the  VOR gain  using  image-slip  information  from  the  retina.  We  have  designed  and  tested  analog  very  large(cid:173) scale integrated (VLSI) circuitry that implements a  simplified ver(cid:173) sion of Lisberger's adaptive VOR model.",

The network  has  explicit  excitatory  neurons  with  local  inhibitory  interneuron  feedback  that forms  a  set of nonlinear oscillators coupled  only by  long range excitatofy connections.  Using a local Hebb-like learning  rule for  primary and higher order synapses  at the ends of the long  range  connections,  the  system  learns  to store  the  kinds  of oscil(cid:173) lation amplitude patterns observed  in olfactory  and  visual  cortex.  This  rule  is  derived  from  a  more  general  \"projection  algorithm\"  for recurrent  analog networks, that analytically guarantees content  addressable  memory  storage  of continuous  periodic  sequences  - capacity:  N /2  Fourier  components for  an  N  node  network  - \"spurious\"  attractors.",

The fIrst method is  based  on  treating  the  regular  grammar as  a  I-dimensional  Markov  source, and the second is based on the combinatoric characteristics of  the regular grammar itself.

We  test  a  biologically  plausible,  Hebbian,  single-neuron  model,  which learns oriented receptive fields  upon exposure  to un(cid:173) structured (noise) input and maintains orientation selectivity upon  exposure  to  edges  or  bars  of all  orientations  and  positions.  This  model  can  also  learn  arc-shaped  receptive  fields  upon  exposure  to an environment of only  circular  rings.  Thus,  new  experiments  which try to induce an abnormal (curved) receptive field  may pro(cid:173) vide insight into the plasticity of simple cells.  The model suggests  that exposing  cells  to only  a  single  spatial  frequency  may induce  more  striking spatial frequency  and  orientation  dependent effects  than heretofore observed.",

Using  these  models  we  have  examined  the  dependence of oscillatory behavior on single cell properties and net(cid:173) work  architectures.

Because  the  amount  of hardware  in  a  neural  network  typically  increases  with  the  dimensionality  of  its  inputs,  it  can be challenging to build a high-performance network for classifying  large input patterns.

The robot's task is to con(cid:173) struct an internal model of its environment. a model that will allow it to predict  the consequences of its actions  and to determine what sequences of actions  to  take  to  reach  particular  goal  states.  Rivest  and  Schapire  (1987&,  1987b;  Schapire.  1988) have studied this problem and have designed a symbolic algo(cid:173) rithm  to  strategically explore  and infer the  structure of \"finite state\"  environ(cid:173) ments.  The heart of this algorithm is a clever representation of the environment  called an update graph.  We have developed a connectionist implementation of  the update  graph using  a highly-specialized network  architecture.

The network has  the  additional  strength  that it  can accommodate stochastic environments.

        "abstract": "In  associative reinforcement learning,  an environment generates input  vectors, a  learning system generates possible output vectors, and a  re(cid:173) inforcement function computes feedback signals from the input-output  pairs.  The  task is  to discover  and  remember  input-output  pairs  that  generate  rewards.  Especially  difficult  cases  occur  when  rewards  are  rare, since the expected time for any algorithm can grow exponentially  with the size  of the problem.  Nonetheless, if a  reinforcement function  possesses regularities, and a learning algorithm exploits them, learning  time  can be reduced  below that  of non-generalizing  algorithms.  This  paper  describes  a  neural  network algorithm called  complementary  re(cid:173) inforcement  back-propagation (CRBP),  and  reports simulation results  on problems designed to offer differing opportunities for generalization.",

On  a  small  vocabulary  task,  Radial  Basis  Function  (RBF)  and  back-propagation  neural  nets  reduced  the  error  rate  substantially (from 7.9% to 4.2% for the RBF classifier).  In a larger  vocabulary task, neural net classifiers did not reduce the error rate.  They, however,  outperformed Gaussian, Gaussian mixture, and k(cid:173) nearest  neighbor  (KNN)  classifiers.  In  another  approach,  neural  nets  functioned  as  low-level  acoustic-phonetic  feature  extractors.  When  classifying  phonemes  based on single  10  msec.  frames,  dis(cid:173) criminant  RBF  neural  net  classifiers outperformed  Gaussian mix(cid:173) ture  classifiers.

        "abstract": "A  central  problem  in  connectionist  modelling  is  the  control  of  network  and  architectural  resources  during  learning.  In  the  present  approach,  weights  reflect  a  coarse  prediction  history  as  coded  by  a  distribution  of  values  and  parameterized  in  the  mean  and  standard  deviation  of  these  weight  distributions.  Weight  updates  are  a  function  of  both  the  mean  and  standard  deviation  of  each  connection  in  the  network and vary  as  a  function  of  the  error signal  (\"stochastic  delta  rule\";  Hanson,  1990).  Consequently,  the  weights  their  maintain  in  \"uncertainty\"  establishing  a  policy  concerning  the  size  of  the  nodal  complexity  of  the  network  and  growth  of  new  nodes.  For  example,  during  problem  solving  the  present  network  can  undergo  \"meiosis\",  producing  two  nodes  where  there  was  one  \"overtaxed\"  node  as  measured  by  its  coefficient of variation.  It  is  shown  in  a  number of  benchmark  problems  that  meiosis  networks  can  find  minimal  architectures,  reduce  computational complexity,  and overall  increase  the efficiency of the representation learning interaction.",

        "abstract": "Interneurons in leech ganglia receive multiple sensory inputs and make  synaptic contacts with many motor neurons. These \"hidden\" units  coordinate several different behaviors. We used physiological and  anatomical constraints to construct a model of the local bending reflex.  Dynamical networks were trained on experimentally derived input-output  patterns using recurrent back-propagation. Units in the model were  modified to include electrical synapses and multiple synaptic time  constants. The properties of the hidden units that emerged in the  simulations matched those in the leech. The model and data support  distributed rather than localist representations in the local bending reflex.  These results also explain counterintuitive aspects of the local bending  circuitry.",

        "abstract": "The existence of modularity in the organization of nervous systems  (e.g. cortical columns and olfactory glomeruli) is well known. We  show that localized activity patterns in a layer of cells, collective  excitations, can induce the formation of modular structures in the  anatomical connections via a Hebbian learning mechanism. The  networks are spatially homogeneous before learning, but the spon(cid:173) taneous emergence of localized collective excitations and subse(cid:173) quently modularity in the connection patterns breaks translational  symmetry. This spontaneous symmetry breaking phenomenon is  similar to those which drive pattern formation in reaction-diffusion  systems. We have identified requirements on the patterns of lateral  connections and on the gains of internal units which are essential  for the development of modularity. These essential requirements  will most likely remain operative when more complicated (and bi(cid:173) ologically realistic) models are considered.",

We report on results of  training nets with samples of hand-printed digits scanned off of bank checks  and hand-printed letters interactively entered into a computer through a sty(cid:173) lus digitizer.  Given a large training set,  and a net with sufficient capacity to  achieve  high performance on the training set,  nets  typically achieved error  rates of 4-5% at a 0% reject rate and 1-2% at a 10% reject rate.  The topology  and capacity of the system, as measured by the number of connections in the  net,  have  surprisingly little effect on generalization.  For those  developing  practical pattern recognition systems,  these results suggest that a large and  representative  training  sample  may be  the single,  most important factor in  achieving high recognition accuracy.  From a scientific standpoint, these re(cid:173) sults raise doubts about the relevance to backpropagation of learning models  that estimate the likelihood of high generalization from estimates of capacity.  Reducing capacity does have other benefits however, especially when the re(cid:173) duction is  accomplished by using local receptive fields  with shared weights.  In this latter case, we find the net evolves feature detectors resembling those  in visual cortex and Linsker's orientation-selective nodes.",

Whereas many algo(cid:173) rithms  reduce  the  learning  process  to  minimizing a  cost  function  over the  weights, our method treats the  internal representations as  the fundamental entities to  be determined.  The algorithm applies  a  search  procedure  in the  space  of internal representations,  and  a  cooperative adaptation of the weights (e.g.  by using the perceptron  learning rule).  Since the introduction of its basic, single output ver(cid:173) sion, the CHIR algorithm was generalized to train any feed  forward  network of binary neurons.  Here we present the generalised version  of the  CHIR algorithm,  and further  demonstrate  its  versatility by  describing  how it can  be  modified  in order  to  train networks with  binary  (\u00b11)  weights.  Preliminary  tests  of this  binary  version  on  the random teacher  problem are  also  reported.",

Instead of just adjusting the weights  in a network of fixed topology. Cascade-Correlation begins with a min(cid:173) imal network,  then automatically trains  and adds new hidden  units  one  by  one,  creating a  multi-layer structure.  Once  a  new  hidden  unit  has  been added  to the network, its  input-side weights are frozen.  This  unit  then becomes a permanent feature-detector in the network, available for  producing  outputs  or for  creating other,  more complex  feature  detec(cid:173) tors.  The Cascade-Correlation architecture has  several advantages over  existing algorithms:  it  learns  very quickly,  the network . determines  its  own size and  topology, it retains  the structures  it  has  built even  if the  training set changes, and it requires no back-propagation of error signals  through  the connections of the network.",

Examples  include  an  HMM-based  word discriminator,  which  we  call an 'Alphanet'.",

Steinbuch and Taylor presented neural network designs to  do nearest  neighbor lookup in the early 1960s.  In  this  paper their  nearest neighbor network is augmented with a local model network,  which fits  a local model to a set of nearest neighbors.  The network  design  is  equivalent to local  regression.  This  network  architecture  can  represent  smooth  nonlinear functions,  yet  has  simple  training  rules  with  a  single  global  optimum.  The  network  has  been  used  for  motor  learning  of  a  simulated  arm  and  a  simulated  running  machine.",

The input to such a network must  be translation-invariant. since the distinctive features of the EeG may  appear anywhere in an arbritrarily-chosen EeG segment.
