        "abstract": "A  new  boundary  hunting  radial  basis  function  (BH-RBF)  classifier  which  allocates  RBF  centers  constructively  near  class  boundaries  is  described.  This  classifier creates complex  decision  boundaries  only  in  regions  where  confusions  occur  and  corresponding  RBF  outputs  are  similar.  A  predicted  square  error  measure  is  used  to  determine  how  many centers to add and to determine when to stop adding centers. Two  experiments are presented which demonstrate the advantages of the BH(cid:173) RBF classifier.  One uses artificial data with  two classes and  two  input  features  where each class contains  four clusters but only  one cluster is  near a decision region boundary. The other uses a large seismic database  with  seven  classes and  14  input features.  In  both  experiments  the  BH(cid:173) RBF classifier provides a lower error rate  with  fewer  centers  than  are  required  by  more  conventional  RBF,  Gaussian  mixture,  or  MLP  classifiers.",

One problem of this  approach is that there is no direct correspondence between error proba(cid:173) bility and residual error produced by the channel inversion operation. In  this paper, the optimal equalizer design is formulated as a classification  problem. The optimal classifier can be constructed by Bayes decision  rule. In general it is nonlinear.

This requires extensive, time consuming calculations for each pat(cid:173) tern presentation and high precision that makes it difficult to implement  in VLSI. We present here a perturbation technique that measures, not  calculates, the gradient. Since the technique uses the actual network as  a measuring device, errors in modeling neuron activation and synaptic  weights do not cause errors in gradient descent. The method is parallel  in nature and easy to implement in VLSI. We describe the theory of such  an algorithm, an analysis of its domain of applicability, some simulations  using it and an outline of a hardware implementation.",

By gradually varying the  parameter, practice movements remain near the desired path while  a  Neural Network learns to approximate the inverse dynamics.

The  hippocampal region is presumed to form new stimulus representations which facilitate  learning by enhancing the discriminability of predictive stimuli and compressing  stimulus-stimulus redundancies. The cortical and cerebellar regions, which are the sites  of long-term memory. may acquire these new representations but are not assumed to be  capable of forming new representations themselves.  Instantiated as a connectionist  model. this theory accounts for a wide range of trial-level classical conditioning  phenomena in normal (intact) and hippocampal-Iesioned animals. It also makes several  novel predictions which remain to be investigated empirically. The theory implies that  the hippocampal region is involved in even the simplest learning tasks; although  hippocampal-Iesioned animals may be able to use other strategies to learn these tasks. the  theory predicts that they will show consistently different patterns of transfer and  generalization when the task demands change.",

In this paper we show that even high-order polynomial  classifiers in high dimensional spaces can be trained with a small amount  of training data and yet generalize better than classifiers with a smaller  VC-dimension. This is achieved with a maximum margin algorithm (the  Generalized Portrait). The technique is applicable to a wide variety of  classifiers, including Perceptrons, polynomial classifiers (sigma-pi unit net(cid:173) works) and Radial Basis Functions. The effective number of parameters is  adjusted automatically by the training algorithm to match the complexity  of the problem. It is shown to equal the number of those training patterns  which are closest patterns to the decision boundary (supporting patterns).  Bounds on the generalization error and the speed of convergence of the al(cid:173) gorithm are given. Experimental results on handwritten digit recognition  demonstrate good generalization compared to other algorithms.",

We employ results from harmonic analysis and the theory of rational ap(cid:173) proximation to obtain almost tight lower bounds on the size (i.e. number  of elements) of neural networks. The class of neural networks to which  our techniques can be applied is quite general; it includes any feedforward  network in which each element can be piecewise approximated by a low  degree rational function. For example, we prove that any depth-( d + 1)  network of sigmoidal units or linear threshold elements computing the par(cid:173) ity function of n variables must have O(dnl/d-\u00a3) size, for any fixed i > O.  In addition, we prove that this lower bound is almost tight by showing  that the parity function can be computed with O(dnl/d) sigmoidal units  or linear threshold elements in a depth-(d + 1) network. These almost  tight bounds are the first known complexity results on the size of neural  networks with depth more than two. Our lower bound techniques yield  a unified approach to the complexity analysis of various models of neural  networks with feedforward structures.

Using stochastic approximation results, we show that for  TJ ~ 0 this training process approaches a batch training and pro(cid:173) vide results on the rate of convergence. Further, we show that for  small TJ one can approximate simple back propagation by the sum  of a batch training process and a Gaussian diffusion which is the  unique solution to a linear stochastic differential equation. Using  this approximation we indicate the reasons why simple backprop(cid:173) agation is less likely to get stuck in local minima than the batch  training process and demonstrate this empirically on a number of  examples.",

This formulation is  an extension of the Boltzmann  machine in which  the units are  not  binary, but take on values in a  cyclic  range,  between  0  and 271'  radians.  The state of each  unit  in  a  Directional-Unit  Boltzmann  Machine  (DUBM)  is  described  by  a  complex variable, where  the phase component specifies  a direction;  the  weights  are  also  complex variables.  We  associate  a  quadratic  energy  function,  and  corresponding  probability,  with  each  DUBM  configuration.  The  conditional  distribution  of a  unit's  stochastic  state is  a  circular  version of the Gaussian probability distribution,  known  as  the  von  Mises  distribution.  In  a  mean-field  approxima(cid:173) tion  to  a  stochastic  DUBM,  the  phase  component of a  unit's state  represents  its mean direction,  and the magnitude component spec(cid:173) ifies  the  degree  of certainty  associated  with  this  direction.  This  combination of a  value  and  a  certainty  provides  additional  repre(cid:173) sentational power  in a  unit.

In order  to generalize successfully, neural network learning methods typically require  large training data sets. We introduce a neural network learning method that  generalizes rationally from many fewer data points, relying instead on prior  knowledge encoded in previously learned neural networks. For example, in robot  control learning tasks reported here, previously learned networks that model the  effects of robot actions are used to guide subsequent learning of robot control  functions. For each observed training example of the target function (e.g. the  robot control policy), the learner explains the observed example in terms of its  prior knowledge, then analyzes this explanation to infer additional information  about the shape, or slope, of the target function. This shape knowledge is used  to bias generalization when learning the target function. Results are presented  applying this approach to a simulated robot task based on reinforcement learning.",

We present  a  model of how  MT cells  aggregate  responses  from  VI  to  form  such  a  velocity  representation.  Two  different  sets  of units,  with  local  receptive  fields,  receive  inputs  from motion energy filters.  One set of units forms estimates of local  motion, while the second set computes the utility of these estimates.  Outputs from  this second set  of units  \"gate\"  the outputs from  the  first  set  through  a  gain  control  mechanism.  This  active  process  for  selecting  only  a  subset  of local  motion  responses  to  integrate  into more global  responses  distinguishes  our  model from  previous  models of velocity estimation.  The model yields  accurate  velocity  estimates  in  synthetic  images  containing multiple moving  targets  of varying size,  luminance,  and spatial frequency  profile and  deals  well  with a  number of transparency  phenomena.",

Projection  pursuit  regression  representations  and  the  ability  of algorithms like SIR to quickly  find  reasonable weighting vectors  enable us  to confront the vexing architecture selection problem  by  reducing  high-dimensional  gradient  searchs  to  fitting  single-input  single-output  (SISO)  subnets.  We  introduce  dimension  reduction  algorithms,  to select  features  or  relevant  subsets of a  set  of many  variables,  based  on  minimizing  an  index  of level-set  dispersions  (closely  related  to  a  projection  index  and  to  SIR),  and  combine  them  with  backfitting  to  implement  a  neural  network  version  of  projection  pursuit.

There are two fundamentally different issues which result in the need  for  some  form  of regularization;  the  existence  of multiple  solution branches  (global ill-posedness) and the existence of excess degrees of freedom (local ill(cid:173) posedness).  For certain  classes  of manipulators,  learning  methods  applied  to  input-output data generated from  the forward function can  be used  to globally  regularize the problem by partitioning the domain of the forward mapping into  a  finite  set  of regions  over which  the  inverse  problem  is  well-posed.  Local  regularization  can  be accomplished  by  an  appropriate parameterization  of the  redundancy consistently over each region.  As a result, the ill-posed problem can  be transformed into a finite set of well-posed problems. Each can then be solved  separately to construct approximate direct inverse functions.",

The induction process starts  with the most specific model consistent with the training data and generalizes  by successively merging states. Both the choice of states to merge and the  stopping criterion are guided by the Bayesian posterior probability. We compare  our algorithm with the Baum-Welch method of estimating fixed-size models, and  find that it can induce minimal HMMs from data in cases where fixed estimation  does not converge or requires redundant parameters to converge.",

We introduce a new convergent  learning algorithm for HMMs that, unlike the classical Baum-Welch  algorithm is smooth and can be applied  on-line or in  batch mode,  with or  without the usual Viterbi most  likely  path approximation.  Left-right HMMs with insertion and deletion states are then trained  to represent several protein families including immunoglobulins and  kinases.  In  all cases,  the models derived capture all  the important  statistical  properties  of the families  and  can  be  used  efficiently  in  a  number of important tasks such as multiple alignment, motif de(cid:173) tection,  and  classification.",

Using  the  Bayesian  ap(cid:173) proach,  we find  that performance is improved when a history-based  term is included in the neuron's dynamics.

The contribution of biologically plausible,  censored,  history(cid:173) dependent dynamics is especially marked in conditions of low firing  activity  and  sparse  connectivity,  two  important  characteristics  of  the  mammalian  cortex.

We describe the dynamics of these phenomena in two paral(cid:173) lel approaches, a phenomenological and a rather microscopic one. On the  one hand we analyze neuronal responses in terms of a hidden state model  (HSM). The parameters of this model are extracted directly from exper(cid:173) imental spike trains. They characterize the underlying dynamics as well  as the coupling of individual neurons to the network. This phenomenolog(cid:173) ical model thus provides a new framework for the experimental analysis  of network dynamics. The application of this method to multi unit ac(cid:173) tivities from the visual cortex of the cat substantiates the existence of  oscillatory and stochastic states and quantifies the switching behaviour  in the assembly dynamics. On the other hand we start from the single  spiking neuron and derive a master equation for the time evolution of the  assembly state which we represent by a phase density. This phase density  dynamics (PDD) exhibits costability of two attractors, a limit cycle, and  a fixed point when synaptic interaction is nonlinear. External fluctuations  can switch the bistable system from one state to the other. Finally we  show, that the two approaches are mutually consistent and therefore both  explain the detailed time structure in the data.",

However, the  algorithm discussed here depends on having a large supply of  independent training samples. We show how to circumvent this  problem and generate an ensemble of learning machines whose  performance in optical character recognition problems is dramatically  improved over that of a single network. We report the effect of  boosting on four databases (all handwritten) consisting of 12,000 digits  from segmented ZIP codes from the United State Postal Service  (USPS) and the following from the National Institute of Standards and  Testing (NIST): 220,000 digits, 45,000 upper case alphas, and 45,000  lower case alphas. We use two performance measures: the raw error  rate (no rejects) and the reject rate required to achieve a 1% error rate  on the patterns not rejected. Boosting improved performance in some  cases by a factor of three.",

The technique uses a network's ability to accurately encode  the input pattern in its internal representation as a measure of its reliability. The  more accurately a network is able to reconstruct the input pattern from its internal  representation, the more reliable the network is considered to be. IRRE is provides  a good estimate of the reliability of MLPs trained for autonomous driving. Results  are presented in which the reliability estimates provided by IRRE are used to select  between networks trained for different driving situations.",

ONTOL is a grammar for gener(cid:173) ating polynomial NN ets for time-series prediction. Genomes corre(cid:173) spond to an ordered sequence of ONTOL productions and define a  grammar that is expressed to generate a NNet.

We extend the  analysis of the spatial structure of hidden unit space to a combinatorial task,  based on binding features together in a visual scene. The logical structure  requires a combinatorial number of states to represent all valid scenes. On  analysing our networks, we find that the high dimensionality of hidden unit  space is exploited by using the intersection of neighboring regions to represent  conjunctions of features. These results show how combinatorial structure can  be based on the spatial nature of networks, and not just on their emulation of  logical structure.",

Since the new units mod(cid:173) ify the weights at the next time-step with information from the  previous step, temporal tasks can be learned without the use of  feedback, thereby greatly simplifying training. Furthermore, a the(cid:173) oretically unlimited number of units can be added to reach into  the arbitrarily distant past.

Several  \"encoder\" experiments have shown that when the representation space is  small it can be fully used. But computing with such a representation  requires completely dependable nodes. In the case where the hidden  nodes are noisy and unreliable, we find that error correcting schemes  emerge simply by using noisy units during training; random errors in(cid:173) jected during backpropagation result in spreading representations apart.  Average and minimum distances increase with misfire probability, as  predicted by coding-theoretic considerations. Furthennore, the effect of  this noise is to protect the machine against permanent node failure,  thereby potentially extending the useful lifetime of the machine.",

Theorem  1  gives  the asymptotic form for  the jackknife estimator.  Combined with the  model selection  criterion,  this asymptotic form  can  be  used  to obtain the  fit  of a  model.  The model selection  criterion we  used  is the negative of the  average predictive likehood, the choice of which is  based on the idea of the  cross-validation  method.  Lemma 1  provides  a  formula  for  further  explo(cid:173) ration of the asymptotics of the model selection criterion.

The  objective of this effort is to develop an  adaptive Neural Network (NN)  controller for the Ball C-Side 1m x 3m antenna with embedded actuators  and the RAMS  sensor system.  A traditional  optimal controller for  the  major modes  is provided perturbations  by  the  NN  to compensate  for  unknown residual modes. On-line training of recurrent and feed-forward  NN  architectures  have  achieved  adaptive  vibration  control  with  unknown  modal  variations and  noisy  measurements.  On-line training  feedback to each actuator NN output is computed via Newton's method  to reduce the difference between desired and achieved antenna positions.",

One circuit,  implementing the dynamic wires model, provides for dedicated lines  of communication  among  groups  of pixels  that  share  a  common  property.  The chip  uses  the  dynamic wires  model to  compute the  arclength of visual contours.  Another circuit labels all points inside  a  given  contour  with one  voltage  and  all other  with  another  volt(cid:173) age.  Its behavior is  very  robust,  since small breaks in  contours are  automatically sealed,  providing  for  Figure-Ground segregation  in  a  noisy  environment.  Both  chips  are implemented using  networks  of resistors  and switches  and  represent  a  step  towards object  level  processing  since  a  single  voltage value encodes  the property  of an  ensemble of pixels.",

This paper shows that for neural nets it is far easier to use the exact result  than  it is  to use  the evidence approximation. Moreover,  unlike  the evi(cid:173) dence approximation, the exact result neither has to be re-calculated for  every new data set, nor requires the running of computer code (the exact  result is  closed  form).  In  addition, it turns out that the evidence proce(cid:173) dure's MAP estimate for neural nets is, in toto, approximation error. An(cid:173) other advantage of the exact analysis is that it does not lead one to incor(cid:173) rect intuition, like the claim that using evidence one can \"evaluate differ(cid:173) ent  priors  in  light of the  data\".

        "abstract": "An artificial neural network (ANN) is commonly modeled by a threshold  circuit, a network of interconnected processing units called linear threshold  gates. The depth of a network represents the number of unit delays or the  time for parallel computation. The SIze of a circuit is the number of gates  and measures the amount of hardware . It was known that traditional logic  circuits consisting of only unbounded fan-in AND, OR, NOT gates would  require at least O(log n/log log n) depth to compute common arithmetic  functions such as the product or the quotient of two n-bit numbers, unless  we allow the size (and fan-in) to increase exponentially (in n). We show in  this paper that ANNs can be much more powerful than traditional logic  circuits. In particular, we prove that that iterated addition can be com(cid:173) puted by depth-2 ANN, and multiplication and division can be computed  by depth-3 ANNs with polynomial size and polynomially bounded integer  weights, respectively. Moreover, it follows from known lower bound re(cid:173) sults that these ANNs are optimal in depth. We also indicate that these  techniques can be applied to construct polynomial-size depth-3 ANN for  powering, and depth-4 ANN for mUltiple product.",

Linsker concentrates on the vi(cid:173) sual processing system, but infers that the weak assumptions made  will allow the model to be used in the processing of other sensory  information. This claim is examined here, with special attention  paid to the auditory system, where there is much lower connec(cid:173) tivity and therefore more statistical variability. On-line training is  utilised, to obtain an idea of training times. These are then com(cid:173) pared to the time available to pre-natal mammals for the formation  of feature sensitive cells.",

In this paper an imple(cid:173) mented neural network model is described that attempts to specify  how selective visual attention, perceptual organisation, and invari(cid:173) ance transformations might work together in order to segment, select,  and recognize objects out of complex input scenes containing multi(cid:173) ple, possibly overlapping objects. Retinotopically organized feature  maps serve as input for two main processing routes:  pathway' dealing with location information and the 'what-pathway'  computing the shape and attributes of objects. A location-based at(cid:173) tention mechanism operates on an early stage of visual processing  selecting a contigous region of the visual field for preferential proces(cid:173) sing. Additionally, location-based attention plays an important role  for invariant object recognition controling appropriate normalization  processes within the what-pathway. Object recognition is supported  through the segmentation of the visual field into distinct entities. In  order to represent different segmented entities at the same time, the  model uses an oscillatory binding mechanism. Connections between  the where-pathway and the what-pathway lead to a flexible coope(cid:173) ration between different functional subsystems producing an overall  behavior which is consistent with a variety of psychophysical data.",

One  of  the  most  promising  areas  of  application  for  these  algo(cid:173) rithms  is  the  control  of dynamical  systems,  and  some  impressive  results  have  been  achieved.  However,  there  are  significant  gaps  between  practice  and  theory.  In  particular,  there  are  no  con ver(cid:173) gence  proofs for  problems with continuous state and action  spaces,  or  for  systems  involving  non-linear  function  approximators  (such  as  multilayer  perceptrons).  This  paper  presents  research  applying  DP-based  reinforcement  learning  theory  to Linear  Quadratic  Reg(cid:173) ulation  (LQR),  an  important  class  of control  problems  involving  continuous  state  and  action  spaces  and  requiring  a  simple  type of  non-linear function  approximator.  We describe  an algorithm based  on  Q-Iearning  that is  proven  to converge  to the optimal  controller  for  a  large  class  of  LQR  problems.  We  also  describe  a  slightly  different  algorithm  that  is  only  locally  convergent  to  the  optimal  Q-function,  demonstrating  one  of the  possible  pitfalls  of using  a  non-linear  function  approximator  with  DP-based  learning.",

Our method, Optimal Brain Surgeon (OBS), is Significantly better than  magnitude-based methods and Optimal Brain Damage [Le Cun, Denker and Sol1a, 1990],  which often remove the wrong weights. OBS permits the pruning of more weights than  other methods (for the same error on the training set), and thus yields better  generalization on test data. Crucial to OBS is a recursion relation for calculating the  inverse Hessian matrix H-I from training data and structural information of the net. OBS  permits a 90%, a 76%, and a 62% reduction in weights over backpropagation with weighL  decay on three benchmark MONK's problems [Thrun et aI., 1991]. Of OBS, Optimal  Brain Damage, and magnitude-based methods, only OBS deletes the correct weights from  a trained XOR network in every case. Finally, whereas Sejnowski and Rosenberg [1987J  used 18,000 weights in their NETtalk network, we used OBS to prune a network to just  1560 weights, yielding better generalization.",

However  the  available  information  is  usually  sufficient  to  highly  constrain  the  outputs.  We  discuss  Bayesian  techniques  for  extracting  class probabilities given partial data. The optimal solution involves inte(cid:173) grating  over the  missing dimensions  weighted  by  the  local  probability  densities.  We  show  how  to  obtain  closed-form  approximations  to  the  Bayesian  solution  using  Gaussian  basis function  networks.  The frame(cid:173) work  extends  naturally  to  the case of noisy  features.  Simulations on a  complex task (3D  hand gesture recognition)  validate the  theory.  When  both integration and weighting by input densities are used, performance  decreases gracefully with the number of missing or noisy features.

We propose  to model such data using a multivariate Poisson Hidden Markov  Model. We demonstrate the application of this approach for tem(cid:173) poral segmentation of the firing patterns, and for characterization  of the cortical responses to external stimuli. Using such a statisti(cid:173) cal model we can significantly discriminate two behavioral modes  of the monkey, and characterize them by the different firing pat(cid:173) terns, as well as by the level of coherency of their multi-unit firing  activity.

        "abstract": "We have designed an architecture to span the gap between bio(cid:173) physics and cognitive science to address and explore issues of how  a discrete symbol processing system can arise from the continuum,  and how complex dynamics like oscillation and synchronization can  then be employed in its operation and affect its learning. We show  how a discrete-time recurrent \"Elman\" network architecture can  be constructed from recurrently connected oscillatory associative  memory modules described by continuous nonlinear ordinary dif(cid:173) ferential equations. The modules can learn connection weights be(cid:173) tween themselves which will cause the system to evolve under a  clocked \"machine cycle\" by a sequence of transitions of attractors  within the modules, much as a digital computer evolves by transi(cid:173) tions of its binary flip-flop attractors. The architecture thus em(cid:173) ploys the principle of \"computing with attractors\" used by macro(cid:173) scopic systems for reliable computation in the presence of noise. We  have specifically constructed a system which functions as a finite  state automaton that recognizes or generates the infinite set of six  symbol strings that are defined by a Reber grammar. It is a symbol  processing system, but with analog input and oscillatory subsym(cid:173) bolic representations. The time steps (machine cycles) of the sys(cid:173) tem are implemented by rhythmic variation (clocking) of a bifurca(cid:173) tion parameter. This holds input and \"context\" modules clamped  at their attractors while 'hidden and output modules change state,  then clamps hidden and output states while context modules are  released to load those states as the new context for the next cycle of  input. Superior noise immunity has been demonstrated for systems  with dynamic attractors over systems with static attractors, and  synchronization (\"binding\") between coupled oscillatory attractors  in different modules has been shown to be important for effecting  reliable transitions.",

An important aspect of this model is that ocular domi- \nnance segregation can occur when input activity is both distributed, and \npositively correlated between the eyes. This allows investigation of the \ndependence of the pattern of ocular dominance stripes on the degree of \ncorrelation between the eyes: it is found that increasing correlation leads \nto narrower stripes.

For example, a moving stimulus appears smeared  when viewed briefly (30 ms), yet sharp when viewed for a longer  exposure (100 ms) (Burr, 1980). This suggests that visual systems  combine information along a trajectory that matches the motion of  the stimulus. Our self-organizing neural network model shows how  developmental exposure to moving stimuli can direct the formation of  horizontal trajectory-specific motion integration pathways that unsmear  representations of moving stimuli. These results account for Burr's data  and can potentially also model ot.her phenomena, such as visual inertia.",

        "abstract": "A model of the hippocampus as a central element in rat naviga(cid:173) tion is presented. Simulations show both the behaviour of single  cells and the resultant navigation of the rat. These are compared  with single unit recordings and behavioural data. The firing of  CAl place cells is simulated as the (artificial) rat moves in an en(cid:173) vironment. This is the input for a neuronal network whose output,  at each theta (0) cycle, is the next direction of travel for the rat.  Cells are characterised by the number of spikes fired and the time  of firing with respect to hippocampal 0 rhythm. 'Learning' occurs  in 'on-off' synapses that are switched on by simultaneous pre- and  post-synaptic activity. The simulated rat navigates successfully to  goals encountered one or more times during exploration in open  fields. One minute of random exploration of a 1m2 environment  allows navigation to a newly-presented goal from novel starting po(cid:173) sitions. A limited number of obstacles can be successfully avoided.",

Pulses  of variable width, rather than graded potentials, represent  a  natural  medium  for  evaluating temporal relationships.

We summarize the theory of the time evolution of P, and  give  graphical  examples  of  the  time  evolution  that  contrast  the  behavior  of stochastic learning  with  true gradient  descent  (batch  learning).  Finally, we use the formalism to obtain predictions of the  time required for noise-induced hopping between basins of different  optima.
