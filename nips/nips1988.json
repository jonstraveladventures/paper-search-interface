The  algorithm  can automati(cid:173) cally  find  optimal  or  nearly  optimal  architectures  necessary  to  solve  known  Boolean  functions,  facilitate  the  interpretation  of  the  activation  of  the  remaining  hidden  units  and  automatically  estimate the complexity of architectures appropriate for phonetic  labeling  problems.  The  general  principle  of the  algorithm  can  also be adapted to different tasks:  for  example,  it can be used to  eliminate the  [0,  0]  local minimum  of the  [-1.  +1]  logistic  acti(cid:173) vation  function  while  preserving  a  much  faster  convergence  and  forcing  binary  activations  over the  set of hidden  units.",

        "abstract": "A  new  learning  algorithm  for  the  storage  of  static  and  periodic  attractors  in  biologically  inspired  recurrent  analog  neural  networks  is  introduced.  For  a  network  of  n  nodes,  n  static  or  n/2  periodic  attractors  may  be  stored.  The  algorithm  allows  programming  of  the  network  vector  field  indepen(cid:173) dent  of  the  patterns  to  be  stored.  Stability  of  patterns,  basin  geometry,  and  rates  of  convergence  may  be  controlled.  For  orthonormal  patterns,  the  l~grning operation  reduces  to  a  kind  of  periodic  outer  product  rule  that  allows  local,  additive,  commutative,  incremental  learning.  Standing  or  traveling  wave  cycles  may  be  stored  to  mimic  the  kind  of  oscillating  spatial  patterns  that  appear  in  the  neural  activity  of  the  olfactory  bulb  and  prepyriform  cortex  during  inspiration  and  suffice,  in  the  bulb,  to  predict  the  pattern  recognition  behavior  of  rabbits  in  classical  conditioning  ex(cid:173) periments.  These  attractors  arise,  during  simulat(cid:173) ed  inspiration,  through  a  multiple  Hopf  bifurca(cid:173) tion,  which  can  act  as  a  critical  \"decision  pOint\"  for  their  selection  by  a  very  small  input  pattern.",

Simulation  of the  model  shows that it retains four signal processing features whose importance  we argue on the basis of engineering logic and evolutionary evidence.  Furthermore, just as  the cochlea does,  the  model  achieves  massively  parallel signal processing in a structurally economic way, by means of  shared elements.  By extracting what we believe are the five essential  features of the cochlea, we hope to design a useful  front-end  filter to  process  acoustic  images and to  obtain  a  better understanding  of the  auditory system.",

It is intended  primarily  for  real-world  real-time  computations  such  as  analysis  of visual  or  acoustical patterns, robotics  and the development of  special purpose  neural nets.  The machine is scalable and  composed of interconnected  modules containing arrays of neurons, modifiable synapses and switches.  It runs  entirely in analog  mode but connection architecture, synaptic  gains and time  constants as well as neuron parameters are set digitally.  Each  neuron has a limited number of inputs and can be connected to any  but not all other neurons. For the determination of synaptic gains and the  implementation  of  learning  algorithms  the  neuron  outputs  are  multiplexed, AID  converted and stored in digital  memory.  Even at  moderate size of 1()3 to IDS neurons  computational speed is expected to  exceed that of any current  digital computer.",

The representation developed to perfOIm the task differs dra(cid:173) matically when the networlc is trained under various conditions, suggesting  the possibility of a novel adaptive autonomous navigation system capable of  tailoring its processing to the conditions at hand.",

It  integrates two subnets, TIN-I  (Winter, Ryan and Turner,  1987) and  TIN-2.  TIN-2  constructs  state  representations  from  examples  of  system behavior, and  its  dynamics are the main  topics of the paper.  TIN-I abstracts transition functions from  noisy state representations  and environmental data during training, while in operation it produces  sequences of transitions in response to variations in input.  Dynamics  of both nets are based on the Adaptive Resonance Theory of Carpenter  and Grossberg (1987).  We give results from an experiment in which  TIN2 learned the behavior of a system that recognizes strings with an  even number of l's .",

Performance effects were measured  by simulating the design as part of a frontend for a speech recognition  system. Circuits are included to implement both activation computations and  weight adaption 'or learning. External access to the analog weight values is  provided to facilitate weight initialization, testing and static storage. This  fully analog implementation requires an order of magnitude less area than  a comparable digital/analog hybrid version developed earlier.",

The quantity that is maximized is the  Shannon  information  rate,  or  equivalently  the  average  mutual  information between input and output.  Several models for the role  of processing noise are analyzed, and the biological motivation for  considering them is described.  For simple models in which nearby  input  signal  values  (in  space  or  time)  are  correlated,  the  cells  resulting  from  this  optimization  process  include  center-surround  cells and cells sensitive to temporal variations in input signal.",

It  is  an  annealing  process  butt  unlike  most  otherst  requires  no  annealing  schedule.  Temperature  is  instead  determined  locally  by  units at each updatet and thus all processing is done at the  unit  level.  There  are  two  major  practical  benefits  to  processing  this  way:  1)  processing  can continue  in  'bad t  areas of the networkt while 'good t areas remain stablet and  2)  processing  continues  in  the  'bad t  areast as  long  as  the  constraints  remain  poorly  satisfied  (i.e.  it  does  not  stop  after  some  predetermined  number of cycles).  As a  resultt  this  method  not  only  avoids  the  kludge  of requiring  an  externally determined annealing schedulet but it also finds  global  maxima  more  quickly  and  consistently  than  externally  scheduled  systems  the  to  Boltzmann machine (Ackley et alt 1985) is made).

In this paper we consider its utility  as a spurious-free content-addressable memory, and provide bounds on  its performance in this context. We show how to exploit the machine's  ability to escape local minima, in order to use it, at a constant  temperature, for unambiguous associative pattern-retrieval in noisy  environments. An association rule, which creates a sphere of influence  around each stored pattern, is used along with the Machine's dynamics  to match the machine's noisy input with one of the pre-stored patterns.  Spurious fIxed points, whose regions of attraction are not recognized by  the rule, are skipped, due to the Machine's fInite probability to escape  from any state. The results apply to the Boltzmann machine and to the  asynchronous net of binary threshold elements (Hopfield model'). They  provide the network designer with worst-case and best-case bounds for  the network's performance, and allow polynomial-time tradeoff studies  of design parameters.",

The main  limitation of the RBP algorithm is that it assumes the convergence of  the network to a stable fixed point in order to backpropagate the error  signals. We show by experiment and eigenvalue analysis that this condi(cid:173) tion can be violated and that chaotic behavior can be avoided. Next we  examine the advantages of RBP over the standard backpropagation al(cid:173) gorithm. RBP is shown to build stable fixed points corresponding to the  input patterns. This makes it an appropriate tool for content address(cid:173) able memories, one-to-many function learning, and inverse problems.",

GEMINI is a hybrid procedure for multilayer networks, which  shares many of the implementation advantages of correlational reinforce(cid:173) ment procedures but is more efficient. GEMINI injects noise only at the  first hidden layer and measures the resultant effect on the output error.  A linear network associated with each hidden layer iteratively inverts the  matrix which relates the noise to the error change, thereby obtaining  the error-derivatives. No back-propagation is involved, thus allowing un(cid:173) known non-linearities in the system. Two simulations demonstrate the  effectiveness of GEMINI.",

The network uses the  pattern of activation over a set of hidden units from time-step t-l,  together with element t, to predict element t+ 1. When the network is  trained with strings from a particular finite-state grammar, it can learn  to be a perfect finite-state recognizer for the grammar. Cluster analyses  of the hidden-layer patterns of activation showed that they encode  prediction-relevant information about the entire path traversed through  the network. We illustrate the phases of learning with cluster analyses  performed at different points during training.",

These models. like most adaptive network  models. are formulated in tenns of frequency (or activation), a useful  abstraction of neuronal firing rates. To more precisely evaluate the  implications of a neuronal model. it may be preferable to develop a  model which transmits discrete pulse-coded information. We point out  that many functions and properties of neuronal processing and learning  may depend. in subtle ways. on the pulse-coded nature of the informa(cid:173) tion coding and transmission properties of neuron systems. When com(cid:173) pared to formulations in terms of activation. computing with temporal  derivatives (or differences) as proposed by Kosko (1986). Klopf  (1988). and Sutton (1988). is both more stable and easier when refor(cid:173) mulated for a more neuronally realistic pulse-coded system. In refor(cid:173) mulating these models in terms of pulse-coding. our motivation has  been to enable us to draw further parallels and connections between  real-time behavioral models of learning and biological circuit models  of the substrates underlying learning and memory.",

They inherently incorporate the sequential character of the  speech signal and are statistically trained. However, the a-priori  choice of the model topology limits their flexibility. Another draw(cid:173) back of these models is their weak discriminating power. Multilayer  perceptrons are now promising tools in the connectionist approach  for classification problems and have already been successfully tested  on speech recognition problems. However, the sequential nature of  the speech signal remains difficult to handle in that kind of ma(cid:173) chine. In this paper, a discriminant hidden Markov model is de(cid:173) fined and it is shown how a particular multilayer perceptron with  contextual and extra feedback input units can be considered as a  general form of such Markov models.",

The lower level  is  a  two-dimensional  diffusion map which  accepts  visual  features  as  input, and spreads activity over larger scales as a function of time. The  upper layer is periodically fed the  activity from  the diffusion layer and  locates local maxima in it (an extreme form  of contrast enhancement)  using a network of local comparators. These local maxima are fed back  to  the  diffusion  layer  using  an  on-center/off-surround  shunting  anatomy. The maxima are also available  as output of the network.  The  network dynamics  serves  to  cluster features  on  multiple  scales  as  a  function of time, and can be used in a variety of early visual processing  tasks such  as:  extraction of comers  and high  curvature  points  along  edge contours, line end detection, gap filling in contours, generation of  fixation points, perceptual grouping on multiple scales, correspondence  and path impletion  in long-range  apparent  motion,  and building  2-D  shape representations that are invariant to  location, orientation, scale,  and small deformation on the visual field.",

In this paper we explore this idea by examining the function of  a  simple  cerebellar-related  behavior,  the  vestibula-ocular  reflex  or  VOR, in  which  eye movements  are generated to minimize image slip  on  the  retina  during  rapid  head  movements.  Considering  this  system  from  the point of view of statistical estimation theory, our results  sug(cid:173) gest that the transfer function of the VOR, often regarded as a static or  slowly  modifiable  feature  of the  system,  should  actually  be  continu(cid:173) ously and rapidly changed during head movements. We further suggest  that these changes are under the direct control of the cerebellar cortex  and propose experiments to test this hypothesis.",

        "abstract": "The application of neural networks to the demodulation of  spread-spectrum signals in a multiple-access environment is  considered. This study is motivated in large part by the fact  that, in a multiuser system, the conventional (matched fil(cid:173) ter) receiver suffers severe performance degradation as the  relative powers of the interfering signals become large (the  \"near-far\" problem). Furthermore, the optimum receiver,  which alleviates the near-far problem, is too complex to be  of practical use. Receivers based on multi-layer perceptrons  are considered as a simple and robust alternative to the opti(cid:173) mum solution. The optimum receiver is used to benchmark  the performance of the neural net receiver; in particular, it is  proven to be instrumental in identifying the decision regions  of the neural networks. The back-propagation algorithm and  a modified version of it are used to train the neural net. An  importance sampling technique is introduced to reduce the  number of simulations necessary to evaluate the performance  of neural nets. In all examples considered the proposed neu(cid:173) ral ~et receiver significantly outperforms the conventional  recelver.",

The  system has been trained and tested on real-world data, derived from zip codes seen  on actual U.S. Mail. The system rejects a small percentage of the examples as  unclassifiable, and achieves a very low error rate on the remaining examples. The  system compares favorably with other state-of-the art recognizers. While some of  the methods are specific to this task, it is hoped that many of the techniques will  be applicable to a wide range of recognition tasks.",

        "abstract": "Nearly optimal solutions to many combinatorial problems can be  found using stochastic simulated annealing. This paper extends  the concept of simulated annealing from its original formulation  as a Markov process to a new formulation based on mean field  theory. Mean field annealing essentially replaces the discrete de(cid:173) grees of freedom in simulated annealing with their average values  as computed by the mean field approximation. The net result is  that equilibrium at a given temperature is achieved 1-2 orders of  magnitude faster than with simulated annealing. A general frame(cid:173) work for the mean field annealing algorithm is derived, and its re(cid:173) lationship to Hopfield networks is shown. The behavior of MFA is  examined both analytically and experimentally for a generic combi(cid:173) natorial optimization problem: graph bipartitioning. This analysis  indicates the presence of critical temperatures which could be im(cid:173) portant in improving the performance of neural networks.",

Questions such  as  how  many  training  patterns  and  training  cycles  are  needed for  a problem of a given size  and difficulty,  how  to represent the  inllUh  and how  to choose useful training exemplars,  are of considerable  theoretical  and  practical  importance.  Several  intuitive  rules  of thumb  have been obtained from empirical studies, but as yet there are few  rig(cid:173) orous  results.  In  this  paper we  summarize  a  study Qf generalization in  the simplest possible case-perceptron networks learning linearly separa(cid:173) ble  functions.  The  task  chosen  was  the majority function  (i.e.  return  a  1  if a  majority  of the  input  units  are  on),  a  predicate  with  a  num(cid:173) ber  of useful  properties.

The basic idea is to iteratively train the network to a cer(cid:173) tain performance criterion, compute a measure of relevance that identi(cid:173) fies which input or hidden units are most critical to performance, and  automatically trim the least relevant units. This skeletonization tech(cid:173) nique can be used to simplify networks by eliminating units that con(cid:173) vey redundant information; to improve learning performance by first  learning with spare hidden units and then trimming the unnecessary  ones away, thereby constraining generalization; and to understand the  behavior of networks in terms of minimal \"rules.\"",

We have tested this assumption in the hippocampus,  a cortical structure or the brain that is involved in long-term memory. A brier,  high-frequency activation or excitatory synapses in the hippocampus produces an  increase in synaptic strength known as long-term potentiation, or L TP (BUss and  Lomo, 1973), that can last ror many days. LTP is known to be Hebbian since it  requires the simultaneous release or neurotransmitter from presynaptic terminals  coupled with postsynaptic depolarization (Kelso et al, 1986; Malinow and Miller,  1986; Gustatrson et al, 1987). However, a mechanism ror the persistent reduction or  synaptic strength that could balance LTP has not yet been demonstrated. We stu(cid:173) died the associative interactions between separate inputs onto the same dendritic  trees or hippocampal pyramidal cells or field CAl, and round that a low-frequency  input which, by itselr, does not persistently change synaptic strength, can either  increase (associative L TP) or decrease in strength (associative long-term depression  or LTD) depending upon whether it is positively or negatively correlated in time  with a second, high-frequency bursting input. LTP or synaptic strength is Hebbian,  and LTD is anti-Hebbian since it is elicited by pairing presynaptic firing with post(cid:173) synaptic hyperpolarization sufficient to block postsynaptic activity. Thus, associa(cid:173) tive L TP and associative L TO are capable or storing inrormation contained in the  covariance between separate, converging hippocampal inputs \u2022",

        "abstract": "The  concept  of  the  stochastic  Boltzmann  machine  (BM)  is  auractive  for  decision  making  and  pattern  classification  purposes  since  the  probability  of  attaining  the network  states  is a  function  of the network energy.  Hence,  the  probability of attaining particular energy minima  may be associated  with  the  probabilities  of  making  certain  decisions  (or  classifications).  However,  because of its stochastic  nature,  the complexity of the BM is fairly  high and  therefore  such  networks  are  not  very  likely  to  be  used  in  practice.  In  this  paper  we  suggest  a  way  to  alleviate  this  drawback  by  converting  the  sto(cid:173) chastic  BM into  a  deterministic  network  which  we  call  the  Boltzmann  Per(cid:173) ceptron  Network  (BPN).  The BPN is functionally  equivalent  to  the  BM but  has  a  feed-forward  structure  and  low  complexity.  No annealing  is required.  The  conditions  under  which  such  a  convmion  is  feasible  are  given.  A  learning  algorithm  for  the  BPN based  on  the  conjugate  gradient  method  is  also provided which is somewhat akin  to the backpropagation algorithm.",

We hope to  learn the  inverse dynamics  by training  a neural network on the  measured  response of a physical ann.  The  input  to  the  network is  a  temporal  window of measured positions;  output is  a vector  of torques.  We  train  the  network on  data measured from  the  first  two joints  of the CMU Direct-Drive Arm II  as  it moves  through a randomly-generated  sample  of \"pick-and-place\"  trajectories.  We  then  test  generalization  with  a  new  trajectory  and  compare  its  output  with  the  torque  measured  at  the  physical arm.  The network  is  shown  to  generalize with  a root mean  square  error/standard deviation  (RMSS)  of 0.10.  We  interpreted the weights  of the  network in tenns of the velocity and acceleration filters  used in  conventional  control  theory.",

        "abstract": "We  address  the  question  of when  a  network  can  be  expected  to  generalize from m  random training examples chosen from some ar(cid:173) bitrary probability distribution, assuming that future test examples  are drawn from  the same  distribution.  Among  our  results are  the  following  bounds on appropriate sample vs.  network size.  Assume  o <  \u00a3  $  1/8.  We  show  that  if m  >  O( ~log~) random  exam(cid:173) ples  can  be  loaded  on  a  feedforward  network  of linear  threshold  functions  with N  nodes and W  weights,  so that at least a  fraction  1 - t of the examples  are  correctly  classified,  then one  has confi(cid:173) dence approaching certainty that the network will correctly classify  a  fraction  1 - \u00a3  of future  test  examples drawn from  the same  dis(cid:173) tribution.  Conversely,  for  fully-connected  feedforward  nets  with  one  hidden  layer,  any learning  algorithm  using  fewer  than  O( '!')  random training examples  will,  for  some distributions of examples  consistent  with  an  appropriate  weight  choice,  fail  at  least  some  fixed fraction of the time to find  a  weight choice that will correctly  classify more  than a 1 - \u00a3  fraction of the future  test examples.",
