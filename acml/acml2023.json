        "abstract": "Sequential maximization of expected improvement (EI) is one of the most widely used policies in Bayesian optimization because of its simplicity and ability to handle noisy observations. In particular, the improvement function often uses the best posterior mean as the best incumbent in noisy settings. However, the uncertainty associated with the incumbent solution is often neglected in many analytic EI-type methods: a closed-form acquisition function is derived in the noise-free setting, but then applied to the setting with noisy observations. To address this limitation, we propose a modification of EI that corrects its closed-form expression by incorporating the covariance information provided by the Gaussian Process (GP) model. This acquisition function specializes to the classical noise-free result, and we argue should replace that formula in Bayesian optimization software packages, tutorials, and textbooks. This enhanced acquisition provides good generality for noisy and noiseless settings. We show that our method achieves a sublinear convergence rate on the cumulative regret bound under heteroscedastic observation noise. Our empirical results demonstrate that our proposed acquisition function can outperform EI in the presence of noisy observations on benchmark functions for black-box optimization, as well as on parameter search for neural network model compression.",

        "abstract": "Reducing the memory usage and computational complexity of high-performance deep neural networks while minimizing degradation of accuracy is a key issue in implementing these models on edge devices. To address this issue, partial quantization methods have been proposed to partially reduce the weight parameters of neural network models. However, the accuracy of existing methods degrades rapidly with increasing compression ratio. Although retraining can compensate for this issue to some extent, it is computationally very expensive. In this study, we propose a mixed-precision quantization algorithm without retraining or degradation in accuracy. In the proposed method, first, the difference between values after and before quantization losses of each channel in the layers of the pretrained model is calculated for all channels. Next, the layers are divided into two groups called semilayers according to whether the loss difference is positive or negative. The priorities for quantization in the semilayers are determined based on the Kulback-Leibler divergence derived from the probability distribution of the softmax output after and before quantization. The same process is repeated as a mixed-precision quantization while gradually decreasing the bitwidth, for example, with 8-, 6-, and 4-bit quantizations, and so forth. The results of an experimental evaluation show that the proposed method successfully compressed a ResNet-18 model by 81.44%, a ResNet-34 model by 84.25%, and a ResNet-50 model by 80.39% on image classification tasks using the ImageNet dataset, and a ResNet-18 model by 80.56% on image classification tasks using the CIFAR-10 dataset, with no degradation of the inference accuracy of the pretrained models.",

The well-known Weisfeiler and Lehman (WL) isomorphism test has been widely used to assess GNNs\u2019 ability to distinguish graph structures. However, despite being considered less expressive than other GNNs in graph-level tasks based on the WL test, two prominent GNN models, namely graph convolution networks (GCN) and attention-based graph networks (GAT), still exhibit strong performance in node-level classification tasks. In this paper, we present a comprehensive analysis of their expressive power using a novel evaluation metric: the number of linear regions. We demonstrate that by enhancing GCN with refined graph Ricci curvature, our proposed high-rank graph convolution network (HRGCN) can match or even surpass the prediction advantage of attention models. Thus, the two models exhibit equivalent node-level expressive powers.

To alleviate this, some studies involve complex designs to obtain independent ID and attribute features and fuse them based on the application scenario (for better accuracy or fairness). In this paper, we obviate their complex design and demonstrate that the Nearest neighbours Proxy Triplet (NPT) loss has an intrinsic capability for feature disentanglement. To further enhance the effectiveness of NPT, we propose a novel margin-based loss, namely Adaptive-rank NPT, which naturally separates the identity and attribute features. While a margin-based loss ensures inter-class separability, it imposes no constraints on intra-class compactness. The samples that meet the inter-class margin will not contribute to network training. To mitigate this issue, we propose an adaptive distance measurement to promote the compactness of the learned features, resulting in the final Ada$^2$NPT loss.

        "abstract": "Recent advances in manifold optimization for the Gaussian mixture model (GMM) have gained increasing interest. In this work, instead of directly addressing the manifold optimization on covariance matrices of GMM, we consider the GMM fitting as an optimization of the density function over a statistical manifold and seek the natural gradient to speed up the optimization process. We present an upper bound for the Kullback\u2013Leibler (KL) divergence between two GMMs and obtain simple closed-form expressions for the natural gradients. With the natural gradients, we then apply the Riemannian stochastic gradient descent (RSGD) algorithm to optimize covariance matrices on a symmetric and positive definite (SPD) matrix manifold.

We present an upper bound for the Kullback\u2013Leibler (KL) divergence between two GMMs and obtain simple closed-form expressions for the natural gradients. With the natural gradients, we then apply the Riemannian stochastic gradient descent (RSGD) algorithm to optimize covariance matrices on a symmetric and positive definite (SPD) matrix manifold.

Although numerous efforts are devoted to tackling this problem, there are still two key challenges that are not well resolved, \\emph{i.e.}, the class imbalance ratio of test samples are extremely larger than that of training samples and amount of detected fraudulent transactions do not be considered. In this paper, we propose a simple and effective framework composed of majority and minority branches to address the above issues. The input samples of majority and minority branches come from vanilla and re-adjusted distribution, respectively. Parameters of each branch are optimized individually, by which the representation learning for majority and minority samples are decoupled. Besides, an extra loss re-weighted by amount is added in the majority branch to improve the recall amount of detected fraudulent transactions. Theoretical results show that under the proposed framework, minimizing the empirical risk is guaranteed to achieve small generalization risk on more imbalanced data with high probability.

The objective of these policies is to match human pickers and robot carriers to fulfill picking tasks, optimizing pick-rate and total tardiness of the orders. In this paper, we propose to formulate the order picking routing problem as a more general combinatorial optimization problem known as Two-sided Online Bipartite Matching. We present an end-to-end Deep Reinforcement Learning approach to optimize a combination of pick-rate and order tardiness, and to deal with the uncertainty of real-world warehouse environments. To extract and exploit spatial information from the environment, we devise three different Graph Neural Network architectures and empirically evaluate them on several scenarios of growing complexity in a simulation environment we developed. We show that all proposed methods significantly outperform greedy and more sophisticated heuristics, as well as non-GNN-based DRL approaches. Moreover, our methods exhibit good transferability properties, even when scaling up test problem instances to more than forty times the size of the ones the models were trained on.

        "abstract": "This study introduces a new approach for open set recognition, wherein we propose a novel method utilizing uniformly distributed centers on a hypersphere. Each class in the proposed method is represented by a center, and these centers and features of the deep learning architecture are jointly learned from the training data in an end-to-end fashion. We ensure that the centers lie on the boundary of a hypersphere whose center is positioned at the origin. The class-specific samples are compelled by the proposed loss function to be closer to their respective centers. In open set recognition scenarios, an additional loss term is employed to separate the background samples from the known class centers. The assignment of test samples to classes is based on the Euclidean distances calculated from the learned class centers. Experimental results show that the proposed method yields the state-of-the-art accuracies on open set recognition datasets.",

        "abstract": "The cold-start problem poses a significant challenge in recommendation systems, particularly when interaction data is scarce. While meta-learning has shown promise in few-shot classification, its application to cold-start recommendations has mostly involved simple transplantations of generic approaches. The effectiveness of metric learning, a powerful meta-learning method, is hindered by differences in problem definition when applied to rating prediction. Heterogeneous information networks (HINs), as high-order graph structures, can capture valuable semantic information even in data-starved conditions. Efficient utilization of HINs can alleviate the cold-start dilemma. However, in the cold-start domain, there is a lack of dynamic node-level and semantic-level feature fusion schemes, resulting in the underutilization of complex information. This study addresses these issues by combining metric learning and HINs, proposing OMHIN (Dynamic Offset Metric approach to Heterogeneous Information Networks). Our approach transforms a direct similarity metric into an indirect metric to enhance model robustness. By flexibly applying one-dimensional convolution, OMHIN effectively integrates rich information from HINs while minimizing noise introduction. Experimental results on two datasets demonstrate that OMHIN achieves state-of-the-art performance in various scenarios, particularly in complex and challenging situations. It is especially suitable for sequence cold-start recommendations.",

This research article investigates the potential of Transformer-based deep learning techniques to accelerate the processing of diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) measures and improve the early diagnosis of Alzheimer disease (AD) using sparse data. Diffusion Weighted Imaging (DWI) is a time-consuming process, with each diffusion direction taking between 2-5 minutes, and at least 40 diffusion directions are needed for routine clinical diagnosis, which needs scanning duration exceeding 3 hours for each patient. By leveraging the attention mechanism, our proposed model generates quantitative measures of fractional anisotropy (FA), axial diffusivity (AxD), and mean diffusivity (MD) using 5 and 21 diffusion directions, making it useful for clinical diagnosis through reduced scanning time of more than half. Our experimental results on the Alzheimer\u2019s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) dataset demonstrate that our proposed model outperforms the traditional linear least square method, achieving accurate quantitative measurement of FA, AxD, and MD scores for early diagnosis of AD patients from healthy controls using sparse diffusion directions.

Input sparsity makes obtaining high-quality embeddings for rarely-occurring categories harder as their representations are updated infrequently. We demonstrate a training-time technique to produce superior embeddings via effective cross-category learning and theoretically explain its surprising effectiveness. The scheme, termed the multi-layer embeddings training (MLET), trains embeddings using factorization of the embedding layer, with an inner dimension higher than the target embedding dimension. For inference efficiency, MLET converts the trained two-layer embedding into a single-layer one thus keeping inference-time model size unchanged. Empirical superiority of MLET is puzzling as its search space is not larger than that of the single-layer embedding. The strong dependence of MLET on the inner dimension is even more surprising. We develop a theory that explains both of these behaviors by showing that MLET creates an adaptive update mechanism modulated by the singular vectors of embeddings. When tested on multiple state-of-the-art recommendation models for click-through rate (CTR) prediction tasks, MLET consistently produces better models, especially for rare items. At constant model quality, MLET allows embedding dimension, and model size, reduction by up to 16x, and 5.8x on average, across the models.",

        "abstract": "Cervical cancer is the most common gynecologic malignancy, and in clinical practice, cervical cancer is best treated if it is detected at an early stage. Thinprep Cytologic Test (TCT) is the best early detection method for cervical cancer as determined by the WHO. As the coverage of early detection of cervical cancer increases, the number of samples in hospitals increases annually, and the pressure on the pathologists to read the cytological images increases, which easily leads to an increase in the rate of misdiagnosis and missed diagnosis. Therefore, automatic detection of abnormal cells in cervical cytology images of cervical fluid using deep learning techniques has become a hot research topic today. However, existing deep learning models for cell detection often collect a single data source from a medical institution for construction. Different medical institutions have different equipment and staining methods, and the accuracy, magnification, and staining results of the images obtained will be different. As a result, the application performance of the model in different medical institution data is not good, and there is a problem of domain shift. To address these problems, this paper proposes a method for cervical fluid-based cell detection based on causal feature extraction. The method is based on the one-stage detection model RetinaNet, and incorporates causal autoencoder to learn the invariant causal feature representation from data. It reduces the impact of task-irrelevant feature representations, reduces the variability of feature distributions in different datasets, and effectively solves the domain shift problem. The addition of deformable convolution and attention mechanism enhances the feature extraction capability for foreground categories with variable shapes in cervical fluid-based pathology images. This reduces the impact of possible strong correlation between background features and goal cells, and reduces the interference of the foreground categories by fading and lack of brightness in the staining. The generalization ability of the model is improved, which makes the model better applicable to different medical institutions. The experimental results show that the method in this paper not only improves the accuracy of the model detection, but also verifies its good generalization effect on different datasets.",

Especially, training CNN models extensively consumes memory mainly due to storing intermediate feature maps generated in the forward-propagation for calculating the gradient in the backpropagation. The memory usage of the CNN model training escalates with the increase in batch size and the complexity of the model. Therefore, a lightweight training method is essential, especially when the computational resources are limited. In this paper, we propose a CNN training mechanism called Facto-CNN, leveraging low-rank tensor factorization and lossy tensor compression to reduce the memory usage required in training the CNN models. Facto-CNN factorizes the weight tensors of convolutional and fully-connected layers and then only updates one of the factorized tensors for each layer, dramatically reducing the feature map size stored in the memory. To further reduce memory consumption, Facto-CNN compresses the feature maps with a simple lossy compression technique that exploits the value similarity in the feature maps. Our experimental evaluation demonstrates that Facto-CNN reduces the memory usage for storing the feature maps by 68-93% with a trivial accuracy degradation when training the CNN models.",

One of the key designs of U-Net is the use of skip connections between the encoder and decoder, which helps to recover detailed information after upsampling. While most variations of U-Net adopt the original skip connection design, there is semantic gap between the encoder and decoder that can negatively impact model performance. Therefore, it is important to reduce this semantic gap before conducting skip connection. To address this issue, we propose a new segmentation network called FusionU-Net, which is based on U-Net structure and incorporates a fusion module to exchange information between different skip connections to reduce semantic gaps. Unlike the other fusion modules in existing networks, ours is based on a two-round fusion design that fully considers the local relevance between adjacent encoder layer outputs and the need for bi-directional information exchange across multiple layers. We conducted extensive experiments on multiple pathology image datasets to evaluate our model and found that FusionU-Net achieves better performance compared to other competing methods. We argue our fusion module is more effective than the designs of existing networks, and it could be easily embedded into other networks to further enhance the model performance.

In this paper, we propose a Group-Wise Quantization framework, called GWQ, to reduce computational consumption during the activation data pass process by allowing multiple layers share one scale factor in SFC operations. Specifically, in the GWQ framework, we propose two algorithms for network layers grouping and model training. For the grouping of network layers, we propose a grouping algorithm based on the similarity of data numerical distribution. Then, the network layers divided into the same group will be quantified using the same common scale factor to reduce the computational consumption. Considering the additional performance loss caused by sharing scale factors among multiple layers, we propose a training algorithm to optimize these shared scale factors and model parameters, by designing a learnable power-of-two scaling parameter for each layer.

However, GNNs are sensitive to the given graph structure, which cast importance on graph structure learning to find optimal graph structures and representations.

Domain generalization is useful in cases where data is limited, difficult, or expensive to collect, such as in object recognition and biomedicine. In this paper, we propose a novel domain generalization algorithm called \"meta-forests\", which builds upon the basic random forests model by incorporating the meta-learning strategy and maximum mean discrepancy measure. The aim of meta-forests is to enhance the generalization ability of classifiers by reducing the correlation among trees and increasing their strength. More specifically, meta-forests conducts meta-learning optimization during each meta-task, while also utilizing the maximum mean discrepancy as a regularization term to penalize poor generalization performance in the meta-test process.

Domain generalization is useful in cases where data is limited, difficult, or expensive to collect, such as in object recognition and biomedicine. In this paper, we propose a novel domain generalization algorithm called \"meta-forests\", which builds upon the basic random forests model by incorporating the meta-learning strategy and maximum mean discrepancy measure. The aim of meta-forests is to enhance the generalization ability of classifiers by reducing the correlation among trees and increasing their strength. More specifically, meta-forests conducts meta-learning optimization during each meta-task, while also utilizing the maximum mean discrepancy as a regularization term to penalize poor generalization performance in the meta-test process. To evaluate the effectiveness of our algorithm, we test it on two publicly object recognition datasets and a glucose monitoring dataset that we have used in a previous study.

Experimental evaluations on three benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of ORAT in handling outliers and adversarial attacks.

        "abstract": "Large neural networks are often overparameterised and prone to overfitting, Dropout is a widely used regularization technique to combat overfitting and improve model generalization. However, unstructured Dropout is not always effective for specific network architectures and this has led to the formation of multiple structured Dropout approaches to improve model performance and, sometimes, reduce the computational resources required for inference.

While well-studied in the classification setup, selective approaches to regression are much less developed. In this work, we consider the nonparametric heteroskedastic regression problem and develop an abstention procedure via testing the hypothesis on the value of the conditional variance at a given point. Unlike existing methods, the proposed one allows to account not only for the value of the variance itself but also for the uncertainty of the corresponding variance predictor.

Interestingly, our results indicated that the detailed explanations were more beneficial to smaller models than larger ones, with the latter gaining nearly the same advantage from any form of explanation, irrespective of its length. Additionally, we demonstrate that the inclusion of explanations enables the models to solve tasks that they were not able to solve without explanations.

Thus, in this paper, we present a simple but efficient segmentation adapter, termed as SegAdapter, which can be plugged into the pretrained vision backbone to improve the performance of existing models for image semantic segmentation. We summarize SegAdapter with three attractive advantages: 1) SegAdapter is a plug-and-play module demonstrating strong adaptability in CNN and Transformer based models such as ConvNext and Segformer, 2) SegAdapter applies a light-weight High-order Spatial Attention (HSA) to make use of intermediate features from the pretrained backbone which extends the model depth and produces auxiliary segmentation maps for model enhancement, 3) SegAdapter builds a powerful vision backbone by incorporating the semantic context into each stage which takes on some of the functions of the segmentation head. So, SegAdapter augmented model can be used in simple designed decode head to avoid heavy computational cost. By plugging multiple SegAdapter layers into different vision backbones, we construct a series of SegAdapter-based segmentation models.

To automate the process of extracting trees from Remote Sensing data and counting thereby, we have used Cartosat-2S merged products @ 0.6m as input.

Extraction of only Trees is not possible with these indices. In this paper we present a novel method for tree delineation from its look-alikes using AIML, concentrating more on preparation of input datasets efficiently. Based on the Spectral Separability analysis, only Red and NIR bands from the satellite imagery are utilized in the proposed method to separate Vegetation from the background classes (such as water, bare soil, terrain, and built-up). In addition to the two bands from satellite imagery entropy layer is computed from the NIR band and utilized as the third band to delineate trees from their look-alikes. Deep Neural Networks have the capability of learning complex patterns that can separate trees and their look-alikes. However, the performance is boosted when the entropy layer is added to the input image. The proposed method showed better performance when utilizing 3 bands Red, NIR, and Entropy bands compared to 4 bands i.e. Red, Green, Blue, and NIR bands.

        "abstract": "Falls are a major cause of injuries and deaths among older adults worldwide. Accurate fall detection can help reduce potential injuries and additional health complications. Different types of video modalities can be used in a home setting to detect falls, including RGB, Infrared, and Thermal cameras. Anomaly detection frameworks using autoencoders and their variants can be used for fall detection due to the data imbalance that arises from the rarity and diversity of falls. However, the use of reconstruction error in autoencoders can limit the application of networks\u2019 structures that propagate information. In this paper, we propose a new multi-objective loss function called Temporal Shift, which aims to predict both future and reconstructed frames within a window of sequential frames. The proposed loss function is evaluated on a semi-naturalistic fall detection dataset containing multiple camera modalities. The autoencoders were trained on normal activities of daily living (ADL) performed by older adults and tested on ADLs and falls performed by young adults. Temporal shift shows significant improvement to a baseline 3D Convolutional autoencoder, an attention U-Net CAE, and a multi-modal neural network. The greatest improvement was observed in an attention U-Net model improving by $0.20$ AUC ROC for a single camera when compared to reconstruction alone. With significant improvement across different models, this approach has the potential to be widely adopted and improve anomaly detection capabilities in other settings besides fall detection.",

In this paper, we propose a new multi-objective loss function called Temporal Shift, which aims to predict both future and reconstructed frames within a window of sequential frames. The proposed loss function is evaluated on a semi-naturalistic fall detection dataset containing multiple camera modalities. The autoencoders were trained on normal activities of daily living (ADL) performed by older adults and tested on ADLs and falls performed by young adults. Temporal shift shows significant improvement to a baseline 3D Convolutional autoencoder, an attention U-Net CAE, and a multi-modal neural network. The greatest improvement was observed in an attention U-Net model improving by $0.20$ AUC ROC for a single camera when compared to reconstruction alone. With significant improvement across different models, this approach has the potential to be widely adopted and improve anomaly detection capabilities in other settings besides fall detection.}\n}",

However, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) used as the backbone for object detection architectures typically neglect Nyquist\u2019s sampling theorem during down-sampling operations, resulting in aliasing and degraded performance. This is likely to be a particular issue for tiny objects that occupy very few pixels and therefore have high spatial frequency features. This paper applied an existing approach WaveCNet for anti-aliasing to tiny object detection. WaveCNet addresses aliasing by replacing standard down-sampling processes in CNNs with Wavelet Pooling (WaveletPool) layers, effectively suppressing aliasing. We modify the original WaveCNet to apply WaveletPool in a consistent way in both pathways of the residual blocks in ResNets. Additionally, we also propose a bottom-heavy version of the backbone, which further improves the performance of tiny object detection while also reducing the required number of parameters by almost half.

While Thompson sampling was originally considered for maximizing the cumulative reward, we demonstrate that it can be used to naturally explore arms in BAI without forcing it. We show that our policy is asymptotically optimal for any two-armed bandit problems and achieves near optimality for general $K$-armed bandit problems for $K \\geq 3$. Nevertheless, in numerical experiments, our policy shows competitive performance compared to asymptotically optimal policies in terms of sample complexity while requiring less computation cost.

        "abstract": "Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) that operate in an event-driven manner and employ binary spike representation have recently emerged as promising candidates for energy-efficient computing. However, a cost bottleneck arises in obtaining high-performance SNNs: training a SNN model requires a large number of time steps in addition to the usual learning iterations, hence this limits their energy efficiency. This paper proposes a general training framework that enhances feature learning and activation efficiency within a limited time step, providing a new solution for more energy-efficient SNNs.  Our framework allows SNN neurons to learn robust spike feature from different receptive fields and update neuron states by utilizing both current stimuli and recurrence information transmitted from other neurons. This setting continuously complements information within a single time step. Additionally, we propose a projection function to merge these two stimuli to smoothly optimize neuron weights (spike firing threshold and activation). We evaluate the proposal for both convolution and recurrent models. Our experimental results indicate state-of-the-art visual classification tasks, including CIFAR10, CIFAR100, and TinyImageNet. Our framework achieves 72.41% and 72.31% top-1 accuracy with only 1 time step on CIFAR100 for CNNs and RNNs, respectively. Our method reduces 10X and 3X joule energy than a standard ANN and SNN, respectively, on CIFAR10, without additional time steps.",

In contrast with the traditional relation extraction on a single sentence, extracting relations from multiple sentences as a whole will harvest more valuable and richer knowledge. Recently, the Transformer-based pre-trained language models (TPLMs) are widely adopted to tackle document-level relation extraction (DocRE). Graph-based methods, aiming to acquire knowledge between entities to form entity-level relation graphs, have facilitated the rapid development of DocRE by infusing their proposed models with the knowledge. However, beyond entity-level knowledge, we discover many other kinds of knowledge that can aid humans to extract relations. It remains unclear whether and in which way they can be adopted to improve the performance of the Transformer, which affects the maximum performance gain of Transformer-based methods. In this paper, we propose a novel weighted multi-channel Transformer (WMCT) to infuse unlimited kinds of knowledge into the vanilla Transformer. Based on WMCT, we also explore five kinds of knowledge to enhance both its reasoning ability and expressive power. Our extensive experimental results demonstrate that: (1) more knowledge makes the performance of the Transformer better and (2) more informative knowledge leads to more performance gain.

Inaccurate shipping cost estimates can lead to bad decision, such as pricing items too low or high, or promoting the wrong product to the customers.

Deep and complex models are able to solve difficult tasks with super-human precision. But for manufacturing quality control, in theory a ideal match for these methods, the step from proof-of-concept towards live deployment is often not feasible. One major obstacle is the unreliability of Machine Learning predictions when confronted with data diverging from the known characteristics. While overall accuracy is high, wrong results may be returned with no indication of their uncertainty. In manufacturing, where scarce errors mean great damages, additional safety measures are required. In this work, I present Visual Machine Learning Control (VMLC), an approach developed upon a real world visual quality control system that operates in a high throughput manufacturing line. Instead of applying sole classification or anomaly detection, both is done in combination. A scalar metric derived from an Auto-Encoder reconstruction error measures the compliance of captured images with the training data the system is trained on. This metric is integrated into the widely used framework of industrial Statistical Process Control (SPC), significantly increasing robustness through meaningful control limits and enabling active learning. The system is evaluated on a large dataset of real-world industrial welding images.",

        "abstract": "Pairwise learning is essential in machine learning, especially for problems involving loss functions defined on pairs of training examples. Online gradient descent (OGD) algorithms have been proposed to handle online pairwise learning, where data arrives sequentially. However, the pairwise nature of the problem makes scalability challenging, as the gradient computation for a new sample involves all past samples. Recent advancements in OGD algorithms have aimed to reduce the complexity of calculating online gradients, achieving complexities less than $O(T)$ and even as low as $O(1)$. However, these approaches are primarily limited to linear models and have induced variance. In this study, we propose a limited memory OGD algorithm that extends to kernel online pairwise learning while improving the sublinear regret. Specifically, we establish a clear connection between the variance of online gradients and the regret, and construct online gradients using the most recent stratified samples with a limited buffer of size of $s$ representing all past data, which have a complexity of $O(sT)$ and employs $O(\\sqrt{T}\\log{T})$ random Fourier features for kernel approximation. Importantly, our theoretical results demonstrate that the variance-reduced online gradients lead to an improved sublinear regret bound. The experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate the superiority of our algorithm over both kernelized and linear online pairwise learning algorithms.The code is available at https://github.com/halquabeh/ACML-2023-FPOGD-Code.git.",
