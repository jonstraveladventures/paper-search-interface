Motivated by risk-averse decision making fields like agriculture, medicine, biology or finance, we do not focus on the mean payoff but on generic functionals of the return distribution. We provide a generic regret analysis of StoROO and illustrate its applicability with two examples: the optimization of quantiles and CVaR. Inspired by the bandit literature and black-box mean optimizers, StoROO relies on the possibility to construct confidence intervals for the targeted functional based on random-size samples. We detail their construction in the case of quantiles, providing tight bounds based on Kullback-Leibler divergence.

In this paper, we develop a novel actor-critic reinforcement learning approach to solve the leader-follower flocking problem in continuous state and action spaces. Specifically, we propose a CACER algorithm that uses multilayer perceptron to represent both the actor and the critic, which has a deeper structure and provides a better function approximator than the original continuous actor-critic learning automation (CACLA) algorithm. Besides, we propose a double prioritized experience replay (DPER) mechanism to further improve the training efficiency. Specifically, the state transition samples are saved into two different experience replay buffers for updating the actor and the critic separately, based on the calculation of sample priority using the temporal difference errors. We have not only compared CACER with CACLA and a benchmark deep reinforcement learning algorithm DDPG in numerical simulation, but also demonstrated the performance of CACER in semi-physical simulation by transferring the learned policy in the numerical simulation without parameter tuning.",

The key idea of anchor-based regression is to solve the regression of the residuals between selected anchors and original target variable, where the variance is expected to be smaller. However, similar to an ordinary regression method, the anchor-based regression could face difficulty on a fine-grained regression and ill-posed problems where the residual variables tend to be too small and complicated to accurately predict. To overcome these problems on the anchor-based regression, we propose to introduce an adaptive residual encoding in which the too small residual is magnified, and the too-large residual is truncated using adaptively tuned sigmoidal function. Our proposed method, called ATR-Nets (Adaptive Truncated Residual-Networks) with an end-to-end architecture could control the range of the target residual to be fitted based on the regression performance, Through experiments with toy-data and the system identification for earthquake asperity models, we show the effectiveness of our proposed method.",

However, the optimization problem for CTW, and its extensions, often fall into poor local minima when the initial solution is far from the global optima. In this paper, we propose \\emph{canonical soft time warping (CSTW)} in which an alignment is modeled as a probabilistic variable that follows the Gibbs distribution with temperature\u00a0$\\gamma$. We also propose the annealing CSTW\u00a0(ACTW), a variant of CSTW that gradually decreases $\\gamma$. ACTW is useful when underlying applications require hard alignments. Using synthetic and real-world data, we experimentally demonstrate that our proposed methods outperform previous methods, including CTW, in estimating alignments. In particular, our method does not suffer from poor local minima, as a consequence of the probabilistic treatment of alignments.",

In the literature, quite a few algorithms have been proposed to conduct community detection by exploiting the topology of social networks and the attributes of social actors.

In this paper, we investigate community detection in social networks aiming to protect the privacy of both the network topologies and the users\u2019 attributes. In particular, we propose a new scheme called differentially private community detection (DPCD).

        "abstract": "In automatic speech recognition, language models (LMs) have been used in many ways to improve performance. Some of the studies have tried to use bidirectional LMs (biLMs) for rescoring the $n$-best hypothesis list decoded from the acoustic model. Despite their theoretical advantages over conventional unidirectional LMs (uniLMs), previous biLMs have not given notable improvements compared to the uniLMs in the experiments. This is due to the architectural limitation that the rightward and leftward representations are not fused in the biLMs. Recently, BERT addressed the same issue by proposing the masked language modeling and achieved state-of-the-art performances in many downstream tasks by fine-tuning the pre-trained BERT. In this paper, we propose an effective sentence scoring method by adjusting the BERT to the $n$-best list rescoring task, which has no fine-tuning step. The core idea of how we modify the BERT for the rescoring task is bridging the gap between training and testing environments by considering the only masked language modeling within a single sentence. Experimental results on the LibriSpeech corpus show that the proposed scoring method using our biLM outperforms uniLMs for the $n$-best list rescoring, consistently and significantly in all experimental conditions. Additionally, an analysis about where word errors occur in a sentence demonstrates that our biLM is more robust than the uniLM especially when a recognized sentence is short or a misrecognized word is at the beginning of the sentence. Consequently, we empirically prove that the left and right representations should be fused in biLMs for scoring a sentence.",

        "abstract": "The bird community in the mangrove areas is an important component of the mangrove wetlands ecosystem and an indicator species for the assessment of the environmental health status of mangrove wetlands. The classification of bird species by the sound of bird in the mangrove areas has the advantages of less interference to the environment and wide monitoring range. In this paper, we propose a novel method that combines the feature recalibration mechanism with depthwise separable convolution for the mangrove bird sound classification. In the proposed method, we introduce Xception network in which depthwise separable convolution with lower parameter number and computational cost than traditional convolution can be stacked in a residual manner, as the baseline network. And we fuse the feature recalibration mechanism into the depthwise separable convolution for actively learning the weights of the feature channels in the network layer, so that we can enhance the important features in bird sound signals to improve the performance of the classification. In the proposed method, firstly we extract three-channel log-mel features of the bird sound signals and we introduce the mixup method to augment the extracted features. Secondly, we construct the recalibrated feature maps including the different scales of information to get the classification results. To verify the effectiveness of the proposed method, we build a dataset with 9282 samples including 25 kinds of the mangrove birds such as Egretta alba, Parus major, Charadrius dubius, etc. habiting in the mangroves of Fangcheng Port of China, and execute the experiments on the built dataset. Furthermore, we also validate the adaptability of our proposed method on the dataset of TAU Urban Acoustic Scenes 2019, and achieve a better result.",

        "abstract": "Nowadays, the top-$k$ accuracy is a major performance criterion when benchmarking multi-class classifier using datasets with a large number of categories. Top-$k$ multiclass SVM has been designed with the aim to minimize the empirical risk based on the top-$k$ accuracy. There already exist two SDCA-based algorithms to learn the top-$k$ SVM, enjoying several preferable properties for optimization, although both the algorithms suffer from two disadvantages. A weak point is that, since the design of the algorithms are specialized only to the top-$k$ hinge, their applicability to other variants is limited. The other disadvantage is that both the two algorithms cannot attain the optimal solution in most cases due to their theoritical imperfections. In this study, a weighted extension of top-$k$ SVM is considered, and novel learning algorithms based on the Frank-Wolfe algorithm is devised. The new learning algorithms possess all the favorable properties of SDCA as well as the applicability not only to the original top-$k$ SVM but also to the weighted extension.

Top-$k$ multiclass SVM has been designed with the aim to minimize the empirical risk based on the top-$k$ accuracy. There already exist two SDCA-based algorithms to learn the top-$k$ SVM, enjoying several preferable properties for optimization, although both the algorithms suffer from two disadvantages. A weak point is that, since the design of the algorithms are specialized only to the top-$k$ hinge, their applicability to other variants is limited. The other disadvantage is that both the two algorithms cannot attain the optimal solution in most cases due to their theoritical imperfections. In this study, a weighted extension of top-$k$ SVM is considered, and novel learning algorithms based on the Frank-Wolfe algorithm is devised. The new learning algorithms possess all the favorable properties of SDCA as well as the applicability not only to the original top-$k$ SVM but also to the weighted extension. Geometrical convergence is achieved by smoothing the loss functions. Numerical simulations demonstrate that only the proposed Frank-Wolfe algorithms can converge to the optimum, in contrast with the failure of the two existing SDCA-based algorithms.

This paper studies equivalence structure in the reinforcement learning (RL) setup, where transition distributions are no longer assumed to be known. We present a notion of similarity between transition probabilities of various state-action pairs of an MDP, which naturally defines an equivalence structure in the state-action space. We present equivalence-aware confidence sets for the case where the learner knows the underlying structure in advance. These sets are provably smaller than their corresponding equivalence-oblivious counterparts. In the more challenging case of an unknown equivalence structure, we present an algorithm called ApproxEquivalence that seeks to find an (approximate) equivalence structure, and define confidence sets using the approximate equivalence. To illustrate the efficacy of the presented confidence sets, we present C-UCRL, as a natural modification of UCRL2 for RL in undiscounted MDPs. In the case of a known equivalence structure, we show that C-UCRL improves over UCRL2 in terms of \\emph{regret} by a factor of $\\sqrt{SA/C}$, in any communicating MDP with $S$ states, $A$ actions, and $C$ classes, which corresponds to a massive improvement when $C\\ll SA$. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work providing regret bounds for RL when an equivalence structure in the MDP is efficiently exploited. In the case of an unknown equivalence structure, we show through numerical experiments that C-UCRL combined with ApproxEquivalence outperforms UCRL2 in ergodic MDPs.",

To illustrate the efficacy of the presented confidence sets, we present C-UCRL, as a natural modification of UCRL2 for RL in undiscounted MDPs. In the case of a known equivalence structure, we show that C-UCRL improves over UCRL2 in terms of \\emph{regret} by a factor of $\\sqrt{SA/C}$, in any communicating MDP with $S$ states, $A$ actions, and $C$ classes, which corresponds to a massive improvement when $C\\ll SA$. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work providing regret bounds for RL when an equivalence structure in the MDP is efficiently exploited. In the case of an unknown equivalence structure, we show through numerical experiments that C-UCRL combined with ApproxEquivalence outperforms UCRL2 in ergodic MDPs.}\n}",

However, most existing Siamese frameworks describe the target appearance using a global pattern from the last layer, leading to high sensitivity to similar distractors, non-rigid appearance change, and partial occlusion. Addressing these issues, we propose a Multi-branch Siamese network (MSiam) for high-performance object tracking. The MSiam performs layer-wise feature aggregations and simultaneously considers the global-local patterns for more accurate target tracking. In particular, we propose a feature aggregation module (FAM) keeping the heterogeneity of the three types of features, further improving the discriminability of MSiam using both high-level semantic and low-level spatial information. To enhance the adaptability to non-rigid appearance change and partial occlusion, a multi-scale local pattern detection module (LPDM) is designed to identify discriminative regions of the target objects. By considering various combinations of the local structures, our tracker can form various types of structure patterns.

        "abstract": "PAC-Bayesian set up involves a stochastic classifier characterized by a posterior distribution on a classifier set, offers a high probability bound on its averaged true risk and is robust to the training sample used. For a given posterior, this bound captures the trade off between averaged empirical risk and KL-divergence based model complexity term. Our goal is to identify an optimal posterior with the least PAC-Bayesian bound. We consider a finite classifier set and 5 distance functions: KL-divergence, its Pinsker\u2019s and a sixth degree polynomial approximations; linear and squared distances. Linear distance based model results in a convex optimization problem and we obtain a closed form expression for its optimal posterior. For uniform prior, this posterior has full support with weights negative-exponentially proportional to number of misclassifications. Squared distance and Pinsker\u2019s approximation bounds are possibly quasi-convex and are observed to have single local minimum. We derive fixed point equations (FPEs) using partial KKT system with strict positivity constraints. This obviates the combinatorial search for subset support of the optimal posterior. For uniform prior, exponential search on a full-dimensional simplex can be limited to an ordered subset of classifiers with increasing empirical risk values. These FPEs converge rapidly to a stationary point, even for a large classifier set when a solver fails. We apply these approaches to SVMs generated using a finite set of SVM regularization parameter values on 9 UCI datasets. The resulting optimal posteriors (on the set of regularization parameters) yield stochastic SVM classifiers with tight bounds. KL-divergence based bound is the tightest, but is computationally expensive due to its non-convex nature and multiple calls to a root finding algorithm. Optimal posteriors for all 5 distance functions have lowest 10% test error values on most datasets, with that of linear distance being the easiest to obtain.",

However, it is still difficult to learn stably and efficiently because the learning method usually uses a nonlinear function approximation. Neural Episodic Control (NEC), which has been proposed in order to improve sample efficiency, is able to learn stably by estimating action values using a non-parametric method. In this paper, we propose an architecture that incorporates random projection into NEC to train with more stability. In addition, we verify the effectiveness of our architecture by Atari\u2019s five games. The main idea is to reduce the number of parameters that have to learn by replacing neural networks with random projection in order to reduce dimensions while keeping the learning end-to-end.",

However, the features learned only using the softmax loss are not discriminative enough for highly accurate facial expression recognition in the wild, especially for the compound facial expression recognition. To enhance the discriminative power of the learned features, we propose the separate loss for both basic and compound facial expression recognition in the wild in this paper. Such loss maximizes intra-class similarity while minimizing the similarity between different classes. The qualitative and quantitative analysis shows that the features learned using such loss function are characterized by intra-class compactness and inter-class separation.

However, the features learned only using the softmax loss are not discriminative enough for highly accurate facial expression recognition in the wild, especially for the compound facial expression recognition. To enhance the discriminative power of the learned features, we propose the separate loss for both basic and compound facial expression recognition in the wild in this paper. Such loss maximizes intra-class similarity while minimizing the similarity between different classes. The qualitative and quantitative analysis shows that the features learned using such loss function are characterized by intra-class compactness and inter-class separation.

In such cases, it is challenging to control the variance of the gradient estimator used in stochastic variational inference, while low variance is often one of the key properties needed for successful inference. In this work, we present a new algorithm for stochastic variational inference of sequential models which trades off bias for variance to tackle this challenge effectively.

We consider the situation where domain shift is caused by a prior change of a specific factor and assume that we know how the prior changes between source and target domains. We call this factor an attribute, and reformulate the domain adaptation problem to utilize the attribute prior instead of target data. In our method, the source data are reweighted with the sample-wise weight estimated by the attribute prior and the data themselves so that they are useful in the target domain.

We consider the situation where domain shift is caused by a prior change of a specific factor and assume that we know how the prior changes between source and target domains. We call this factor an attribute, and reformulate the domain adaptation problem to utilize the attribute prior instead of target data. In our method, the source data are reweighted with the sample-wise weight estimated by the attribute prior and the data themselves so that they are useful in the target domain. We theoretically reveal that our method provides more precise estimation of sample-wise transferability than a straightforward attribute-based reweighting approach. Experimental results with both toy datasets and benchmark datasets show that our method can perform well, though it does not use any target data.}\n}",
