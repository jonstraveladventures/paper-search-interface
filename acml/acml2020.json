Traditional foreground detection algorithms can not adapt to these scenarios well, since they are sensitive to the sudden large change of pixel values and the threshold of pixel values difference people pick. Therefore, this paper proposes a pixel-insensitive and threshold-free algorithm to deal with the above scenarios. It is an end-to-end model based on deep learning.

        "abstract": "Multi-view subspace learning aims to learn a shared representation from multiple sources or views of an entity. The learned representation enables reconstruction of common patterns of multi-view data, which helps dimensional reduction, exploratory data analysis, missing view completion, and various downstream tasks. However, existing methods often use simple structured approximations of the posterior of shared latent variables for the sake of computational efficiency. Such oversimplified models have a huge impact on the inference quality and can hurt the representation power. To this end, we propose a new method for multi-view subspace learning that achieves efficient Bayesian inference with strong representation power. Our method, coined CCA-Flow, bases on variational Canonical Correlation Analysis and models the inference network as an Inverse Autoregressive Flow (IAF).

The learned representation enables reconstruction of common patterns of multi-view data, which helps dimensional reduction, exploratory data analysis, missing view completion, and various downstream tasks. However, existing methods often use simple structured approximations of the posterior of shared latent variables for the sake of computational efficiency. Such oversimplified models have a huge impact on the inference quality and can hurt the representation power. To this end, we propose a new method for multi-view subspace learning that achieves efficient Bayesian inference with strong representation power. Our method, coined CCA-Flow, bases on variational Canonical Correlation Analysis and models the inference network as an Inverse Autoregressive Flow (IAF). With the flow-based variational inference imposed on the latent variables, the posterior approximations can be arbitrarily complex and flexible, and the model can still be efficiently trained with stochastic gradient descent. Experiments on three benchmark multi-view datasets show that our model gives improved representations of shared latent variables and has superior performance against previous works.}\n}",

Factors in sequential data are categorized into dynamic and static ones: dynamic factors are time dependent, and static factors are time independent. Previous models disentangle between static and dynamic factors and between dynamic factors with different time dependencies by explicitly modeling the priors of latent variables.

Conventional count-based models like LDA focus on co-occurrence of words, neglecting features like semantics and lexical relations in the corpora. To overcome this drawback, many knowledge-enhanced models are proposed, attempting to achieve better topic coherence with external knowledge. In this paper, we present novel probabilistic topic models utilizing both explicit and implicit knowledge forms. Knowledge of real-world entities in a knowledge base/graph are referred to as explicit knowledge. We incorporate this knowledge form into our models by entity linking, a technique for bridging the gap between corpora and knowledge bases. This helps solving the problem of token/phrase-level synonymy and polysemy. Apart from explicit knowledge, we utilize latent feature word representations (implicit knowledge) to further capture lexical relations in pretraining corpora. Qualitative and Quantitative evaluations are conducted on 2 datasets with 5 baselines (3 probabilistic models and 2 neural models). Our models exhibit high potential in generating coherent topics. Remarkably, when adopting both explicit and implicit knowledge, our proposed model even outperforms 2 state-of-the-art neural topic models, suggesting that knowledge-enhancement can highly improve the performance of conventional topic models.",

In this setting, we only get to know whether our predicted label is correct or not. Due to which, we are left in uncertainty about the actual class label when we predict the wrong class. This paper proposes exact passive-aggressive online algorithms for multiclass classification under bandit feedback (EPABF). The proposed approach uses an exploration-exploitation strategy to guess the class label in every trial. To update the weights, we solve a quadratic optimization problem under multiple class separability constraints and find the exact solution. We do this by finding active constraints using the KKT conditions of the optimization problem. These constraints form a support set that determines the classes for which the weight vector needs to be updated. We propose three different variants of the weight update rule, which vary based on the aggressiveness to correct the mistake. These are called EPABF, EPABF-I, and EPABF-II. We also provide mistake bounds for the proposed EPABF, EPABF-I, and EPABF-II.

Recently, filter pruning had been introduced as a promising model compression method to reduce computation cost and storage overhead. However, existing filter pruning approaches are mainly model-based, which rely on empirical model to evaluate the importance of filters and set parameters manually to guide model compression. In this paper, we observe that CNNs commonly consist of large amount of inactive filters, and introduce Filter Inactive RatE (FIRE), a novel metric to evaluate the importance of filters in a neural network. Based on FIRE, we develop a learning based filter pruning strategy called FIREPruning for fast model compression. It adopts a regression model to predict the FIRE value and uses a three stage pipeline (FIRE prediction, pruning, and fine-tuning) to compress the neural network efficiently. Extensive experiments based on widely-used CNN models and well-known datasets show that FIREPruning reduces overall computation cost up to 86.9% without sacrificing too much accuracy, which significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art model compression methods.",

        "abstract": "The problem of learning from label proportions (LLP) involves training classifiers with weak labels on bags of instances, rather than strong labels on individual instances. The weak labels only contain the label proportion of each bag. The LLP problem is important for many practical applications that only allow label proportions to be collected because of data privacy or annotation cost, and has recently received lots of research attention. Most existing works focus on extending supervised learning models to solve the LLP problem, but the weak learning nature makes it hard to further improve LLP performance with a supervised angle. In this paper, we take a different angle from semi-supervised learning. In particular, we propose a novel model inspired by consistency regularization, a popular concept in semi-supervised learning that encourages the model to produce a decision boundary that better describes the data manifold. With the introduction of consistency regularization, we further extend our study to non-uniform bag-generation and validation-based parameter-selection procedures that better match practical needs.

The weak labels only contain the label proportion of each bag. The LLP problem is important for many practical applications that only allow label proportions to be collected because of data privacy or annotation cost, and has recently received lots of research attention. Most existing works focus on extending supervised learning models to solve the LLP problem, but the weak learning nature makes it hard to further improve LLP performance with a supervised angle. In this paper, we take a different angle from semi-supervised learning. In particular, we propose a novel model inspired by consistency regularization, a popular concept in semi-supervised learning that encourages the model to produce a decision boundary that better describes the data manifold. With the introduction of consistency regularization, we further extend our study to non-uniform bag-generation and validation-based parameter-selection procedures that better match practical needs. Experiments not only justify that LLP with consistency regularization achieves superior performance, but also demonstrate the practical usability of the proposed procedures.}\n}",

Recently, a non-NN style deep model called Deep Forest or gcForest was proposed by Zhou and Feng, which is a deep learning model based on random forests and the training process does not rely on backpropagation. In this paper, we propose PSForest, which can be regarded as a modification of the standard Deep Forest. The main idea for improving the efficiency and performance of the Deep Forest is to do multi-grained pooling of raw features and screening the class vector of each layer based on out-of-bag error.

Recently, a non-NN style deep model called Deep Forest or gcForest was proposed by Zhou and Feng, which is a deep learning model based on random forests and the training process does not rely on backpropagation. In this paper, we propose PSForest, which can be regarded as a modification of the standard Deep Forest. The main idea for improving the efficiency and performance of the Deep Forest is to do multi-grained pooling of raw features and screening the class vector of each layer based on out-of-bag error. The experiment on different datasets shows that our proposed model achieves predictive accuracy comparable to or better than gcForest, with lower memory requirement and smaller time cost.

The word mover\u2019s distance (WMD) has been successfully applied to measure the document distance by synthesizing the low-level word similarity with the framework of optimal transport (OT).

In this paper, we propose to address this overestimation issue with a novel Wasserstein-Fisher-Rao (WFR) document distance grounded on unbalanced optimal transport theory. Compared to the WMD, the WFR document distance provides a trade-off between global transportation and local truncation, which leads to a better similarity measure for unequal semantic details. Moreover, an efficient prune strategy is particularly designed for the WFR document distance to facilitate the top-k queries among a large number of documents.

In psychological game theory, guilt aversion necessitates modelling of agents that have theory about what other agents think, also known as Theory of Mind (ToM). We aim to build a new kind of affective reinforcement learning agents, called Theory of Mind Agents with Guilt Aversion (ToMAGA), which are equipped with an ability to think about the wellbeing of others instead of just self-interest. To validate the agent design, we use a general-sum game known as Stag Hunt as a test bed. As standard reinforcement learning agents could learn suboptimal policies in social dilemmas like Stag Hunt, we propose to use belief-based guilt aversion as a reward shaping mechanism. We show that our belief-based guilt averse agents can efficiently learn cooperative behaviours in Stag Hunt Games.",

In this paper, we study Thompson Sampling based algorithm for Unsupervised Sequential Selection (USS) problem. The USS problem is a variant of the stochastic multi-armed bandits problem, where the loss of an arm can not be inferred from the observed feedback. In the USS setup, arms are associated with fixed costs and are ordered, forming a cascade. In each round, the learner selects an arm and observes the feedback from arms up to the selected arm. The learner\u2019s goal is to find the arm that minimizes the expected total loss. The total loss is the sum of the cost incurred for selecting the arm and the stochastic loss associated with the selected arm. The problem is challenging because, without knowing the mean loss, one cannot compute the total loss for the selected arm. Clearly, learning is feasible only if the optimal arm can be inferred from the problem structure.

Moreover, the perturbed inputs can transfer between different models: adversarial examples generated based on a specific model will often fool other unseen models with a significant success rate. This allows the adversary to leverage it to attack the deployed systems without any query, which could raise severe security issue particularly in safety-critical scenarios. In this work, we empirically investigate two classes of factors that might influence the transferability of adversarial examples. One is about model-specific factors, including network architecture, model capacity and test accuracy. The other is the local smoothness of loss surface for generating adversarial examples. More importantly, relying on these findings on the transferability of adversarial examples, we propose a simple but effective strategy to improve the transferability, whose effectiveness is confirmed through extensive experiments on both CIFAR-10 and ImageNet datasets.",
