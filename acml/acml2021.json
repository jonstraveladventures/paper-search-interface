        "abstract": "Integrating multiple comments into a concise statement for any online products or web services requires a non-trivial understanding of the input. Recently, graph neural networks (GNN) has been successfully applied to learn from highly-structured graph representations to mitigate the relationship between entities, such as co-references. However, current inter-sentence relation extraction cannot leverage discrete reasoning chains over multiple comments. To address this issue, in this paper, we propose a probabilistic $K$-hop knowledge graph (KKG) to extend existing knowledge graphs with inferred relations via discrete intra-sentence and inter-sentence reasoning chains. KKG associates each inferred relation with a confidence value through Bayesian inference. We further answer how a knowledge graph with inferred relations can help the multiple comments integration through integrating KKG with GNN ($\\text{K}^2$-GNN). Our extensive experimental results show that our $\\text{K}^2$-GNN outperforms all baseline graph models on multiple comments integration.",

LLP aims to learn an instance-level classifier given a number of bags and each bag is composed of several instances. The label of each instance is concealed and what we know is the proportion of each class in each bag. The lack of instance-level supervision information makes the model struggle for finding the right direction for optimization. In this paper, we solve this problem by developing a two-stage training framework. First, we facilitate contrastive learning to train a feature extractor in an unsupervised way. Second, we train a linear classifier with the parameter of the feature extractor fixed. This framework performs much better than most baselines but is still unsatisfactory when the bag size or the number of classes is large. Therefore, we further propose a Feature-Label Matching mechanism (FLMm). FLMm can provide a roughly right optimization direction for the classifier by assigning labels to a subset of instances selected in this bag with a high degree of confidence. Therefore, the classifier can more easily establish the correspondence between instances and labels in the second stage. Experimental results on two benchmark datasets, namely CIFAR10 and CIFAR100, show that our model is far superior than baseline models, for example, accuracy increases from 43.44% to 61.25% for bag size 128 on CIFAR100.",

Experimental results on two benchmark datasets, namely CIFAR10 and CIFAR100, show that our model is far superior than baseline models, for example, accuracy increases from 43.44% to 61.25% for bag size 128 on CIFAR100.}\n}",

Compared with binocular technology and lidar technology, its cost is lower. In this paper, based on the existing monocular 3D recognition network, we propose an asymmetrical segmentation depth-aware network: ASD-Conv Network, which is used to better obtain the depth information of monocular images, so as to obtain better recognition results. Compared with other monocular recognition networks, ASD-Conv network performs special segmentation on the image, which can better obtain the depth distribution of the image, and has made a good breakthrough and improvement in the image recognition tasks of 2D, BEV and 3D. The improved algorithm proposed in this paper can improve the detection accuracy while maintaining a certain real-time performance. Experimental results show that compared with the current model, the proposed monocular 3D object detection algorithm based on D-ASDConv has an average improvement rate of 2.82%(AP) in large object detection and the highest average improvement rate of 2.01%(AP) in small object detection on Kitti dataset. The algorithm can effectively learn more advanced features of spatial perception, and the detection results of monocular images are more accurate.",

The goal of Offline Reinforcement Learning is to address this problem by learning effective policies using previously collected datasets. Standard off-policy RL algorithms are prone to overestimations of the values of out-of-distribution (less explored) actions and are hence unsuitable for Offline RL. Behavior regularization, which constraints the learned policy within the support set of the dataset, has been proposed to tackle the limitations of standard off-policy algorithms. In this paper, we improve the behavior regularized offline reinforcement learning and propose BRAC+. First, we propose quantification of the out-of-distribution actions and conduct comparisons between using Kullback\u2013Leibler divergence versus using Maximum Mean Discrepancy as the regularization protocol. We propose an analytical upper bound on the KL divergence as the behavior regularizer to reduce variance associated with sample based estimations. Second, we mathematically show that the learned Q values can diverge even using behavior regularized policy update under mild assumptions. This leads to large overestimations of the Q values and performance deterioration of the learned policy. To mitigate this issue, we add a gradient penalty term to the policy evaluation objective. By doing so, the Q values are guaranteed to converge. On challenging offline RL benchmarks, BRAC+  outperforms the baseline behavior regularized approaches by $40%\\sim 87%$ and the state-of-the-art approach by $6%$.",

        "abstract": "While data sharing is crucial for knowledge development, privacy concerns and strict regulation (e.g., European General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)) unfortunately limit its full effectiveness. Synthetic tabular data emerges as an alternative to enable data sharing while fulfilling regulatory and privacy constraints. The state-of-the-art tabular data synthesizers draw methodologies from Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN) and address two main data types in industry, i.e., continuous and categorical. In this paper, we develop CTAB-GAN, a novel conditional table GAN architecture that can effectively model diverse data types, including a mix of continuous and categorical variables. Moreover, we address data imbalance and long tail issues, i.e., certain variables have drastic frequency differences across large values. To achieve those aims, we first introduce the information loss, classification loss and generator loss to the conditional GAN. Secondly, we design a novel conditional vector, which efficiently encodes the mixed data type and skewed distribution of data variable.

Synthetic tabular data emerges as an alternative to enable data sharing while fulfilling regulatory and privacy constraints. The state-of-the-art tabular data synthesizers draw methodologies from Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN) and address two main data types in industry, i.e., continuous and categorical. In this paper, we develop CTAB-GAN, a novel conditional table GAN architecture that can effectively model diverse data types, including a mix of continuous and categorical variables. Moreover, we address data imbalance and long tail issues, i.e., certain variables have drastic frequency differences across large values. To achieve those aims, we first introduce the information loss, classification loss and generator loss to the conditional GAN. Secondly, we design a novel conditional vector, which efficiently encodes the mixed data type and skewed distribution of data variable. We extensively evaluate CTAB-GAN with the state of the art GANs that generate synthetic tables, in terms of data similarity and analysis utility. The results on five datasets show that the synthetic data of CTAB-GAN remarkably resembles the real data for all three types of variables and results into higher accuracy for five machine learning algorithms, by up to 17%.}\n}",

Recent results suggest that trilinear products of quaternion-valued embeddings can be a more effective means to tackle link prediction. In addition, models based on convolutions on real-valued embeddings often yield state-of-the-art results for link prediction. In this paper, we investigate a composition of convolution operations with hypercomplex multiplications. We propose the four approaches QMult, OMult, ConvQ and ConvO  to tackle the link prediction problem. QMult and OMult can be considered as quaternion and octonion extensions of previous state-of-the-art approaches, including DistMult and ComplEx. ConvQ and ConvO build upon QMult and OMult by including convolution operations in a way inspired by the residual learning framework. We evaluated our approaches on seven link prediction datasets including WN18RR, FB15K-237 and YAGO3-10. Experimental results suggest that the benefits of learning hypercomplex-valued vector representations become more apparent as the size and complexity of the knowledge graph grows. ConvO outperforms state-of-the-art approaches on FB15K-237 in MRR, Hit@1 and Hit@3, while QMult, OMult, ConvQ and ConvO outperform state-of-the-approaches on YAGO3-10 in all metrics.

Besides, although a variety of information is available in precipitation forecast, it would not be straightforwardly to incorporate the additional information in the existing methods. To overcome these problems, we propose an encoder-decoder-based image transformation method that generates a weight image that is optimized in a pixel-wise manner and additional information could be embedded as the channel of input images and feature maps.

        "abstract": "Given a fixed parameter budget, one can build a single large neural network or create a memory-split ensemble: a pool of several smaller networks with the same total parameter count as the single network. A memory-split ensemble can outperform its single model counterpart (Lobacheva et al., 2020): a phenomenon known as the memory-split advantage (MSA). The reasons for MSA are still not yet fully understood. In particular, it is difficult in practice to predict when it will exist. This paper sheds light on the reasons underlying MSA using random feature theory. We study the dependence of the MSA on several factors: the parameter budget, the training set size, the L2 regularization and the Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) hyper-parameters. Using the bias-variance decomposition, we show that MSA exists when the reduction in variance due to the ensemble (\\ie, \\textit{ensemble gain}) exceeds the increase in squared bias due to the smaller size of the individual networks (\\ie, \\textit{shrinkage cost}). Taken together, our theoretical analysis demonstrates that the MSA mainly exists for the small parameter budgets relative to the training set size, and that memory-splitting can be understood as a type of regularization. Adding other forms of regularization, \\eg L2 regularization, reduces the MSA. Thus, the potential benefit of memory-splitting lies primarily in the possibility of speed-up via parallel computation. Our empirical experiments with deep neural networks and large image datasets show that MSA is not a general phenomenon, but mainly exists when the number of training iterations is small.",

While current voice cloning methods achieve promising results in Text-to-Speech (TTS) synthesis for a new voice, these approaches lack the ability to control the expressiveness of synthesized audio. In this work, we propose a controllable voice cloning method that allows fine-grained control over various style aspects of the synthesized speech for an unseen speaker.

Through both quantitative and qualitative evaluations, we show that our framework can be used for various expressive voice cloning tasks using only a few transcribed or untranscribed speech samples for a new speaker.

        "abstract": "For lower bit-widths such as less than 8-bit, many quantization strategies include re-training in order to recover accuracy degradation. However, the re-training works against rapid deployment for wide distribution of quantized models. Therefore, post-training quantization has been getting more attention in recent years. In one example, partial quantization according to the layer sensitivity based on the accuracy after each quantization has been proposed; however, the effects of one layer quantization on the other layers has not taken into account. To further reduce the accuracy degradation, we propose a quantization scheme that considers the effects by continuously updating the accuracy after each layer quantization. Additionally, for more data compression, we extend that scheme to mixed precision, which applies a layer-by-layer fitted bit-width. Since the search space for bit allocation per layer increases exponentially with the number of layers $N$, Existing methods require computationally intensive approach such as network training. Here, we derive practical solutions to the bit allocation problem in polynomial time $O(N^2)$ using a deterministic greedy search algorithm inspired by submodular optimization without any training. For example, the proposed algorithm completes a search on ResNet18 for ImageNet in 1 hour for a single GPU. Compared to the case without updating the layer sensitivity, our method improves the accuracy of the quantized model by more than 1% with multiple convolutional neural networks. For examples, 6-bit quantization of MobileNetV2 achieves 80.1% reduction of model size with -1.10% accuracy degradation. 4-bit quantization of ResNet50 achieves 82.9% size reduction with -0.194% accuracy degradation. Furthermore, results show that the proposed method reduces the accuracy degradation by more than about 0.7% compared to various latest post-training quantization strategies.",

Machine learning methods, specifically supervised learning is commonly used in a variety of tasks formulated as semantic segmentation. One of the major challenges in the supervised learning approaches is expressing and collecting the rich knowledge that experts have with respect to the meaning present in the image data.

The approach of dealing with text summarization can be roughly divided into two main paradigms: extractive and abstractive manner. The former allows capturing the most representative snippets in a document while the latter generates a summary by understanding the latent meaning in a material with a language generation model. Recently, studies found that jointly employing the extractive and abstractive summarization models can take advantage of their complementary advantages, creating both concise and informative summaries. However, the reinforced summarization models mainly depend on the ROUGE-based reward, which only has the ability to quantify the extent of word-matching rather than semantic-matching between document and summary. Meanwhile, documents are usually collected with redundant or noisy information due to the existence of repeated or irrelevant information in real-world applications. Therefore, only depending on ROUGE-based reward to optimize the reinforced summarization models may lead to biased summary generation.

The success of heuristic algorithms relies heavily on the design of powerful heuristic rules, and most of the existing heuristic rules were manually designed by experienced experts to model their insights and observations on TSP instances and solutions. Recent studies have shown an alternative promising design strategy that directly learns heuristic rules from TSP instances without any manual interference. Here, we report an iterative improvement approach (called Neural-3-OPT) that solves TSP through automatically learning effective 3-opt heuristics via deep reinforcement learning. In the proposed approach, we adopt a pointer network to select 3 links from the current tour,and a feature-wise linear modulation network to select an appropriate way to reconnect the segments after removing the selected 3 links.

Here, we report an iterative improvement approach (called Neural-3-OPT) that solves TSP through automatically learning effective 3-opt heuristics via deep reinforcement learning. In the proposed approach, we adopt a pointer network to select 3 links from the current tour,and a feature-wise linear modulation network to select an appropriate way to reconnect the segments after removing the selected 3 links. We demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance on both real TSP instances and randomly-generated instances than, to the best of our knowledge, the existing neural network-based approaches.}\n}",

        "abstract": "We consider the query recommendation problem in closed loop interactive learning settings like online information gathering and exploratory analytics. The problem can be naturally modelled using the Multi-Armed Bandits (MAB) framework with countably many arms. The standard MAB algorithms for countably many arms begin with selecting a random set of candidate arms and then applying standard MAB algorithms, e.g., UCB, on this candidate set downstream. We show that such a selection strategy often results in higher cumulative regret and to this end, we propose a selection strategy based on the maximum utility of the arms. We show that in tasks like online information gathering, where sequential query recommendations are employed, the sequences of queries are correlated and the number of potentially optimal queries can be reduced to a manageable size by selecting queries with maximum utility with respect to the currently executing query. Our experimental results using a recent real online literature discovery service log file demonstrate that the proposed arm selection strategy improves the cumulative regret substantially with respect to the state-of-the-art baseline algorithms.

Furthermore, compared with other common methods, the proposed method uses less new-subject data, which improves its practicability in practical application.}\n}",

        "abstract": "The benchmark datasets for neural architecture search (NAS) have been developed to alleviate the computationally expensive evaluation process and ensure a fair comparison. Recent NAS benchmarks only focus on architecture optimization, although the training hyperparameters affect the obtained model performances. Building the benchmark dataset for joint optimization of architecture and training hyperparameters is essential to further NAS research. The existing NAS-HPO-Bench is a benchmark for joint optimization, but it does not consider the network connectivity design as done in modern NAS algorithms. This paper introduces the first benchmark dataset for joint optimization of network connections and training hyperparameters, which we call NAS-HPO-Bench-II. We collect the performance data of 4K cell-based convolutional neural network architectures trained on the CIFAR-10 dataset with different learning rate and batch size settings, resulting in the data of 192K configurations. The dataset includes the exact data for 12 epoch training. We further build the surrogate model predicting the accuracies after 200 epoch training to provide the performance data of longer training epoch. By analyzing NAS-HPO-Bench-II, we confirm the dependency between architecture and training hyperparameters and the necessity of joint optimization. Finally, we demonstrate the benchmarking of the baseline optimization algorithms using NAS-HPO-Bench-II.",

It is challenging to develop effective approaches to model and exploit these various and heterogeneous data. Recently, heterogeneous information network (HIN) has been adopted to model the context data due to its flexibility in modelling data heterogeneity. However, most of the HIN-based methods, which rely on meta paths or graph embedding to extract features from HINs, cannot fully mine the network structure and semantic features of users and items. Besides, these methods, utilizing the global dataset to learn personalized latent factors, usually suffer individuality loss problem. In this paper, we propose a neural graph filtering method for context-aware recommendation, called NGF. First, we use an unified HIN to model both the users\u2019 feedback information and the context data. Then, we adopt graph filtering to predict aspect-level ratings on a series of independent subgraphs of the unified HIN and feed a deep neural network (DNN) to fuse the predictions for CAR. Concretely, graph filtering is a case-by-case algorithm for personalized recommendation on HINs, which predicts the further behavior by all its similar historical behaviors. We split the unified HIN into many single-aspect networks according to the semantic relations and utilize graph filtering to predict user\u2019s behavior on each subgraphs. The following deep neural network is to fuse the personalized predictions in aspect-level. Extensive experiments on two real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our neural graph filtering for CAR.",

        "abstract": "Due to the high efficiency and less weather dependency, autonomous greenhouses provide an ideal solution to meet the increasing demand for fresh food. However, managers are faced with some challenges in finding appropriate control strategies for crop growth, since the decision space of the greenhouse control problem is an astronomical number. Therefore, an intelligent closed-loop control framework is highly desired to generate an automatic control policy. As a powerful tool for optimal control, reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms can surpass human beings\u2019 decision-making and can also be seamlessly integrated into the closed-loop control framework. However, in complex real-world scenarios such as agricultural automation control, where the interaction with the environment is time-consuming and expensive, the application of RL algorithms encounters two main challenges, i.e., sample efficiency and safety. Although model-based RL methods can greatly mitigate the efficiency problem of greenhouse control, the safety problem has not got too much attention. In this paper, we present a model-based robust RL framework for autonomous greenhouse control to meet the sample efficiency and safety challenges. Specifically, our framework introduces an ensemble of environment models to work as a simulator and assist in policy optimization, thereby addressing the low sample efficiency problem. As for the safety concern, we propose a sample dropout module to focus more on worst-case samples, which can help improve the adaptability of the greenhouse planting policy in extreme cases.

However, managers are faced with some challenges in finding appropriate control strategies for crop growth, since the decision space of the greenhouse control problem is an astronomical number. Therefore, an intelligent closed-loop control framework is highly desired to generate an automatic control policy. As a powerful tool for optimal control, reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms can surpass human beings\u2019 decision-making and can also be seamlessly integrated into the closed-loop control framework. However, in complex real-world scenarios such as agricultural automation control, where the interaction with the environment is time-consuming and expensive, the application of RL algorithms encounters two main challenges, i.e., sample efficiency and safety. Although model-based RL methods can greatly mitigate the efficiency problem of greenhouse control, the safety problem has not got too much attention. In this paper, we present a model-based robust RL framework for autonomous greenhouse control to meet the sample efficiency and safety challenges. Specifically, our framework introduces an ensemble of environment models to work as a simulator and assist in policy optimization, thereby addressing the low sample efficiency problem. As for the safety concern, we propose a sample dropout module to focus more on worst-case samples, which can help improve the adaptability of the greenhouse planting policy in extreme cases. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach can learn a more effective greenhouse planting policy with better robustness than existing methods.}\n}",

With the proposed semi-open attribute extraction system (SOAE), more attribute-value pairs can be discovered by extracting literal triples without the limitation of pre-defined ontology. An additional co-trained ontology-based attribute extraction model is appended as a component following the assumption of the partial-closed world (PCWA), remission the performance degradation of SOAE caused by missing of the literal predicate in raw text and contribute to extract richer attribute triples and construct more dense knowledge graph. For evaluating the performance of the attribute extraction system, we construct a Chinese functional description text dataset CNShipNet and conduct experiments on it. The experimental results demonstrate that our proposed approach outperforms several state-of-the-art baselines with a large margin.",

Specifically, we consider the setting that there is a single teacher neuron with quadratic activation, where over-parametrization is realized by having multiple student neurons learn the data generated from the teacher neuron. We provably show that over-parametrization helps the iterate generated by gradient descent to enter the neighborhood of a global optimal solution that achieves zero testing error faster.}\n}",

        "abstract": "Single-shot EPI(ssEPI) is one of the most important ultrafast MRI sequences commonly used for diffusion-weighted MRI and functional MRI. However, ssEPI suffers from susceptibility artifacts, especially in the high field or at the tissue boundaries. The widely used blip/down approaches, such as TOPUP, estimate the underlying distortion field from a pair of images with reversed-phase encoding direction. Typically, the iterative methods are used to find a solution to the ill-posed problem of finding the displacement map that maps up/down acquisitions onto each other. Then the geometric and intensity corrections are applied to obtain the undistorted images based on the estimated displacement map. This paper presents a new unsupervised cycle-consistent deep neural network that takes advantage of both the deep neural network and the gradient reversal method. The proposed method consists of three main components: (1) the Resnet50-Unet to map the pair of images with inverted phase encoding to the displacement maps; (2) the geometric and intensity correction module to obtain the undistorted images; (3) the forward model is applied to get the cycled blip up/down images, and the cycle-consistent loss is optimized. In addition, the CNN network will generate two field maps to overcome motion or field drift during the scan. This new network is trained unsupervised on the clinical datasets downloaded from the Human Connection Project website. And we test this method on both preclinical and clinical datasets. The preclinical dataset is collected from 20 mice based on the modified EPI pulse sequence in 7T scanner.
