Most existing works rely on customer reviews to make an prediction. However, in practice, the customer reviews for new restaurants are always missing. In this paper, we mine useful features from the information of restaurants as well as highly available urban data to tackle this problem. We propose a deep-learning based approach called MR-Net to model both endogenous and exogenous factors in a unified manner and capture deep feature interaction for rating score prediction. Extensive experiments on real world data from Dianping show that our approach achieves better performance than various baseline methods. To the best of our knowledge, it is the first work that predicts rating scores for new restaurants without the knowledge of customer reviews.",

Based on the characteristics of both, sentiment classification can be regarded as a more abstractive summarization task. According to the scheme, a Self-Attentive Hierarchical model for jointly improving text Summarization and Sentiment Classification (SAHSSC) is proposed in this paper. This model jointly performs abstractive text summarization and sentiment classification within a hierarchical end-to-end neural framework, in which the sentiment classification layer on top of the summarization layer predicts the sentiment label in the light of the text and the generated summary. Furthermore, a self-attention layer is also proposed in the hierarchical framework, which is the bridge that connects the summarization layer and the sentiment classification layer and aims at capturing emotional information at text-level as well as summary-level.

We discover that this phenomenon is due to the change of DBM layers\u2019 input signals during model parameter updates, similar to other deterministic deep networks such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) or Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs). The change of layers\u2019 input distributions not only complicates the learning process but also causes redundant neurons that simply imitate the others\u2019 behaviors. Although this phenomenon can be coped using batch normalization in deep learning, integrating this technique into the probabilistic network of DBMs is a challenging problem since it has to satisfy two conditions of energy function and conditional probabilities. In this paper, we introduce Batch Normalized Deep Boltzmann Machines (BNDBMs) that meet both aforementioned conditions and successfully combine batch normalization and DBMs into the same framework. However, unlike CNNs, due to the probabilistic nature of DBMs, training DBMs with batch normalization has some differences: i) fixing shift parameters $\\bnshift$ but learning scale parameters $\\bnscale$; ii) avoiding normalizing the first hidden layer and iii) maintaining multiple pairs of population means and variances per neuron rather than one pair in CNNs. We observe that our proposed BNDBMs can stabilize the input signals of network layers and facilitate the training process as well as improve the model quality. More interestingly, BNDBMs can be trained successfully without pretraining, which is usually a mandatory step in most existing DBMs. The experimental results in MNIST, Fashion-MNIST and Caltech 101 Silhouette datasets show that our BNDBMs outperform DBMs and centered DBMs in terms of feature representation and classification accuracy ($3.98%$ and $5.84%$ average improvement for pretraining and no pretraining respectively).",

        "abstract": "Multi-agent system is crucial for many practical applications. Recent years have witnessed numerous research on multi-agent task with reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms. Traditional reinforcement learning algorithms often fail to learn the cooperation between different agents, which is vital for multi-agent problems. A promising solution is to establish a communication protocol among agents.

        "abstract": "Graph clustering has attracted much attention in recent years, which has wide applications in social and biological networks. Recent approaches on graph clustering mainly focus on either certain graphs with node attributes or uncertain graphs without node attributes. However, many real-world graphs have both uncertainty on the edges and attributes on the nodes. We refer to such networks as \\emph{attributed uncertain graphs}. Different from conventional graphs, attributed uncertain graphs post two major challenges for graph clustering: 1) uncertainty on the edges, which makes it difficult to extract reliable clusters; 2) high dimensional attributes on the nodes, which contain irrelevant and noisy information. In this paper, we study the problem of node clustering on attributed uncertain graphs, where we exploit both the uncertain edges and a set of important attributes for graph clustering. The uncertain edges can help identify the set of relevant attributes in the nodes, which are called focus attributes. While the focus attributes can help reduce the uncertainty in edges for graph clustering. We propose two novel approaches: AUG-I based upon integrated attribute induced graphs and AUG-U based upon the unified partition over possible worlds of a uncertain graph. Extensive empirical studies on real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our approaches for clustering tasks on attributed uncertain graphs.",

However, many real-world graphs have both uncertainty on the edges and attributes on the nodes. We refer to such networks as \\emph{attributed uncertain graphs}. Different from conventional graphs, attributed uncertain graphs post two major challenges for graph clustering: 1) uncertainty on the edges, which makes it difficult to extract reliable clusters; 2) high dimensional attributes on the nodes, which contain irrelevant and noisy information. In this paper, we study the problem of node clustering on attributed uncertain graphs, where we exploit both the uncertain edges and a set of important attributes for graph clustering. The uncertain edges can help identify the set of relevant attributes in the nodes, which are called focus attributes. While the focus attributes can help reduce the uncertainty in edges for graph clustering. We propose two novel approaches: AUG-I based upon integrated attribute induced graphs and AUG-U based upon the unified partition over possible worlds of a uncertain graph. Extensive empirical studies on real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our approaches for clustering tasks on attributed uncertain graphs.}\n}",

To fill this gap, in this paper, we propose the framework of Deep Embedded Clustering with Data Augmentation (DEC-DA). Specifically, we first train an autoencoder with the augmented data to construct the initial feature space. Then we constrain the embedded features with a clustering loss to further learn clustering-oriented features.

This is analogous to supervised training with data augmentation and expected to facilitate unsupervised clustering too. Finally, we instantiate five DEC-DA based algorithms.

We provide mechanisms which can determine the optimal or an almost optimal player in a small number of parallel rounds and at the same time using a small number of competitions.}\n}",

Considering the computational complexity of MDNet is mainly caused by the large amount of convolution operations and fine-tuning of the network during tracking, a RoIPool layer which could conduct the convolution over the whole image instead of each RoI is added to accelerate the convolution and a new strategy of fine-tuning the fully-connected layers is used to accelerate the update.

However, the original GPLVM and its variants do not explicitly model the correlations among the original features, leading to the underutilization of underlying information involved in the data. To compensate for this shortcoming, we propose a feature-correlation-aware GPLVM (fcaGPLVM) to simultaneously learn the latent variables and the feature correlations. The main contributions of this paper are 1) introducing a set of extra latent variables into the original GPLVM and proposing a feature-correlation-aware kernel function to explicitly model  the feature-description information and infer the feature correlations; 2) defining a joint objective function and developing a stochastic optimization algorithm based on the stochastic variational inference (SVI) to learn all the latent variables. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that explicitly considers the feature correlations in the GPLVM and makes many existing GPLVMs become its special cases. Furthermore, it can be applied to both unsupervised and supervised learnings to improve the performance of dimension reduction.

        "abstract": "Class imbalance is an intrinsic characteristic of multi-label data. Most of the labels in multi-label data sets are associated with a small number of training examples, much smaller compared to the size of the data set. Class imbalance poses a key challenge that plagues most multi-label learning methods.

Some existing works use traditional variational autoencoder (VAE) for anomaly detection. They generally assume a single-modal Gaussian distribution as prior in the data generative procedure. However, because of the intrinsic multimodality in time series data, previous works cannot effectively learn the complex data distribution, and hence cannot make accurate detections. To tackle this challenge, in this paper, we propose a GRU-based Gaussian Mixture VAE system for anomaly detection, called GGM-VAE. In particular, Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) cells are employed to discover the correlations among time sequences. Then we use Gaussian Mixture priors in the latent space to characterize multimodal data. The proposed detector reports an anomaly when the reconstruction probability is below a certain threshold.

        "abstract": "Clustering is a fundamental machine learning task and can be used in many applications. With the development of deep neural networks (DNNs), combining techniques from DNNs with clustering has become a new research direction and achieved some success. However, few studies have focused on the imbalanced-data problem which commonly occurs in real-world applications. In this paper, we propose a clustering method, regularized deep embedding clustering (RDEC), that integrates virtual adversarial training (VAT), a network regularization technique, with a clustering method called deep embedding clustering (DEC). DEC optimizes cluster assignments by pushing data more densely around centroids in latent space, but it is sometimes sensitive to the initial location of centroids, especially in the case of imbalanced data, where the minor class has less chance to be assigned a good centroid. RDEC introduces regularization using VAT to ensure the model\u2019s robustness to local perturbations of data. VAT pushes data that are similar in the original space closer together in the latent space, bunching together data from minor classes and thereby facilitating cluster identification by RDEC. Combining the advantages of DEC and VAT, RDEC attains state-of-the-art performance on both balanced and imbalanced benchmark/real-world datasets. For example, accuracies are as high as 98.41% on MNIST dataset and 85.45% on a highly imbalanced dataset derived from the MNIST, which is nearly 8% higher than the current best result.",

Extensive experiments on several benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach against the state-of-the-art methods.}\n}",

        "abstract": "Inference using deep neural networks may be outsourced to the cloud due to its high computational cost, which, however, raises security concerns. Particularly, the data involved in deep neural networks can be highly sensitive, such as in medical, financial, commercial applications, and hence should be kept private. Besides, the deep neural network models owned by research institutions or commercial companies are their valuable intellectual properties and can contain proprietary information, which should be protected as well. Moreover, an untrusted cloud service provider may return accurate and even erroneous computing results. To address the above issues, we propose a secure outsourcing framework for deep neural network inference called SecureNets, which can preserve both a user\u2019s data privacy and his/her neural network model privacy, and also verify the computation results returned by the cloud. Specifically, we employ a secure matrix transformation scheme in SecureNets to avoid privacy leakage of the data and the model. Meanwhile, we propose a verification method that can efficiently verify the correctness of cloud computing results. Our simulation results on four- and five-layer deep neural networks demonstrate that SecureNets can reduce the processing runtime by up to $64%$. Compared with CryptoNets, one of the previous schemes, SecureNets can increase the throughput by $104.45%$ while reducing the data transmission size by $69.78%$ per instance.",

        "abstract": "Heterogeneous domain adaptation (HDA), which aims to adapt information across domains with different input feature spaces, has attracted a lot of attention recently. However,  many existing HDA approaches rely on labeled data in the target domain, which is either scarce or even absent in many tasks. In this paper, we propose a novel unsupervised heterogeneous domain adaptation approach to bridge the representation gap between the source and target domains. The proposed method learns a sparse feature transformation function based on the data in both the source and target domains and a small number of existing parallel instances. The learning problem is formulated as a sparsity regularized optimization problem and an ADMM algorithm is developed to solve it. We conduct experiments on several real-world domain adaptation datasets and the experimental results validate the advantages of the proposed method over existing unsupervised heterogeneous domain adaptation approaches.",

        "abstract": "In this paper, we propose an automatic hand-raiser recognition algorithm to show who raise their hands in real classroom scenarios, which is of great importance for further analyzing the learning states of individuals. To recognize the hand-raisers, we divide the hand-raiser recognition into three subproblems, including hand-raising detection, pose estimation, and matching the raised hands to students. Several challenges exist while dealing with the above-mentioned subproblems, such as low resolution of the back row for keypoints detection, the motion distortion caused by hand raising in pose estimation, and various complex situations for matching. To solve these challenges, we first adopt an improved R-FCN algorithm for hand-raising detection, whose effectiveness has been demonstrated. Secondly, we present a novel PAF-based pose estimation algorithm for detecting keypoints of human bodies. The proposed PAF adds scale search and modified weight metric to adapt to the real and complex scenarios. Specifically, scale search improves the detection effect at low resolution by pooling human characteristics in different sizes of pictures, and modified weight metric reasonably utilizes the directional vectors of possible limb connections to optimize the case of motion distortion. Thirdly, a heuristic matching strategy based on the location of hand-raising and keypoints information is proposed to recognize the hand-raisers. Experimental results on six teaching videos in real classrooms have demonstrated the efficiency of the proposed algorithm, and 83% recognition accuracy indicates the potential applications in real classrooms.",

ZoomNet learns and aggregates deep feature representations at multiple levels and retains the spatial information of the pedestrian from different scales.
