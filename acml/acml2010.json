In this paper, we propose to exploit this phenomenon in the data stream context by building an ensemble of Hoeffding trees that are each limited to a small subset of attributes. In this way, each tree is restricted to model interactions between attributes in its corresponding subset. Because it is not known a priori which attribute subsets are relevant for prediction, we build exhaustive ensembles that consider all possible attribute subsets of a given size. As the resulting Hoeffding trees are not all equally important, we weigh them in a suitable manner to obtain accurate classifications. This is done by combining the log-odds of their probability estimates using sigmoid perceptrons, with one perceptron per class. We propose a mechanism for setting the perceptrons\u2019 learning rate using the ADWIN change detection method for data streams, and also use ADWIN to reset ensemble members (i.e. Hoeffding trees) when they no longer perform well. Our experiments show that the resulting ensemble classifier outperforms bagging for data streams in terms of accuracy when both are used in conjunction with adaptive naive Bayes Hoeffding trees, at the expense of runtime and memory consumption.",

CHNMF factorizes a non-negative data matrix $V$ into two non-negative matrix factors $V \\approx WH$ such that the columns of $W$ are convex combinations of certain data points so that they are readily interpretable to data analysts. There is, however, no free lunch: imposing convexity constraints on W typically prevents adaptation to intrinsic, low dimensional structures in the data. Alas, in cases where the data is distributed in a non-convex manner or consists of mixtures of lower dimensional convex distributions, the cluster representatives obtained from CH-NMF will be less meaningful. In this paper, we present a hierarchical CH-NMF that automatically adapts to internal structures of a dataset, hence it yields meaningful and interpretable clusters for non-convex datasets. This is also confirmed by our extensive evaluation on DBLP publication records of $760,000$ authors, $4,000,000$ images harvested from the web, and $150,000,000$ votes on World of Warcraft guilds.",

Discretization is fundamental for machine learning and data mining, since every continuous datum; e.g., a real-valued datum obtained by observation in the real world, must be discretized and converted from analog (continuous) to digital (discrete) form to store in databases. However, most machine learning methods do not pay attention to the situation; i.e., they use digital data in actual applications on a computer whereas assume analog data (usually vectors of real numbers) theoretically. To bridge the gap, we propose a novel measure of the difference between two sets of data, called the coding divergence, and unify two processes discretization and learning computationally. Discretization of continuous data is realized by a topological mapping (in the sense of mathematics) from the $d$-dimensional Euclidean space $\\mathbb{R}^d$ into the Cantor space $\\Sigma^\\omega$, and the simplest model is learned in the Cantor space, which corresponds to the minimum open set separating the given two sets of data. Furthermore, we construct a classifier using the divergence, and experimentally demonstrate robust performance of it. Our contribution is not only introducing a new measure from the computational point of view, but also triggering more interaction between experimental science and machine learning.",
